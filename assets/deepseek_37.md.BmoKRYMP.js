You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. On Monday, departing Gov. Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"He understood in Georgia there was a shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor\\" correctly answer the question \\"What problem did Barnes understand before becoming governor?\\"? Pick from: + no; + yes;","output":"+ yes; Before becoming governor, Roy Barnes understood there was a shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor in Georgia. His decision to work as a full-time, pro-bono lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society demonstrates his commitment to the underserved and the accessibility of legal services for the less fortunate. The numbers reported in the passage reveal the stark reality of the situation in Georgia, with only one legal aid lawyer available for every 10,500 eligible poor people. This scarcity of representation was something Barnes recognized and had actively contributed to addressing during his time in private practice. His experience handling pro-bono cases and volunteering at the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society showed that Barnes was well aware of the systemic problem long before he assumed public office. His notable work in securing a 115 million judgment against Fleet Finance for their predatory lending mortgage practices that largely affected vulnerable homeowners, many of whom were senior citizens, illustrates his dedication to fighting injustice and advocating for equal access to legal representation. The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is a widespread issue, and Barnes' decision to return to legal aid work after his time as governor garnered media attention, shedding light on the ongoing struggle to ensure equal access to justice for millions of Americans who cannot afford proper legal representation. Unfortunately, despite the requirement for all practicing lawyers to promote justice and the inclusion of ethical rules in every state's guidelines, the percentage of pro-bono service remains low. In Georgia, only 23% of the state's active lawyers reported reaching the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. Taking these statistics into account, it becomes evident that Barnes had a clear understanding of the problem at hand—the shortage of legal aid lawyers for the poor in Georgia—prior to his time as governor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use thin, even layers while avoiding heavy application, which can take longer to dry or cause unevenness. 7. Allow the paint to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, similar to drying times for a canvas. Do not attempt to cure the paint unless the product's guidelines explicitly mention this step. 8. After the paint dries, carefully remove any pencil markings or stencils if used. 9.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema (or, indeed, most anything done outside these holier-than-thou United States) are the permutations that crop up. In post-World War Two Japanese manga (comics), for instance, are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects, many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion. The same thing happens in genre film-making, as well; though, again, I'm referring to movies made outside the U.. (where we're just too \\"sophisticated\\" in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that isn't about or by US). Would an American company, for instance, back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real-life martial artist (Bruce Lee)...? As for television: forget it. While I still love the KUNG FU series that starred the late David Carradine, I've always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts was- how to put it kindly- a bit lacking. To this very day, there hasn't been a pay-per-view channel to feature Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia. (There are lots of soft-core porn masquerading as entertainment shows, but the so-called Action Channel, for instance, has yet to import or to produce a True Martial Arts teleseries.) Before Brother Cadfile was investigating murders on the BBC, there was, of all things, at least one Kung Fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery: THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS. In its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit (western, cop show, etc.), this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work. It's now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is EXACTLY the kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve. If you're a martial arts movie fan, rejoice: one of the greatest movie genres of all time (specifically, the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s) are getting a long-overdue second life (and greatly appreciated second look) on DVD.","output":"To determine the sentiment of the review, I will analyze the overall tone and language used by the reviewer.  1. Positive sentiment: The reviewer starts by appreciating the variety and creativity of Asian cinema and manga, stating that these are \\"handled in uniquely imaginative fashion.\\" This shows a positive sentiment towards the content discussed. 2.

This suggests a negative sentiment towards the contrast being made between the US and Asian cinema industries. 3. Positive sentiment: The reviewer praises the movie \\"The 5 Deadly Venoms\\" describing it as a \\"martial arts masterpiece\\" and a \\"truly superior piece of work.\\" This shows a positive sentiment towards this specific movie. 4. Positive sentiment: The mention of the DVD release by Dragon Dynasty is met with approval by the reviewer stating that \\"the print is beautiful\\" and the commentary by Bey Logan is \\"EXACTLY the kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve.\\" This adds another positive element to the review. 5. Positive sentiment: The final statement discusses the \\"greatest movie genres of all time\\" (referring to the martial arts movies) being given a second life and look on DVD, resulting in a positive sentiment towards the overall theme of the review.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a herd of zebras together in a savannah.","output":"In the given sentence, the most important words are \\"herd,\\" \\"zebras,\\" \\"together,\\" and \\"savannah.\\" 1. \\"herd\\": The word \\"herd\\" is important because it signifies a group of animals, in this case, zebras, which tells us that the subject of the sentence is a collective of animals sharing similar characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, this indicates that the focus of the sentence is on the social aspect of these animals in terms of how they form groups to fulfill their needs, such as finding food, seeking protection, or reproducing. 2. \\"zebras\\": The word \\"zebras\\" specifically identifies which animals are present within this herd. It plays a crucial role in understanding the topic and setting the context for further analysis. The choice of species is important since different animals have their own behaviors, appearances, and habitats. Consequently, zebras, as a species, provide a sense of the environment (savannah) and the social structure (herd behavior) essential for the visual and ecological understanding of the scene. 3. \\"together\\": The word \\"together\\" highlights the coexistence and interaction of the zebras within the herd. It implies that there is a collective behavior among these animals as they share the same space and engage in activities as a group. This allows the reader to infer why these particular animals might be together, such as for safety against predators or to find food more efficiently. Understanding this aspect of the sentence deepens the reader's appreciation of the social dynamics and behaviors of the zebras in their natural habitat. 4. \\"savannah\\": The word \\"savannah\\" establishes the setting in which this herd of zebras is found. This provides valuable information regarding their natural habitat and environmental conditions. The savannah is a tropical grassland ecosystem consisting of mixed tree and grass cover, often associated with African wildlife. Mentioning the savannah not only creates a vivid image for the reader but also helps to link the zebras' collective behavior to broader ecological factors and adaptations necessary for survival in their specific environment. In conclusion, the importance of these words lies in their ability to effectively convey key elements in the sentence, such as the subject (herd of zebras), context (together), and setting (savannah). These words enable the reader to grasp the meaning of the sentence while painting a comprehensive picture of the scene described."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Sir Wilfred's doctor has instructed him to avoid excitement. After his hand-picked replacement barrister expresses doubt over Vole's innocence, Sir Wilfred decides to handle the case himself, despite protests from his nurse (Elsa Lanchester) and doctor.After a conversation with Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich), Sir Wilfred decides not to call on her to testify in defense of her husband.In the courtroom, Christine Vole surprisingly appears as a Witness for the Prosecution. A parade of circumstantial evidence points to murder. Christine's testimony does not provide an alibi for her husband.All seems lost as the defense concludes its case. But a late night phone call reveals new evidence that Christine wrote letters to her lover about denying her husband an alibi. This evidence changes the jury's opinion and Leonard is acquitted. However, Sir Wilfred suspects something is amiss with this sudden reversal and dramatic evidence.All is revealed in the last dramatic court scene, as Christine admits to deliberately sabotaging her own testimony with the letters, to get her guilty husband freed. But in the penultimate twist, Leonard shows his true stripes and reveals his intention to leave his \\"wife\\" for a younger woman.

But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species.  Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo.  To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. What is the main reason for the South China tiger becoming one of the world's top ten most endangered species? A) Because it has lost its natural instincts. B) Because there is not a complete eco-chain. C) Because there is no space for it. D) Because of uncontrolled hunting and destroyed its natural living conditions.

The song is by the American rock band Steely Dan, which was formed by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Elliot Randall was not a member of Steely Dan but was brought in as a session musician for the recording of the song. His solo on \\"Reeling in the Years\\" has become one of the most famous and highly regarded guitar solos in rock music history. The impressive solo is often praised for its unique melodic structure, precision, and technical prowess. The story behind Randall's involvement with Steely Dan is quite interesting. One of the members of Steely Dan, Denny Dias, was a mutual friend of Randall and invited him to the session. Initially, Randall came into the studio to help with some equipment, but Dias and producer Gary Katz suggested he give the solo a try. Randall recorded the now-famous solo in just one take, which ultimately made it into the final version of the song. It was also Dias who played the rhythm guitar on the track, with a distinctive staccato style, providing the perfect foundation for Randall's solo. Over time, the popularity and recognition of the guitar solo on \\"Reeling in the Years\\" have continued to grow. Many musicians and critics have praised Elliot Randall's performance, making it a benchmark for aspiring guitarists and an iconic piece of rock history.

Greek flags are seen decorating the facade of a central Athens hotel the day after celebrations marking Greece's Independence Day March 26, 2015. Greece's economy minister said on Thursday he believed the government would reach a deal with its euro zone peers on planned...      ATHENS Greece's deputy finance minister said on Monday Germany owes Greece nearly 279 billion euros (204.98 billion pounds) in reparations for the Nazi occupation of the country.      Greek governments and also private citizens have pushed for war damages from Germany for decades but the Greek government has never officially quantified its reparation claims.      A parliamentary panel set up by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's government started work last week, seeking to claim German debts, including war reparations, as well as the repayment of a so-called occupation loan that Nazi Germany forced the Bank of Greece to make and the return of stolen archaeological treasures.      Speaking at parliamentary committee, Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said Berlin owed Athens 278.7 billion euros, according to calculations by the country's General Accounting Office. The occupation loan amounts to 10.3 billion euros.      The campaign for compensation has gained momentum in the past few years as Greeks have suffered hardship under austerity measures imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for bailouts totalling 240 billion euros to save Greece from bankruptcy.      Tsipras has frequently blamed Germany for the hardship stemming from the imposition of austerity. He has angered Berlin by threatening to push for reparations in the middle of talks to unlock aid for Greece.      Germany has repeatedly rejected Greece's claims and says it has honoured its obligations, including a 115 million deutschmark payment to Greece in 1960.      (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris. Editing by Jane Merriman) ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Tsipras honoured Greek resistance fighters who were executed by Nazi occupation forces      The Greek government says Germany owes Greece nearly €279bn (£204bn; 303bn) in war reparations for the Nazi occupation during World War Two.      It is the first time Greece has officially calculated what Germany allegedly owes it for Nazi atrocities and looting during the 1940s.      However, the German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago.      Greece's radical left Syriza government is making the claim while struggling to meet massive debt repayment deadlines.      Reacting to the Greek claim, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was \\"dumb\\" to link Greece's bailout by the eurozone with the question of war reparations.      \\"To be honest I think it's dumb. I think that it doesn't move us forward one millimetre on the question of stabilising Greece,\\" he said.      He said ordinary Greek citizens however deserved \\"huge respect\\" for their economic sacrifices under the bailout programme. The Greek elite had \\"plundered\\" the country, he complained.      'Legally closed'      Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month.      The new figure given by Greek Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas includes €10.3bn for an occupation loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of Greece to pay.      \\"According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,\\" Mr Mardas told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis.      Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office.      Image copyright German Federal Archives Image caption Greece was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941 - here German soldiers raise their flag over the Acropolis      Berlin paid 115m Deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation - a fraction of the Greek demand. Greece says it did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan.      Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990, before Germany reunified.      The budget spokesman for Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats, Eckhardt Rehberg, reiterated on Tuesday that \\"the reparations issue is for us closed, politically and legally - the same applies to the so-called forced loan\\".      Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for Greek citizens' hardship under the austerity imposed by international lenders.      Mr Tsipras is trying to renegotiate the €240bn EU-IMF bailout that saved Greece from bankruptcy. Greece has not received bailout funds since August last year, as the lenders are dissatisfied with the pace of Greek reforms.      A Greek repayment of €448m to the International Monetary Fund is due this Thursday.

Please answer the following question: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B.  Which reservior would most likely have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B?  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","output":"Based on the given information and hint, we can break down the reasoning as follows: 1. Both reservoirs have a seasonal water level that is lowered in the winter by around 10 feet. 2. The lowering of water levels helps in maintaining excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. 3. Reservoir A has an engineer who has let the water out in the fall, following the seasonal pattern. 4. Reservoir B does not have an engineer this year to regulate the water release, so there is no one to let the water out in the fall. 5. Since letting out water in the fall contributes to excellent water quality, reservoir A, which has followed this practice, is more likely to have excellent water quality compared to reservoir B.

Some of these compounds, such as sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases, can have negative impacts on air quality and human respiratory health. When these particles and gases are inhaled, they may irritate the respiratory system and hinder the process of absorbing oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the increased particulate matter in the air could potentially make oxygen less accessible and force the respiratory system to work harder, leading to an increased demand for oxygen in the body. While this effect is indirect, it could still have a noticeable impact on the overall efficiency of the oxygenation process. - Not impacting any step of the process: Possible, but unlikely. While the oxygenation process itself may not be directly impacted by volcanic activity or pressure build-up in lava chambers, it would be rare for there to be no connection between the two at all, especially in the case of an eruption. The indirect impact of a volcanic eruption on overall air quality and human respiratory health would make it harder to argue that there is no impact whatsoever. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation related to aggravated lava chambers and pressure build-up would most likely be indirectly impacting a step of the oxygenation process. This impact could stem from the release of volcanic ash, gases, and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which may irritate the respiratory system and hinder the absorption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide. It is essential to consider the wider environmental and health implications of volcanic activity and its potential effects on overall respiratory efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide on an eye-catching halo.","output":"Title: Crafting the Ultimate Angel Costume: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction When it comes to the enchantment of dressing up for Halloween or costume parties - or transforming into heavenly beings for theatrical performances - few things can capture the imagination quite like donning an ethereal angel costume. Here, we delve into the art of creating the perfect angel ensemble, breaking down all the necessary elements to ensure that you soar as a celestial being. From choosing a light-colored gown or long t-shirt to selecting perfect wings and deciding on an eye-catching halo, we've got you covered. 1. Selecting the Ideal Base: Light-Colored Gown or Long T-Shirt The foundation of an exceptional angel costume is vital, and it begins with selecting your ensemble's base attire. Opting for a light-colored gown or a long t-shirt serves as the appropriate canvas to evoke a transcendent aura. • Light-Colored Gown: When choosing a gown, search for flowing fabrics such as chiffon or silk to create a cascading appearance. Stick to lighter shades like white, ecru, or silver to represent purity and light. Long, loose sleeves or angel-sleeve designs amplify the otherworldly appeal. Additionally, consider the length of the gown; a floor-length skirt with a subtle train creates a delicate yet dramatic effect. • Long T-shirt: A more casual, budget-friendly option is utilizing a long t-shirt as your base. Extra-large, knee-length t-shirts in light shades of white, cream, or pastel colors retain the ethereal aesthetic. To make the t-shirt appear more robe-like, you can gather fabric at the back or cinch the waist with a decorative sash or belt. 2. Choosing the Perfect Wings One of the most iconic aspects of an angel costume is the wings. While considering the size, color, and material composition, you must find a pair that complements your gown or t-shirt and doesn't overwhelm your entire ensemble. • Size: Decide between large, sweeping wings for a more striking appearance or smaller, delicate wings for a subtle, celestial charm. • Color: Coordinate the wing color with your base attire - white, silver, or gold are all suitable choices. Some may prefer iridescent or glittery wings for added shimmer and glitz. • Material: Feathered wings can lend an organic, authentic feel to your costume, whereas wire-framed wings with translucent fabric can offer a more fantastical aesthetic. Consider the weight of the wings, ensuring that they are comfortable to wear throughout the event. 3. Deciding on an Eye-Catching Halo No angel costume is complete without the quintessential halo. The perfect halo should look heavenly, yet not distract from the overall outfit. • Material: The halo can be crafted from a variety of materials such as wire, tinsel, or floral accents. Wire halo with beads or crystals provides a minimalist but captivating effect, while tinsel or garland halos can add a touch of sparkle and playfulness. • Attachment: Consider how the halo will be secured to your head. Options include a headband-style attachment, which typically offers a comfortable fit and stable positioning, or attaching the halo to clips or hair combs to nestle seamlessly into your hairstyle. • Additional Embellishments: To elevate your halo, you can adorn it with flowers, ribbon, pearls, or other costume jewels. Coordinate these embellishments with the other aspects of your costume to ensure a cohesive and mesmerizing appearance. Conclusion Pulling off the ultimate angel costume is within your grasp by carefully selecting the ideal base, wings, and halo. By committing attention to detail and focusing on color, material, and style, your celestial transformation will leave an impression that no one will soon forget. Step into your divine role as an angel and make a heavenly statement at any event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

While the appointment of Diaz-Canel as the president of Cuba may not lead to drastic change, his promise to continue the Castros' socialist revolution signifies the faith he has in the political ideologies of his predecessors. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel stated.

Diaz-Canel is succeeding 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after serving 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel Castro, played a significant role in the Cuban political landscape as he served as prime minister and president following the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959. However, his reign ended in 2006 due to health issues. Though the leadership transition is bringing younger leaders like Diaz-Canel to the forefront, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, predominantly because of their stronghold on the Communist Party. As Castro remains the party leader, Diaz-Canel is quoted as saying, \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country.\\" He also emphasized that \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.\\" Castro informed the members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two terms as president and is likely to succeed him as the head of the Communist Party eventually. As the new president of Cuba, Diaz-Canel will face the challenge of improving the country's economic state and bringing prosperity to its Caribbean nation. The present condition of the Cuban economy is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was backed by the former Soviet Union. In conclusion, Miguel Diaz-Canel is excited to take on the role of President of Cuba, succeeding Raul Castro, and is committed to leading the country by continuing the revolutionary principles and socialist vision of the Castros."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Nick Clegg said Lib Dems would pursue higher ratio of tax rises to cuts. Would involve ‘at least’ £8billion in tax rise in shift towards Labour position. David Cameron condemned the move, saying it would hit ordinary families.","output":"Title: Nick Clegg's Announcement For Higher Tax Rises, A Shift Towards Labour Position, Sparks Reactions From David Cameron Introduction: The political landscape in the United Kingdom has once again stirred up conversations as the Liberal Democrats' (Lib Dems) leader, Nick Clegg, announces intentions to pursue higher tax rises to fund public services. As the British public looks to the upcoming party manifestos for each of the parties, there seem to be a shift in the Lib Dems’ stance, inching closer to the Labour party's position on taxes. Body: Nick Clegg’s statement on pursuing a higher ratio of tax rises to cuts essentially proposes increasing taxes by ‘at least’ £8 billion. This move is aimed at bolstering public services and reducing the country's deficit. Clegg's planned policy appears to align his party with the Labour party, staking a claim in solidarity against austerity measures that have been previously enforced by the coalition government led by the Conservatives. The Lib Dems’ announcement represents an ideological shift toward the center-left, particularly in terms of their economic policies. Traditionally, the Lib Dems have championed a more centrist position; however, this proposed tax rise seems to gravitate toward Labour's stance on taxation and public spending. Speculation suggests that this tactical move may likely be a response to the upcoming general elections, as parties are fine-tuning their political messaging in hope of garnering voter support. However, this proposed tax rise has sparked fierce condemnation from the Conservative Party, specifically their leader David Cameron. He criticized the Lib Dems' proposal, arguing that such a plan would adversely impact ordinary hardworking families in the UK. Cameron's denunciation of Clegg's tax plan signifies that the Conservatives remain committed to their stance on lowering the tax burden and promoting fiscal responsibility. Furthermore, Cameron's disapproval appears to align with the belief that increasing the tax burden on working families during the ongoing recovery from the financial crisis would pose a significant strain on their financial stability. The Conservatives’ concerns over the potential negative consequences of raising taxes seem to underline their core belief in maintaining a competitive business environment, reducing the fiscal burden on working families, and keeping public finances in check. Conclusion: As the UK's political parties gear up for the upcoming general elections, economic policies and party positions are coming under scrutiny. Nick Clegg’s announcement to pursue higher tax rises and aligning Lib Dems closer to the Labour party’s stance has raised eyebrows and invited criticism from political opponents. With David Cameron condemning this proposal, stating that it would harm ordinary families, the ensuing political debate becomes a key reflection of each parties' vision for the country's economic future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Do you want to live with a strong sense of peacefulness,happiness,goodness,and  selfrespect?The collection  of happiness actions broadly categorized  (......)  as \\"honor\\" help you create this life of good feelings. Here's an example to show how honorable actions create happiness. Say a store clerk fails to charge us for an item.If we keep silent,and profit from the clerk's mistake,we would drive home with a sense of sneaky   excitement.Later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune.On the other hand,if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item,the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty.We would leave the store with a quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul. Then,what is it to do with our sense of happiness? In the first case,where we don't tell the clerk,a couple of things would happen.Deep down inside we would know ourselves as a type of thief.In the process,we would lose some peace of  mind  and  selfrespect.We  would also demonstrate that we cannot be trusted,since we advertise our dishonor by telling our family and friends.We damage our own reputations by telling others.In contrast, _ causes  different  things  to happen.Immediately the clerk knows us to be honorable.Upon leaving the store,we feel honorable and our selfrespect is increased.Whenever we take honorable actions we gain the deep internal rewards of goodness and a sense of nobility. There is a beautiful positive cycle that is created by living a life of honorable actions.Honorable  thoughts lead  to honorable actions.Honorable actions lead us to a happier existence.And it's easy to think and act honorably again when we're happy.While the positive cycle can be difficult to start,once it's started,it's easy to continue.Keeping on doing good deeds brings us peace of mind,which is important for our happiness.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops.  Which city released less livestock waste into the ocean? A:","output":"To determine which city, Bird city or Pine city, released less livestock waste into the ocean, we must examine their economic practices and geographical locations more closely. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. This means that any waste, including livestock, from the city has a direct route to the ocean through the river. The city relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Conventional agriculture often involves raising large numbers of livestock for food production. The waste generated from these livestock operations usually includes manure and urine. When not managed properly, these waste materials can leak into nearby waterways, eventually reaching the sea. In Bird city, the likelihood of livestock waste reaching the ocean is increased due to its proximity to the river. The use of fertilizers for crops can also contribute to water pollution, as excessive nutrient runoff from fields may reach and contaminate the river. On the other hand, Pine city was located in the mountains and inhabited by nature lovers and people who protected the environment. While the statement doesn't provide information on the specific economic activities of Pine city, it might be reasonable to assume they practiced sustainable agriculture and eco-friendly activities, given their love for the environment. Sustainable agriculture often involves fewer livestock operations and focuses on preserving natural resources, which would contribute to less waste generation. Furthermore, Pine city's mountainous location creates a larger buffer between the livestock waste and the sea, as waste materials would have to travel down the mountain to reach the ocean, lesser the chance of livestock waste reaching the ocean. Given the nature of economic activities and geographical locations of Bird city and Pine city, it can be inferred that Pine city likely releases less livestock waste into the ocean. This conclusion is based on their commitment to environmental protection and sustainable practices as well as their longer distance from the sea. However, it is crucial to consider that making accurate assumptions about both these cities would require more information about each city's specific agricultural practices and waste management systems."},{"instruction":"What is the last name of the person who had several siblings?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

News article: HARPURSVILLE, NY (WCMH) – A New York petting zoo is sharing the joy as they are expecting a baby giraffe to be born.      The Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York is live-streaming as their 15-year-old giraffe, April and her mate, Oliver welcome their baby. The livestream has gained international attention, with several hashtags trending such as #AprilsViewCrew, #TeamEgg and #GiraffeWatch.      Saturday, April 8, The Keeper and Vet said there hadn’t been much change but said that’s a good thing!      All is well on the giraffe front! April keeps us waiting. Keeper and vet reports today have no remarkable change. Though this may seem redundant – it’s actually a good thing! Full udders, huge belly, mom ready – we just need the labor process to begin – so we are waiting for that final stage. Temperatures will climb tomorrow and then we are off to a beautiful week!      Late Saturday, April 1, The Animal Adventure Park said it looked like an April Fool’s Day baby wasn’t the case, but we could see a new baby giraffe any time after midnight!      April continues to ignore her grain, zones in and out of awareness, exhibits soft contraction indications, and is even producing manure size and consistency hinting of a birth – though we are not yet in what we will call “active labor”. Our big girl is comfortable, confident, and continues to keep her composure – better than the rest of us!      However, as of Tuesday morning, we are still waiting for April.      “April has remained off grain again today, toys with her hay, turns up her nose at lettuce, but likes a DR Tim Carrot Treat! Tonight will be another long night as we wait for April to decide just when is right!”      Over the weekend, the park’s vet posted the following information on their Facebook page.      So the timeline for my 24-48 hour prediction is rapidly coming to an end… not surprising is the fact that we still have no calf and we still don’t have a giraffe in Labor! Pretty much all of her clinical signs from a couple days ago are still true. She just isn’t quite ready to give the world what it wants. To answer a few question I have seen on the web in various places: no, she isn’t late; no, she isn’t overdue; no, I’m not concerned she is “taking so long”, nor should you be. Yes she remains happy and comfortable (considering the circumstances). Yes, she will have this calf when she is good and ready. No, public outcry won’t change that. No, I cannot induce her, nor should we want to… (those are human constructs which don’t apply to large wild animals and only endanger the life of April and her calf )Yes, it will be awesome when the calf arrives. No, watching after April is not my only job. Yes, we have been watching her for a very long time… enjoy the <free> show people. Get more popcorn.      On Monday, March 20, April’s zookeepers reported that the calf has been moving and sticking out. A photo accompanied the update on the Animal Adventure Park’s Facebook page. In the photo, you can see a definite lump on April’s round side. “Keeper report is “holy smokes” baby is sticking out. It is very evident in visual observations that the calf is moving up and sticking out! All are happy with progress, we are not in labor at this time,” said the Facebook post.      On Tuesday, March 14, April’s zookeepers reported that the baby was very active. A blizzard brought a lot of snow to the Harpursville, NY area where the zoo is located.      On Sunday, March 12, zoo officials said there was significant movement from the baby in April’s belly.      On Monday, March 6, April’s belly appeared to be larger and she was stealing hay from her mate, Oliver.      On Tuesday, Feb. 28, April and her mate Oliver got to spend time together outside. The park reports that there is not much change in April’s physical appearance. She is carrying the baby a bit higher and tighter.      On Monday, Feb. 27, the park said that April is not yet labor. April’s condition remains the same. Her baby continues to move and the baby’s kicks are noticeably obvious. April laid down for a while, which helps her get the calf get into a more comfortable position. April will likely get to go outside on Monday because temperatures are warming up a bit.      The park shared an adorable photo on Facebook that showed the first time that Oliver and April met, which was about 1 & 1/2 years ago.      Jordan Patch, the owner of the park told Spectrum News that April is in the last stage of her pregnancy. Giraffes have a 15-month gestation period, and April’s tentative due date was mid-February, Patch said. But active labor could still be days away.      “Giraffes hide their signs as a natural instinct, that is why until we see hooves we will not announce active labor,” Patch told NBC4. “Process can take a few hours or a day or so — once hooves appear it will be 60 minutes before it’s out and on the ground. It’s a very natural process, and we can’t put timelines on that.”      READ MORE: The difference between labor in humans and giraffes      When the baby is born it will likely stand around six feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds.      The mother and father are still getting to enjoy yard time, but the park is now keeping them separated due to April’s condition.      “His rambunctious play for an extended period could have negative effects. Boys will be boys,” the park said.      On Wednesday, Feb 22, the park says animal rights activists convinced YouTube to pull the live feed “for violating YouTube’s policy on nudity or sexual content.” The park then issued the following statement on its Facebook page.      Just after 9:00am Thursday morning on February 23, the feed was back up on YouTube after an appeal.      According to CNBC, giraffe populations have been rapidly decimated across Africa and the species is threatened with extinction.      Giraffes were moved from Least Concern list to the Vulnerable list by the IUCN due to a dramatic 36-40% decline from approximately 151,702-163,452 individuals in 1985 to 97,562 in 2015.      The group cited Illegal hunting, habitat loss and changes through expanding agriculture and mining, increasing human-wildlife conflict, and civil unrest as reasons pushing the species towards extinction. Of the nine subspecies of giraffe, three have increasing populations, whilst five have decreasing populations and one is stable, according to the IUCN.      Patch told Spectrum News that he believes the giraffe born at the Animal Adventure Park will be important for the continued viability of the species.

We take pride in our indoor housing and the level of enrichment and care to keep them happy and healthy.            The calf will weigh around 150lb and will be about 6' tall at birth.      The front hooves will come out first followed by the snout.            Mom will naturally raise the calf, with weaning could take between 6-10 months, maybe longer. We will not rush this process – it is just a documented range of captive weaning.            Once the calf is born, we will have a contest to name it.            The keepers will go in with April, clean her pen, give her treats (but not Oliver). He is a bull - and a bull is a bull is a bull!            Giraffes are pregnant for 15 months            Upon naturally weaning, the calf will move on to another facility to start a breeding program there. We cannot retain offspring, as it would lead to incestuous mating and undermine the genetics of the program and species.            Those \\"things\\" on their heads are called ossicones.            Bulls (male giraffes) only really care about two things- fighting and the unmentionable....      Oliver may share space with April, but for short periods. Bulls take no part in rearing young.            They eat hay and specialized giraffe diet but love romaine lettuce and carrot treats.            April's water source, enrichment, and solo hay feeder are out of sight of the camera view.

Which attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft? Answer:","output":"The attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite that is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft is the AH-64 Apache. The AH-64 Apache is a twin-engine, multi-mission attack helicopter developed by the United States Army and used by various countries globally. The Apache was first introduced in 1986 and has since become one of the primary attack helicopters in various militaries, including the United States, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The helicopter is designed to provide firepower and versatility during combat missions. It is often deployed for close air support, armed reconnaissance, and as anti-tank and anti-armor platforms. One crucial feature of the AH-64 Apache is its nose-mounted sensor suite, known as the Target Acquisition Designation Sight, Pilot Night Vision System (TADS/PNVS). This advanced system enables the Apache to navigate and engage targets in low-light or adverse weather conditions, providing it with an edge over other attack helicopters. The TADS/PNVS consists of a number of sensors and systems, including a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera, a Day TV camera, a direct-view optical sight, a laser rangefinder/designator, and a laser spot tracker. These components together allow the Apache's pilots to detect, identify, and engage targets at extended ranges and in various lighting and environmental conditions. In addition to the TADS/PNVS, the Apache is armed with a suite of powerful weapons, including a 30mm M230 chain gun, Hellfire missiles, and Hydra 70 rocket pods. These weapon systems make it a formidable aircraft capable of taking on a range of targets, including tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, and other aircraft. In summary, the AH-64 Apache is the attack helicopter with a nose-mounted sensor suite that is currently under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft. Its combination of advanced technologies, weapons, and survivability make it a critical asset in modern warfare and a vital part of the US Army and other armed forces worldwide."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side,  has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude.  Which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena?  Hint: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. A:","output":"Jolt township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena compared to Burr township. The reason for this difference lies in their altitude and environmental conditions. Burr township, being on the western side and at a lower altitude, experiences more atmospheric convection. Lower altitudes generally have warmer air which rises due to its buoyancy and the presence of temperature differences within the layers of the atmosphere causing instability. This leads to cumulus cloud formation, increased winds, and potentially severe weather events like thunderstorms, hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. On the other hand, Jolt township is situated on the eastern side at a higher altitude and has a less windy and less cloudy environment. Higher altitudes typically have cooler and more stable air masses, reducing the chances of atmospheric convection. The air at higher altitudes does not rise as much as in low altitudes because it is already cooler and more stable, leading to fewer instances of severe weather phenomena. In summary, Jolt township experiences fewer atmospheric convection phenomena due to its higher altitude and more stable environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.   - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991.   - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.  - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members.  - The UEFA Champions League is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association. The final of the 201213 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Article: Imagine living locked inside a closet. You can't choose when and what to eat or how you will spend your time. You can't even decide when the lights go on and off. Think about spending your whole life like this. This is the life of lab animals. Now consider the needs of these animals. Chimpanzees ,in their natural homes, are never separated from their families. They spend hours together every day. But in a lab, chimpanzees are put in cages alone. There are no families, only cold, hard cages, and loneliness that goes on for so many years that most of them lose their minds at last. Worse yet are the experiments. Animals are given diseases they would never normally get. Experimenters force-feed(......) chemicals to them, conduct repeated surgeries ,and much more, Think of what it would be like to put up with these and then be thrown back into a cage, usually without any painkillers. Often animals see other animals being killed right in front of them. Hundreds of thousands of animals are poisoned, blinded, and killed every year in product tests for shampoos, skin creams and new cancer drugs. Although more than 500 companies have stopped testing on animals, some of them still force chemicals into monkeys' stomachs and rabbits' eyes. Although some facilities are better than others at caring for animals--not every lab worker kills a mouse by cutting off its head with scissors--there are no happy animals inside laboratories. Will the lab life end? When will it end? Question: We can infer from the passage that   _  . - some companies have found ways to replace animal tests - animals normally get no strange diseases - animals are happy in labs with better facilities - painkillers can change the results of experiments Answer:","output":"some companies have found ways to replace animal tests"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is not much copper available happens, how will it affect there will be a smaller electrical source produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if there is not much copper available, there will be a smaller electrical source produced. To assess the effect of this change on the process, let's look at each step in the process and consider changes caused by the perturbation. Step 1: A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - Perturbation effect: With less copper available, either the wire is made smaller, the wire will be thinner or a less efficient conducting material may be used as a substitute. Step 2: An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - Perturbation effect: A smaller electrical source is produced, which means lower electric current. Step 3: The electrical current flows through the wire - Perturbation effect: With a smaller electrical source, there will be less electrical current flowing through the wire. If the wire is thinner or a less efficient conductor is used, the current flow may be further reduced due to higher resistance. Step 4: The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - Perturbation effect: Since the electrical current is reduced due to the smaller electrical source and possible increased resistance, the strength of the magnetic field generated will be weaker than it would be with the original amount of copper and electrical source. Step 5: The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source - Perturbation effect: This step is not directly affected by the perturbation, as the functionality of turning the magnetic field on and off remains the same. However, due to the weaker magnetic field generated, the overall effect of turning on and off may be less pronounced. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have indirect effects on the process. The decreased availability of copper and subsequent reduction in the electrical source lowers the electric current, resulting in a weaker magnetic field. This ultimately impacts the effectiveness of the magnetization process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.  and the situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  Answer the following question: If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, are they closer or farther? A:","output":"If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, they are farther apart.

Input: My (23/F) boyfriend (26/m) has been extremely busy with work this week. A few times during the year, his job is really high stress and he usually reacts by being distant in our relationship. I understand why, it’s happened before and we’ve talked about it. However, I always worry about him when this happens and he reassures me everything is fine. I think I get on his nerves by always checking in to make sure everything is OK. (Ugh, I know. I’m a worrier, I can’t help it sometimes.)  He has plans with his friends this weekend to blow off some steam and chill out with them. So, I was planning on getting some of his favorite booze delivered to his house as a little gift to maybe cheer him up. (We live in a major city, so booze delivery is super easy and I wouldn’t be physically going over there - I’m trying to give him space and let him do his thing.)  But, I can’t help but think this would be kind of an asshole move. Like I said, he gets distant when he’s in these stressful periods, so I don’t want to encroach on his space and seem like an overbearing girlfriend.  So, am I overthinking this or WIBTA if I got my boyfriend a surprise booze delivery?  Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation. Usage: The author's boyfriend is very busy and stressed with work, causing him to become distant in their relationship. The author wants to send her boyfriend some of his favorite booze as a gift to cheer him up. However, she is unsure if it would be an overbearing action. This example meets the criteria because it involves actions that create considerations of social and personal responsibilities, and create questions of right or wrong in the situation.  Part #2: Classify each post into the category AUTHOR. Usage: In this situation, the author's intentions seem good and she is genuinely concerned about her boyfriend's well-being. While one might argue that she might be a bit overbearing, it's not completely wrong on her part. Therefore, it does not fit into the AUTHOR category, as the author is not clearly in the wrong.  Part #3: Classify each post into the category OTHER. Usage: The boyfriend is busy and stressed with work and might become distant in the relationship because of that. However, this reaction is understandable, and it does not make him wrong in this situation. Thus, the post does not fit into the OTHER category, as the other person is not clearly in the wrong either.  Part #4: Classify each post into the category EVERYBODY. Usage: In this case, both the author and her boyfriend may have areas for improvement, but neither are entirely wrong in their actions or intentions. Therefore, the post cannot be classified as EVERYBODY, as both parties are not clearly wrong in the situation.  Part #5: Classify each post into the category NOBODY. Usage: Since neither the author nor her boyfriend have acted entirely wrong or with ill-intent, the post should be classified as NOBODY. The author shows genuine concern for her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's distant behavior can be attributed to work stress, which affects relationships on occasion.

Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. However, it was not yet able to take Königsberg and retreated soon afterward. Still, it was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men. Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts. Q: What caused the Russians based in Memel to be successful deeper into Prussia?","output":"The success of the Russians based in Memel in advancing deeper into Prussia can be attributed to several factors: 1. Overwhelming numbers: The Russian army invaded Memel with 75,000 troops, which was a considerable force. This large number of troops allowed them to exert pressure on the Prussian defenses. 2. Effective artillery bombardment: The Russian army used a five-day-long artillery bombardment to weaken the defenses of the strong fortress in Memel. This bombardment likely inflicted significant damage and demoralized the defenders, ultimately allowing the Russians to storm and capture the fortress. 3. Taking advantage of the opportunity: After capturing Memel, the Russians used it as a base to launch further attacks into East Prussia. They defeated a smaller Prussian force at the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757, showcasing their tactical prowess and exploiting Prussia's vulnerabilities. 4. Prussian distractions: At the time, Prussia was fighting on multiple fronts, with King Frederick II being forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia and withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. This stretched Prussian resources and made defending against the Russian advance more difficult. In summary, the Russians based in Memel were successful in advancing deeper into Prussia due to their overwhelming numbers, effective artillery bombardment, tactical maneuvering, and taking advantage of the Prussian distractions on multiple fronts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things. a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 171*g - 2599 = 650 for g.. What is the answer??","output":"Alright, let's solve this step by step like we are talking to a five-year-old. We have this problem: 171 times g minus 2599 equals 650. It looks like this:  171 * g - 2599 = 650 First, let's move 2599 to the other side of the equation to make things easier. To do this, we add 2599 to both sides, so it looks like this: 171 * g = 650 + 2599 Now, we add 650 and 2599 together: 171 * g = 3249 Our job now is to find out what number g is. We need to divide both sides of the equation by 171, so it looks like this: g = 3249 ÷ 171 Finally, when we divide 3249 by 171, we get: g = 19 So the answer is g = 19.

Article: Through history, children have played with toys and they help to prepare children for adult life. But the toys are changing all the time. As science and technology have changed the way adults live, the toys children play with have changed as well. Developments in science and technology have had a big effect on the toys that children play with. Today trains and mobile phones are popular toys for young children, but there were no toys of this kind before real trains and mobile phones were invented.  The materials that toys are made of have also changed.  Today lots of toys are made of plastic. Plastic is a modern, man-made material that did not exist   in the past. On the other hand, some other toys that you have might not be all that different from the ones children played with 1,000 years ago. Scientists have found some bone dice  in Aberdeen. In medieval  times dice were used for playing games as much as they are today. A recent survey found that half of all the children aged from 4 to 6 have played video games, a quarter of them regularly. The increasing use of electronic toys troubles Dr Singer, a professor at Yale. \\"One thing we know is that kids in early years need to be in touch with the real world,\\" he said, \\"No matter how brilliant they are, they're not going to learn to walk, to move or to talk to others unless their hands or feet have a direct role in such activities.\\" Some toy experts argue that the best toys are the ones that increase a child's creativity and imagination. Traditional toys can be used for different kinds of purposes and be used in group settings, individually , and one-to-one. They are also used differently depending on the child's age and skill level. And these toys made of natural materials are valuable for children because they teach children what the world is made of.   Question: From the article, we can know that  _  .

Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Falcons flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 7 divisional duel with the New Orleans Saints. Due to QB Joey Harrington's ineffectiveness from last week's loss to the Giants, QB Byron Leftwich was given the start. In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 37-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. The Falcons responded with former Saints kicker Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Atlanta began to play well as Andersen got a 33-yard field goal, while Leftwich completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. In the third quarter, New Orleans retook the lead with RB Pierre Thomas getting a 24-yard TD run. On the Falcons' next possession, Leftwich's left leg got injured during a sack by Saints DE Will Smith. Harrington took over for the rest of the game. In the fourth quarter, Andersen gave Atlanta a 21-yard field goal. The Saints sealed the win with Brees hooking up with RB Reggie Bush on a 4-yard TD pass, along with Bush's 2-point conversion run. With their third-straight loss, the Falcons entered their bye week at 1-6. Answer this question: How many yards longer was the longest field goal in comparison to the shortest field goal?","output":"In this game, the longest field goal was 38 yards by Morten Andersen, and the shortest field goal was 21 yards, also by Andersen. To find out how many yards longer the longest field goal was in comparison to the shortest field goal, we subtract the shorter distance from the longer distance: 38 yards (longest field goal) - 21 yards (shortest field goal) = 17 yards So, the longest field goal was 17 yards longer than the shortest field goal in this game."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of progressivism very much distinct in character from Batman.  - DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher.

Article: As long as you complete the requirements (mostly scientific in nature), you can major in anything you would like. For example, you must take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics to prepare for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and fulfill medical school prerequisites. As a result, many pre-med students major in a field of science. Medical schools are looking to diversify their programs, so they are starting to accept more students with less conventional backgrounds that include degrees in fields such as humanities. As of 2015, you will need the background of one semester of introductory psychology and one semester of introductory sociology to be prepared for the Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section of the MCAT. It is important to have a high GPA in order to be a strong medical school candidate. Whatever major you choose, make your performance in the classroom your main focus.  Be an exemplary student. Attend all of your classes each time they meet, schedule lots of time for reading and studying and do not hesitate to get help from another classmate or a tutor the minute you realize you are struggling with any of your subjects. Focus on BCPM. BCPM stands for \\"Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics\\"; these are the core classes for a pre-med major because these courses are prerequisites for any medical school program. Your BCPM  grades are greatly important that when you apply to medical school, your scores in these classes will be separated out and an additional GPA will be calculated for these classes alone and reviewed along with your cumulative GPA in all of your classes. Do your best to get to know them and learn if they are accessible to offer guidance or answer questions. In a couple of years, you will need letters of evaluation from individuals who know you and your work, and one of your professors might agree to write such a letter if he or she feels they've made a connection with you.  Attend department and informal functions where it might be easier to talk casually and openly with instructors. Look for opportunities to meet alumni who have gone on to medical school or those who are working now as physicians. You can learn a lot about what to expect in medical school by talking to someone who has been there themselves. Plan to get involved in activities both related and unrelated to your major and look for opportunities on and off campus to develop personal, leadership, research, and clinical skills.  Be sure to join any health-career clubs on your campus and get on the mailing list so that you will receive notices about events and activities. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Premed Navigator is a helpful monthly newsletter which features important topics, resources, tips, and key dates for aspiring physicians. Approach the campus health clinic to look for volunteer positions there, and, if your school has a research facility, check for opportunities to assist in some way. Go off campus to explore ways to get involved in the local community health center, at health fairs or teaching children about basic health topics. See if a local public school might be looking for candidates to take to kids about health care careers. There is a world of difference from learning the fundamentals in a classroom and practicing those skills with actual patients. You must find ways to get hands-on experience in a health care setting. Reach out to your local Planned Parenthood office, HIV clinic, or free clinic to volunteer. The author of an article that appeared in U.S. News and World Report said several admissions committee members he spoke to referred to clinical experience as \\"the unspoken requirement.\\" The occasional one-time volunteer job is fine, but you want to choose a couple of organizations or causes about which you are passionate and make a regular (once-a-week or once-every-other-week) commitment over a sustained period of time. Seek out under-served populations. Medical schools are not only looking for students with great grades, they want people who are caring and want to make a difference. Working to provide health care and health education to under-served or at-risk populations can help communicate your compassion. Being a physician means being in charge of a lot--diagnosis, treatment, medications, follow-ups and on and on. Hone your skills as a leader by heading up a group or a committee and be sure to set, achieve and record your goals for your organization. Internships for pre-med students typically fall into one of two categories: research or clinical. Decide what most interests you and focus your efforts there.  Start with your adviser. Your adviser or health-career services office should have a list of internships available. Many times, schools establish relationships with doctors, hospitals, and health care organizations who, in turn, regularly accept student interns from that school. Apply early. The time to be thinking about summer internships is in the fall of the preceding year. At minimum, start three to four months out, but do not be surprised if there are fewer opportunities available. Be proactive. Talk to older students or alumni to find out about internship sites they would recommend or get and review a list of places that offered internships last summer. Contact those organizations on your own before they post or advertise their upcoming internships for the general pre-med population. While you're busy working on your grades, extracurricular activities and internships, you also need to keep in mind about upcoming requirements and deadlines that are a part of the med school applications process.  Get familiar with the AAMC Fee Assistance Program. The AAMC Fee Assistance Program assists those who, without financial assistance, would be unable to take the Medical College Admission Test® (MCAT®), apply to medical schools that use the American Medical College Application Service® (AMCAS®), and more. Learn more about benefits and eligibility here. Take the MCAT junior year. There are two factors to consider when deciding on the timing of your Medical College Admission Test (MCAT): whether you plan to take the exam more than once and how prepared you feel.  If you think you might want to take the test more than once, plan to make your first attempt before May 1. This will give you plenty of time to get your scores and make a decision about retesting. Most people do not plan on taking the exam multiple times, and some argue that it will hurt your chances. Like all things in life: if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right the first time.  If you don't feel prepared academically or there are elements in your personal life that are making it difficult for you to focus, put your efforts into your coursework and on getting in a good place mentally for the test. It would be perfectly fine if you waited until June or July to take the exam. Even people who take the exam in August can apply that cycle.

A confident Mitt Romney has said he feels 'pretty darn good' about his six wins on Super Tuesday, dismissing the narrowness of his Ohio victory over Rick Santorum by insisting he would be the Republican nominee. Appearing on CNBC the morning after he increased his delegate lead and won states from Alaska to Massachusetts with Idaho, Ohio, Virginia and Vermont in between he said he was 'getting the kind of support across the party that I need to become the nominee'. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee while Newt Gingrich claimed his home state of Georgia but the Romney campaign said that it was a virtual impossibility either could win. On the way: Mitt Romney, who claimed at least 212 delegates on Super Tuesday, believes that he is well on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president. 'All we have to do is keep doing what. we're doing and we can get to the nomination,' a senior Romney adviser. said. 'Those guys, it's going to take some sort of act of God to get. where they need to be to win the nomination.' As if to confirm that President Barack. Obama believes Romney will be his opponent in November, the Obama. campaign held a press conference call slamming the former Massachusetts. governor. David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist. said that Romney 'grinds out tactical victories in a kind of death. march' and added: 'We tried to appeal to the best of people, and they. appear to be trying to appeal to the worst in people' Though critics argue that he is having. trouble 'sealing the deal' with voters, Romney advisers argue that the. rules for apportionment of delegates make it certain that he will be the. nominee. Romney said: “We will come together. because Barack Obama has organised a conservative community…the. community organiser has organised us in a big way. 'When we have a nominee we will come together because Barack Obama has organized the conservative community. 'We're going to come together because we really believe that he needs to be replaced.' As well as winning more states and. securing more votes, Romney also amassed a clear majority of the more. than 400 delegates at stake. But proportional Republican rules meant he. was several hundred away from the 1,144 needed for the GOP nomination. In the bag? Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann greet supporters as they arrive at their Super Tuesday primary rally in Boston tonight. He now leads the field with 415 delegates with Santorum on 176, Gingrich on 105 and Ron Paul on 47. Romney's His wafer-thin margin of. victory in Ohio underlined doubts about his candidacy and his ability to. connect with low-income voters. Santorum's wins in North Dakota,. Oklahoma and Tennessee gave his shoestring campaign a boost but his poor. campaign organisation was revealed in his failure to secure more. delegates. Kansas is set to vote on Saturday. followed by two Southern states Alabama and Mississippi, where. evangelicals are suspicious of Romney because of his Mormon faith. Santorum is expected to do well in all three contests. Gingrich's win in Georgia was a lone. bright spot in a dismal night for him. He vowed to continue but will. face pressure to drop out so that Santorum can consolidate the. conservative anti-Romney vote, especially if victory eludes him in. Alabama and Mississippi. He told supporters in Georgia: 'There. are lots of bunny rabbits to run through, I am the tortoise. I just take. one step at a time.' Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas. congressman whose uncompromising anti-war stances have meant he never. had a realistic chance of the nomination, failed to win a single state. He is likely to stay in the race for the long haul but is not viewed as a. threat by Romney. The results underlined Romney's. continued inability to win over large swathes of the Republican base,. who view his past as a moderate Massachusetts governor with suspicion. Fighting spirit: Rick Santorum rallied his supporters on Super Tuesday at the Steubenville High School in Ohio - before he lost the state to Mitt Romney. Early success: Newt Gingrich makes his victory speech in Atlanta with wife Callista after he won the state of Georgia. Confident: Rick Santorum kisses his wife after he won in Tennessee and Oklahoma on Super Tuesday. Speaking to supporters in Boston, Romney acknowledged that he had not landed a knockout blow. He said: 'Tonight, we are counting up. the delegates for the convention – and counting down the days until. November. We're going to take your vote and our victory all the way to. the White House.' Romney and his allies spent almost. four times the money on campaigning in Ohio compared to Santorum, with. much of that on negative advertising. Santorum waited until Oklahoma and Tennessee fell into his column before speaking to cheering supporters in Ohio. Santorum told supporters in. Steubenville, Ohio: 'We're going to get at least a couple of gold medals. and a whole passel full of silver medals. 'We've won in the West, the Midwest, in the South and we're going to win across this country.' Romney is worth more than 200 million and has at times struggled to connect with ordinary people. But he honed his message in Ohio,. saying that the 2012 election centred around 'whether the stresses on. families are going to be alleviated, where you've got a mom working the. day shift and a dad working a night shift and the kids not sure who's. home when'. He unveiled a new slogan of 'more jobs, less debt, smaller government' that was as much aimed at Obama as his Republican rivals. Party elders fear that a prolonged race would leave Romney damaged against Obama in the general election. In Ohio, Santorum charged: 'The. underlying problem that I hear when I talk to people all over, they say. they just don't trust Mitt Romney to not do what's the fashionable thing. at the moment.'

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: General health has improved worldwide, thanks to significant progress against infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria in the past decade and gains in fighting maternal and child illnesses. But healthy life expectancy has not increased as much, so people are living more years with illness and disability, according to the analysis, published in The Lancet journal. “The world has made great progress in health, but now the challenge is to invest in finding more effective ways of preventing or treating the major causes of illness and disability,” said Theo Vos, a professor at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington who led the analysis. The study’s main findings were that global life expectancy at birth for both sexes rose by 6.2 years  — from 65.3 in 1990 to 71.5 in 2013. Healthy life expectancy at birth rose by 5.4 years — from 56.9 in 1990 to 62.3 in 2013. Healthy life expectancy takes into account both mortality and the impact of non-fatal conditions and chronic illnesses like heart and lung diseases, diabetes and serious injuries. Those detract from quality of life and impose heavy cost and resources burdens. For most of the 188 countries studied, changes in healthy life expectancy between 1990 and 2013 were “significant and positive”, the researchers said. But in many - among them Belize, Botswana and Syria - healthy life expectancy in 2013 was not much higher than in 1990. And in some, including South Africa, Paraguay, and Belarus, healthy life expectancy has dropped. In Lesotho and Swaziland, people born in 2013 could expect to live some 10 fewer healthy years than people born there 20 years earlier. The study also found stark differences between countries with the highest and lowest healthy life expectancies, and in the rates and direction of change. Nicaraguans and Cambodians have seen dramatic increases since 1990, of 14.7 and 13.9 years respectively. People in Botswana and Belize, however, saw declines of two and 1.3 years respectively. In 2013, Lesotho had the world’s lowest healthy life expectancy, at 42 years. Japan had the highest, at 73.4 years.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Percy Robert Miller was born and raised in New Orleans in the Calliope Projects. He is the oldest out of five children. He has one sister, Germaine, and three brothers: Kevin, and platinum-selling rap artists Corey \\"C-Murder\\" & Vyshonne \\"Silkk The Shocker\\" Miller. He attended Booker T. Washington High School & Warren Easton High School. Since 1997, Master P has been in numerous feature and straight to DVD films, and in television shows. His filmography includes Uncle P, Uncle Willy's Family, Soccer Mom, Gone in 60 Seconds, Toxic, Foolish, and I Got the Hook Up. In 1999, he had a small run in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he led a professional wrestling stable called The No Limit Soldiers in a feud with Curt Hennig's The West Texas Rednecks. Master P also starred in Romeo! alongside his son Romeo Miller on the children's network Nickelodeon from 2003 to 2006. He was also a contestant on Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 2), replacing Romeo who dropped out due to an injury. He partnered with Ashly DelGrosso and received a total score of 8 out of 30 for his pasodoble, the lowest score in the show's history. He was eliminated on Week 4.  In 2008, Miller has also made history as the first hip-hop entrepreneur to own a cable television network, Better Black Television (or BBTV011, which was meant to promote positive messages and content to the African American culture). The network was launched in 2009. Executives include Denzel Washington, Derek Anderson of the Charlotte Bobcats, DJ Kool Herc, and Bo Derek. As part of the BBTV project, Miller and Romeo teamed up to develop a children's cartoon titled 'Gee Gee The Giraffe. The show is true to the duo's mission to produce positive, educational, and entertaining content for African-American children. Animation has been employed by the Millers on prior occasions such as their February 2008 cartoon version of their music video for the song \\"Black History.\\"  As reported in March 2011, Miller planned to star in a new film with his protege Gucci Mane, titled Get Money. The film, set for release through No Limit, would be based on Miller's book of the same name.  On June 10, 2015, it was announced that Master P and his family, would be starring in their own reality show titled Master P's Family Empire.

It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

Translate to Finnish: Globalisation is here to stay and international competition is becoming increasingly tough.","output":"Globalisaatio on tullut jäädäkseen, ja kansainvälinen kilpailu muuttuu yhä kovemmaksi. Globalisaatio tarkoittaa maailmanlaajuista taloudellista, teknologista, sosiaalista ja kulttuurista yhdentymistä. Se on prosessi, jonka ansiosta eri maiden rajat ylittävät toimijat voivat toimia yhä tiiviimmin ja helpommin yhdessä. Tämä johtaa maiden keskinäiseen vuorovaikutukseen ja kohtalaisen yhteisen maailmankäsityksen kehittymiseen. Globalisaatio on prosessina ollut käynnissä jo vuosisatojen ajan, mutta sen nopeus, laajuus ja syvyys ovat lisääntyneet huomattavasti viime vuosikymmeninä. Tähän on vaikuttanut monia tekijöitä, kuten teknologian kehitys, lisääntyvä politiikkojen vapauttaminen, uusliberalistisen talouspolitiikan nousu, pääoman kansainvälistyminen ja kulttuurin leviämisen helpottuminen. Kansainvälinen kilpailu on myös muuttunut yhä kovemmaksi globalisaation seurauksena. Tämä johtuu osittain siitä, että uudet taloudelliset suurvallat, kuten Kiina ja Intia, ovat nousseet haastamaan perinteisiä länsimaita, ja yritykset joutuvat kilpailemaan yhä rajummin keskenään kansainvälisillä markkinoilla. Samalla kansainvälisten sopimusten ja järjestöjen merkitys on kasvanut, ja niiden kautta valtioiden välinen kilpailu on tullut helpommin arvioitavaksi. Vaikka globalisaatio on monin tavoin hyvä asia, se on myös synnyttänyt useita haasteita ja ongelmia. Esimerkkeinä näistä ovat eriarvoisuuden lisääntyminen, ympäristöongelmien laajeneminen, kulttuurien välisten ristiriitojen kärjistyminen ja kansalaisten kokema turvattomuuden tunne. Siksi on tärkeää, että niin yksittäiset maat kuin kansainväliset toimijatkin pyrkivät puuttumaan näihin haasteisiin ja tekemään yhteistyötä kestävän kehityksen ja paremman tulevaisuuden luomiseksi. Lopuksi voidaan todeta, että globalisaatio on nykymaailman todellisuus, joka vaikuttaa yhä enemmän kaikkiin elämän osa-alueisiin. Kansainvälisen kilpailun kiristyminen on yksi tämän prosessin seurauksista, ja siitä selviäminen vaatii sekä tehokasta, innovatiivista toimintaa että yhteistyöhakuisuutta kaikkien toimijoiden kesken. On tärkeää, että ihmiset ja instituutiot sopeutuvat tähän muuttuvaan todellisuuteen ja etsivät tapoja hyödyntää sen tuomia mahdollisuuksia samalla takuulla välttäen sen aiheuttamia uhkia ja riskejä."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, you should avoid posting your location. Online predators look for this type of information, and you don't want them showing up at your social event. Don't use the “check-in” tool on sites like Facebook or Yelp. Keep your personal details secure. Don't post things like your full name, phone number, e-mail address, or physical address. This will make it much harder for any creeps to track you down.  When you are filling out an online profile, don't feel like you have to complete all fields. Just fill in the parts that you feel comfortable sharing. Use a different screen name. Instead of your actual name, consider using a nickname or pseudonym. You could be “CubsFan29” or “Katie B.” Online predators are great at being sneaky. Today, we're pretty dependent on technology, and a lot of your data is probably digital. In order to keep your information secure, invest in an anti-virus software for your computer. Make sure to use complicated passwords and update them regularly for more protection. Of course it's nice to know that your family is proud of you. But make sure that mom or dad aren't posting a lot of details every time you get a promotion or buy a home. Gently say something like, “I love how enthusiastic you are. But could you not post personal stuff about me online? I try to keep a low profile.” Check in on your loved ones' posts regularly. It's a good idea to keep an eye on any posts that involve you. Summary:","output":"Maintaining online safety and privacy is of paramount importance, especially considering the rise of online predators and data breaches recently. This involves implementing several strategies. Firstly, avoid posting your current location on social media platforms to avoid unsolicited individuals from knowing where you are. In addition, don't use the “check-in” feature on sites such as Facebook or Yelp.  Secondly, never share personal information such as your full name, phone number, email address, or physical address. This protects from making it easy for potential predators to track you down.  When setting up online profiles, it's not mandatory to complete every field. Only fill in what you are comfortable with sharing publicly. Furthermore, consider using a pseudonym or a nickname as your screen name instead of your real name. This not only protects your true identity but also makes it difficult for potential predators. Investing in good anti-virus software is also a crucial step towards safeguarding information present on your device. Use strong, unique passwords and make it a habit of regularly updating them to further enhance your online security.  Family members, especially parents, are usually excited to share your accomplishments online but it's necessary to have a dialogue with them regarding what can and can't be posted. Kindly request them not to put personal information or events online.  Lastly, regularly monitor any posts or contents involving you made by your loved ones and maintain a check on what is going public that might contain information about you.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed.

When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race.

A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the \\"man behind the curtain\\" is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). Like the second entry in the series, I wished Paul Greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there. With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the \\"Identity\\" and the \\"Supremacy\\", this \\"Ultimatum\\" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it. Choose your answer.

(Associated Press)      Results come in at the watch party for Republican candidate for governor Sam Galeotos at his residence on Tuesday, Aug. 21, 2018, in rural Laramie County, Wyo. (Jacob Byk/The Wyoming Tribune Eagle via AP) (Associated Press)      CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — President Donald Trump tried his best to appeal to coal country but, amid a truckload of bad political news, the top coal-producing state didn't love him back.      Instead, Wyoming voters chose Secretary of State Mark Gordon, a rancher who grew up at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains, over political mega-donor Foster Friess in the state's Republican primary for governor. Calling Friess \\"Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment,\\" Trump had endorsed Friess on Twitter as voting got underway Tuesday.      Trump hours later walked back Obama-era environmental regulations viewed as economic warfare in coal country and told a West Virginia rally that miners were headed back to work. About 40 percent of the nation's coal comes from Wyoming — Trump no doubt got heard out West.      Wyoming voters had their own ideas.      \\"This is a governor's race. This is about the state of Wyoming,\\" Gordon said after winning his six-way primary. \\"President Trump is doing great things that are important for Wyoming in terms of getting our economy going, and all of that. But in the end, I think people in Wyoming concentrated on who's got the experience, who's got the record and who's got the best message going forward for Wyoming.\\"      Trump won Wyoming by the widest margin in 2016, but his support here may be seen as a mile wide and an inch deep. After all, Wyoming Republicans by far preferred another candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination that year.      Wyoming could even choose a Democrat again. Attorney and former state Rep. Mary Throne, who was raised on a ranch not far from Gordon's and beat three others to win the Democratic nomination for governor, will be a formidable opponent, Gordon said.      \\"Traditionally in Wyoming, we focus on the person and not the party when it comes to electing our governors. And that we like our governors to be independent and thoughtful and all about Wyoming,\\" Throne said Tuesday.      The winner will succeed term-limited Gov. Matt Mead. Like Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who served two terms before Mead and then on St. Louis-based Arch Coal's board of directors, Throne describes herself as pro-coal. There's no good reason to doubt it.      Throne grew up in Campbell County, home to some of the world's biggest open-pit coal mines.      While Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and attorney Michael Cohen were convicted of felonies Friday, the president did pick a winner in Wyoming. Trump endorsed Sen. John Barrasso over a wealthy opponent, Jackson Hole business investor Dave Dodson.      Delayed by thunderstorms, Barrasso barely made it back to Wyoming from Washington, D.C., in time to hear he'd won the Republican primary. Busy traveling, Barrasso said he had read little about the news involving Trump's associates. He declined comment on how Trump's political and potentially legal fortunes could affect his work with the White House.      \\"I go to work every day thinking about the people of Wyoming. Every day I wake up I think about Wyoming, jobs, the economy, how we can make life better for the people of Wyoming. I think that the voters saw that,\\" Barrasso said.      Barrasso faces Wilson businessman Gary Trauner in the general election. Trauner, who ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination, ran for the U.S. House twice and came within half a point of beating Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin in 2006.      Incumbent Liz Cheney easily won the Republican nomination for Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat.      Cheney beat two other Republicans, Blake Stanley of Cheyenne and Rod Miller of Buford. Stanley and Miller both characterized themselves as blue-collar conservatives and ran low-key campaigns.      Cheney will run against Laramie businessman Greg Hunter, who beat attorney Travis Helm for the Democratic nomination for U.S. House.      ___      Follow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver ||||| To the incredible people of the Great State of Wyoming: Go VOTE TODAY for Foster Friess - He will be a fantastic Governor!

A very impressive staging of suspense and action, whichbegins within the first 20 pages.Granted, the ending is too shortand a little anti-climactic, but realistic from a logical point of view.There was a nice exploration of the characteristics of Ticktock's powers, including the Pause.

The people working at those jobs will earn about 50,000 each. Hypothesis (an idea we want to check): The government actually gave less money (only 20,000 for each job) to the shipyard.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does the visitor attempt to take after the knitting woman?, using the article: Brink has recently taken Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in an auto wreck.  Brink later comes for Gramps. Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if Gramps touches Mr. Brink or the apple tree. Demetria plots to have Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans, can not even kill a fly they have captured.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let us first analyze the statements provided. Premise: \\"No, there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal\\" The premise given asserts that there is an absence of a feeling of accomplishment and that there is no goal present. This can be interpreted as implying a situation where the individual(s) involved did not experience a sense of achievement or success, and there was no specific objective to be attained. Hypothesis: \\"There was a huge sense of accomplishment\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents a contrasting scenario. It asserts that there is a significant feeling of accomplishment. This statement implies a situation where the individual(s) involved experienced a major sense of success, satisfaction, or triumph. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Entailment is the relationship between two sentences or statements when one logically follows or can be deduced from the other. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be necessarily true. There should be no contradiction between the two. In this case, the premise states that there was no feeling of accomplishment and no goal, whereas, the hypothesis posits that there was a huge sense of accomplishment. These statements are contradictory and express opposite scenarios. The premise implies the absence of accomplishment, while the hypothesis suggests the presence of significant accomplishment. Therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise and hypothesis present conflicting scenarios, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee or necessitate the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His body was found in hospital grounds 10 weeks later, less than 40 metres away. Mr Fenton's grandfather said he climbed a fence to search an area that police officers had not searched. The coroner asked a police superintendent who was giving evidence how trained Tactical Support Group officers failed to carry out a successful search in that area on the same day. The officer observed that a controversial decision had been made to search to \\"a natural boundary\\". Earlier, the superintendent told the inquest the PSNI had changed its policy and practices on missing persons, as a direct result of the case. In 2013 the Police Ombudsman issued a report critical of the way the police had handled the case, and 12 officers were subsequently disciplined. During his evidence, the officer issued an apology to the Fenton family for the way the police had handled the search for James. The inquest also heard on Thursday from an expert in psychiatry that he had concerns about James' care. Giving evidence by video link, Professor Seena Fazel, a forensic psychiatrist at Oxford University, repeated the views of a report he wrote for the Coroner's Office in March 2015, and stated that he had \\"a number of concerns about Mr Fenton's medical care\\". In it, he said he believed that James was likely to  have been clinically depressed, that he should have been diagnosed as such on assessment at the ward, and that he should have been monitored more closely. \\"I do not think that placing Mr Fenton on routine observation was an appropriate decision,\\" he said. He also repeated his belief that James most likely took his own life. He further stated he felt that the junior doctor who first assessed Mr Fenton should have discussed her findings and actions formally with senior psychiatric colleagues. She has previously told the court she did have an informal conversation with senior colleagues about what she had done. On Wednesday, two other senior consultant psychiatrists told the court they disagreed with Professor Fazel's conclusions. They were Dr Nial Quigley, the Director of Mental Health services at the South Eastern Trust, and Dr Neta Chada, a consultant psychiatrist at the neighbouring Southern Trust. Both doctors' evidence supported the diagnosis and level of observation chosen by the clinical staff at the Ulster Hospital. Professor Fazel told a barrister for the Fenton family that in one matter, Dr Quigley had \\"cherry-picked a lot of evidence that supported his view\\". Coroner Joe McCriskin is due to deliver his findings on Friday. A summary of the above article is?","output":"A young man named James Fenton, who was 22 years old, left his hospital ward in 2010. Ten weeks later, his body was found close to the hospital. People are trying to understand how this happened and if the police and the hospital could have done more to help James. Some experts think that James was very sad, and the hospital should have taken better care of him. The police also apologized to James' family for not finding him sooner.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What channel is the television turned to when they wake up? Movie title: Dude, Where's My Car? Movie plot: Jesse and Chester awaken with hangovers and no memory of the previous night. The television is on, showing an Animal Planet program about how animals use twigs and rocks as tools to get food. Their refrigerator is filled with containers of chocolate pudding, and the answering machine contains an angry message from their twin girlfriends Wilma and Wanda as to their whereabouts. They emerge from their home to find Jesse's car missing, and with it their girlfriends' one-year anniversary presents. This prompts Jesse to ask the film's titular question: \\"Dude, where's my car?\\" Because the girls have promised them a \\"special treat\\", which Jesse and Chester take to mean sex, the men are desperate to retrieve their car. The duo begins retracing their steps in an attempt to discover where they left the car. Along the way, they encounter a transgender stripper, a belligerent speaker box operator at a Chinese restaurant's drive-through, discover two appropriately-worded tattoos on each other's backs, run into UFO cultists led by Zoltan, a Cantonese-speaking Chinese tailor, the Zen-minded Nelson and his cannabis-loving dog, the aggressive jock Tommy and his friends, a couple of hard-nosed police detectives, and a reclusive French ostrich farmer. They also meet two groups of aliens, one group being five gorgeous women, the other being two Norwegian men, searching for the \\"Continuum Transfunctioner\\"; a mysterious and powerful device, capable of destroying the universe, that the boys accidentally picked up last night. In an arcade, they discover that the Continuum Transfunctioner was a Rubik's Cube that Chester has been working hard to solve, and eventually does (thus activating it). They are warned that once the five lights stop flashing, the universe will be destroyed. Jesse and Chester must determine which of two sets of aliens is entitled to the device. One of the groups is there to protect the universe, the other is there to destroy it. Both claim to be the protectors of the universe, stating that they were with Jesse... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\", when Jesse and Chester wake up with hangovers and no memory of the previous night, the television is turned to an Animal Planet channel. The program they see on the screen is focused on how animals use twigs and rocks as tools to get food. As for your decision to invest in this film proposal, there are several factors to consider. First, you should evaluate the target audience and market for the type of comedy presented in this film. \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" is a comedy targeted primarily at a younger demographic, with its absurd humor and exaggerated situations. Secondly, assess the potential for commercial success based on similar films and their box office performance. For instance, this film falls into the genre of stoner comedy and has a somewhat cult following. Stoner comedies can be moderately successful, such as \\"Half Baked\\" (1998) or the \\"Harold & Kumar\\" series (2004-2011). However, they may not necessarily be the high-grossing powerhouse that mainstream comedies or action films can be. Keep in mind that the market demand for this type of movie may have changed since the early 2000s. Next, consider the cast and creative team involved in the project. For example, \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" starred Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott, both of whom were well-known in comedy roles at the time. The involvement of recognizable or talented actors can contribute to a film's success and help draw audiences in. Lastly, weigh the risks and potential rewards associated with investing in a film. The film industry can be unpredictable, but it's essential to strike a balance between potential financial gains and the risks involved. Before committing to any investment in this project, take into account the budget, production quality, marketing strategy, and distribution plan to ensure you are making an informed decision. Overall, it's crucial to thoroughly consider these factors and conduct a thorough analysis of the film proposal before deciding if it's worth investing in. With a better understanding of the various aspects of the movie industry and this particular film, you'll be able to make an informed decision regarding your potential investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the hypothesis, \\"it\\" refers to the same subject, but this time in its absence. Step 2: Consider the logical connections The premise is saying that \\"it\\" is an excellent resource or factor for progress. The hypothesis claims that without \\"it,\\" the country would face regression. We can notice here that the hypothesis is built on an assumption of the inverse of the premise. Step 3: Analyze the consequence of the premise When we assume the premise to be true, we consider that \\"it\\" will help the country make progress.

Similar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task. What has not been reached as far as defining comics is concerned?","output":"In the field of comic studies, several aspects of defining comics have still not reached consensus, mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of the medium. These aspects include the following: 1. Combination of Text and Images: Early theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove point towards the combination of text and images as a defining feature of comics. However, the existence of pantomime comics, which rely solely on images without any accompanying text, invalidates this theory. Thus, it is still unclear whether a combination of text and images is a necessary attribute for a work to be considered a comic. 2. Primacy of Sequences of Images: Critics like Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud have argued for the primacy of sequences of images, emphasizing the idea that it's the sequencing of images that has significance in defining comics, rather than the use of text. However, this definition can be problematic as it doesn't take into account many comics that heavily rely on text to drive narration and those that may break traditional sequence structures. 3. Cultural Perspectives and New Forms: Given the fact that in the recent past, different cultures have discovered each other's comic traditions and have also rediscovered forgotten forms of early comics, defining the term \\"comics\\" has become even more complex. The introduction of digital comics and graphic novels, for example, has broadened the spectrum of what could be classified as a comic, further complicating the task of defining the medium. 4. The Role of Time: Comics often represent the progression of time across panels, and yet, there isn't a unanimous agreement among theorists on how this element factors into the definition of comics. Some argue it's a crucial attribute, others believe it's merely a byproduct of linear storytelling. In summary, the key factors that still lack consensus when defining comics include the role and necessity of text, the sequencing of images, the cultural and historical evolution of the medium, and the representation and passage of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall)âare the enigma that fill the boys' conversations and dreams. The film opens in the summer with the suicide attempt of the youngest sister, Cecilia, as she slits her wrist in a bath. After her parents allow her to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make her feel better, Cecilia excuses herself and jumps out of her second story bedroom window, dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens air of mystery about the girls to the neighborhood boys in particular. At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the school heartthrob. Trip comes over one night to the Lisbon residence in hopes of getting closer to Lux and watches television with the family.

After winning Homecoming king and queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch the group and have sex on the school's football field.

Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, pictured today, who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder. A man who got into the Olympic Stadium without a ticket then threw a beer bottle at competitors lining up for the men's 100m final has been found guilty of public disorder. Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, hurled abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt then threw a plastic beer bottle on to the track before the race on August 5. Gill-Webb, from South Milford, near Leeds, was today found guilty at Stratford Magistrates' Court, east London, of public disorder. Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting: 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an a***hole,' Stratford Magistrates' Court heard last week. He then threw the plastic beer bottle as the race - which Bolt won in 9.63 seconds - started on August 5 last year. The 34-year-old was confronted by Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch, then escorted from the stadium and arrested. The court heard that he used an old ticket to get into the Olympic Park, and then the stadium. Police never found a ticket on him. Gill-Webb was suffering from a manic episode at the time, with an urge to be 'involved' in the Olympics, the court heard. His lawyers argued that his mental state meant he could not have intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress, but the Crown said that, although he was unwell, he knew what he was doing. The court heard that Gill-Webb pushed his way to the front of the exclusive seating area after getting into the stadium. Prosecutor Neil King described him. mingling with members of the Dutch Olympic team, but his 'shouting and. jostling', then throwing the bottle, led to a confrontation with. Ms Bosch. In a statement, she described how he pushed past her to get to the front of the seating. Scroll down to watch. Foolish: The bottle can be seen landing on the track yards from Usain Bolt, far left, after being thrown by Gill-Webb, circled top. Disorder: Gill-Webb threw the bottle, which can be seen bottom centre of this image, onto the track at the start of the Men's 100m Final. 'He was shouting specifically at Usain Bolt. Things like 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an arsehole',' she said. 'He repeated these taunts over and over - it went on and on for about two minutes.' She saw Gill-Webb move his arm behind his head, then forwards in a throwing motion, then saw the bottle hit the track, she said. Ms Bosch confronted him, saying 'Dude, are you crazy?' 'He was trying to walk away so I pushed him hard to stop him,' she said. 'I was angry with what he had done, which was so disrespectful.' Restrained: Gill-Webb is pictured being detained by security after he threw a bottle onto the track just before the men's 100-metre final at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Abusive: Gill-Webb, who suffers from bipolar affective disorder, pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area at the stadium and started shouting at Usain Bolt. Other witnesses saw Gill-Webb shouting at finalists including Bolt, fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake, and US sprinter Justin Gatlin. Student Farzin Mirshahi heard him yell: 'Believe in Blake, no Usain' while her brother, Kiya Mirshahi, heard: 'Usain, no, Justin, you are a druggie, believe in Blake, no Usain, no.' After the incident, Gill-Webb - who the court heard has since lost his job - was escorted from the stadium and then arrested. His behaviour in police custody was said to be 'somewhat unusual', and he told officers that he was Scottish actor Alan Cumming, signing a statement with the star's name. Gill-Webb, who did not give evidence during his trial, originally denied throwing the bottle, but his DNA was later found on it. He later said he could not remember the incident. Guilty: Ashley Gill-Webb, left, is pictured leaving the court earlier in his trial. Champion: Despite the bottle and the abuse he suffered, Jamaica's Usain Bolt still went on to win the 100m final. Summing up his case, prosecutor Neil King said video footage showed Gill-Webb looking left and right, 'shuffling' behind other people, then surreptitiously throwing the bottle, suggesting he knew what he was doing was wrong, and clearly had intent. But Rhiannon Crimmins, defending, said Gill-Webb was mentally ill at the time and the video just showed a man behaving 'oddly'. Finding Gill-Webb guilty of both charges, District Judge William Ashworth said today: 'The video, in my view, clearly shows Mr Gill-Webb checking to see if he is under observation before taking the risk of throwing the bottle. 'I am sure that he was at that point weighing up the chances of being caught.' He said Gill-Webb's actions were 'rational and wrong' and intended to cause harassment, alarm and distress. Gill-Webb is due to be sentenced next month. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

'Don't judge me': Verna McClain, 30, has spoken out from jail for the first time. She is accused of shooting dead a new mother and snatching her three-day-old child to raise as her own. 'I'm nothing like what these people are making me out to be. I’m the same person everybody knows and loves.' Speaking to KHOU from behind a glass partition, she said: 'Don’t sit and look at me as if I’m some sort of monster. I’m not. Until you know the facts, don’t sit and judge.' She added: 'Right now, I’m so paranoid I don’t know who to trust. Mentally, I’m borderline.' McClain has been charged with the first degree murder of Kala Golden Schuchardt. She is alleged to have shot the 28-year-old mother-of-two and snatched her three-day-old baby Keegan as they left a doctor's office in Spring, Texas.

McClain's sister also told authorities she had told her she was planning to adopt. She added that once. McClain had snatched Keegan, she said she had the baby and needed 'to do. the adoption'.

The Lions at that time had never beaten the Redskins in Washington, D.C. Though the first quarter was scoreless, the Redskins began what would be a 14-play 80-yard drive in the second quarter that finished with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Jason Campbell to Chris Cooley. The Redskins' next possession began at their own 17-yard line: in summary, an 83-yard drive in 7 plays, culminating in a touchdown for Mike Sellers in a 1-yard rushing play. The first half ended with the Redskins up, 14-0. With 2:27 left in the third quarter, the Lions scored their first and only points with a 39-yard field goal to bring the score to 14-3. The Redskins' next drive was only 9 yards and resulted in a  punt, but put the Lions on their own 8-yard line. After a rushing play that resulted in a loss of 1 yard, the Redskins sacked Lions' quarterback Jon Kitna in the end zone for a safety, increasing the Redskins' lead to 13 with a score of 16-3 to end the third quarter. After a fourth-quarter fumble by Redskins' running back Clinton Portis, the Lions took possession at their own 10-yard line. The Lions drove 26 yards before punting to James Thrash, who returned the punt for 62 yards and fumbled towards the end zone, where Rock Cartwright recovered the ball on the 3-yard line. After a Redskins' five-yard penalty, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Mike Sellers and then converted a two-point attempt with a pass to Chris Cooley bringing the score to 24-3. Detroit's next possession ended with an interception by safety Sean Taylor for a 35-yard return which would later help the Redskins finish a drive with a field goal. With less than 3 minutes in the fourth quarter, the Lions began a drive at their own 43-yard line.

Q:Information:  - Reinhard Haupenthal ( born February 17 , 1945 ) is a German Esperantist , Volapükist ( or Volapükologist ) , translator , and linguist . Donald J. Harlow described Haupenthal 's personal style in a warning to potential readers of Haupenthal 's translation of Goethe 's Young Werther : \`\` the vocabulary used by Haupenthal is far from standard , and at times the Esperanto verges on the incomprehensible . ''  - An Esperantist is a person who speaks or uses Esperanto. If its meaning corresponded with its full etymology, an Esperantist would be someone who supports or specializes in those who hope (from Esperanto \\"esperanto\\" \\"a hoping one\\", \\"someone who hopes\\", from \\"esperi\\" \\"to hope\\"). Although definitions of \\"Esperantist\\" vary, according to the Declaration of Boulogne (\\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of esperantism), a document agreed at the first World Congress of Esperanto, an Esperantist is someone who speaks Esperanto and uses it for any purpose. An Esperantist is also a person who participates in Esperanto culture.  - The Declaration of Boulogne (full name: \\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of Esperantism) was a document written by L. L. Zamenhof and endorsed by the attendees of the first World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France in 1905. It defined \\"Esperantism\\" as a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to natural languages in international and inter-ethnic contexts, not as a substitute for them within their proper realm. It declared that the Esperanto movement as such is politically and religiously neutral. It noted that Esperanto is in the public domain and anyone can use it however they like, as the creator of the language resigned his rights to it at the beginning. It said that the only obligatory authority for Esperanto speakers is the \\"Fundamento de Esperanto\\" (a collection of the early grammar, dictionary and sample text documents), which all speakers of the language are recommended to imitate for the sake of stability in the language.   - A volapükologist is a person whose scientific interest is Volapük or who learns the language for hobby reasons.  - Volapük (in English; in Volapük) is a constructed language, created in 18791880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany. Schleyer felt that God had told him in a dream to create an international language. Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents. Volapük was largely displaced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Esperanto.

Please write a short summary for the following article: How the Yankees gambled big on most glaring weakness The Yankees offseason checklist looked something like this: 1. Find a shortstop – priority one. 5. Avoid further risky, long-term investment. 6. Protect the best of the farm system and add to it when possible. 7. Create roster depth and flexibility. 8. Put safety nets in place for the rotation. The Yankees accomplished seven of the eight objectives – everything but creating a better security blanket for their fragile rotation. Yet, even while checking off so many items on their list, the success of the Yankees’ offseason is, at best, to be determined. This is partly because there might have been no more vital requirement for 2015 success than finding better depth for a rotation in which Masahiro Tanaka, CC Sabathia and Michael Pineda would more fittingly wear red flags than pinstripes. And also because there is so much mystery about what they can expect from nearly every corner of their roster. Here are five thoughts on the Yankees offseason to date: Didi Gregorius at his offseason home in CuracaoPhoto: Berber van Beek / Barcroft USA 1. The Steinbrenner Yankees playbook essentially had been to acquire famous names who have played their five best seasons and hope they don’t fade. In Didi Gregorius and Nathan Eovaldi, the Yankees are trying the opposite approach. Both turn 25 later this month. The Yankees’ hope is they have served their major league apprenticeships, gotten most of the growing pains out of the way and are about to enjoy their five best seasons. That Gregorius can find enough offense to make keeping his glove in the daily lineup easier. That Eovaldi has learned that throwing harder in every crisis is a faulty strategy. The way these two players go ultimately will determine where on the A-to-F grading system this Yankees offseason falls. 2. Aaron Judge and Ian Clarkin are why the Yankees no longer have David Robertson. The Yankees front office adored Robertson, but on a scouting level had him on somewhat equal footing with Andrew Miller. All things being equal, the Yankees probably would have stuck with the player they knew best (Robertson). David Robertson joins the White Sox bullpen.Photo: AP But in the organization’s mind, all things were not equal. Robertson rejected the team’s qualifying offer, which meant the Yankees would get a compensation pick between the first and second round of the draft when he signed elsewhere. Two drafts ago, after Rafael Soriano and Nick Swisher signed elsewhere, they used picks 32-33 overall to take Judge and Clarkin, who are now two of their best prospects — and in the case of Judge, one of the game’s better prospects. Miller plus that pick was more attractive to the Yankees than Robertson. 3. Last July, the Red Sox released Chris Capuano and essentially gave Stephen Drew away in a trade to the Yankees. Capuano was fine as a Yankee, Drew was not, yet the Yankees gave both 5 million to try again. You wonder if either makes it through July 2015 as a Yankee. Both are miscast. Capuano is best utilized as a swingman, but is one of the Yankees’ five starters. Drew is a shortstop playing second. Maybe Capuano is simply a bridge to when (if?) Luis Severino is ready for promotion or when (if?) Ivan Nova is back after Tommy John surgery. But with so much uncertainty in the rotation, Capuano is not the only one who might need to be rescued. Drew went from a .777 OPS championship shortstop in 2013 to a .536 OPS abomination last year. Was 2014 about his disjointed season or has he fallen and can’t get up? 4. Besides Capuano and Drew, the Yankees re-enlisted Chase Headley and Chris Young after both played far better for them than they did with the Padres and Mets, respectively. Were those small-sample size aberrations or signs the Yankees have a quality starting third baseman and a valuable fourth outfielder? The latter is particularly important given Carlos Beltran’s iffy health. 5. The Yankees’ offseason has left them good enough to finish first in the AL East or bad enough to finish fifth. You know who else we can say that about? Every other team in the division. The Red Sox (Hanley Ramirez/Pablo Sandoval) and Blue Jays (Josh Donaldson/Russ Martin) both upgraded their lineups but remain without true aces (maybe without even legitimate No. 2 starters). The Orioles get Manny Machado and Matt Wieters back from injury, but they lost Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis and had the discomfort of their general manager, Dan Duquette, looking for an exit strategy to become Toronto’s team president. The Rays retained the strongest rotation in the division, but dealt Ben Zobrist and Wil Myers to gamble on Asdrubal Cabrera still being able to play shortstop and Steven Souza being ready to hit in the majors. So what kind of offseason did the Yankees have? Everything is by comparison, so the answer could be: How did the rest of the division do this winter? Summary:","output":"The New York Yankees had a busy offseason, focusing on improving their roster and addressing weaknesses. However, despite accomplishing seven of the eight objectives they set out for themselves, the success of the Yankees' offseason still remains to be determined, largely due to the uncertainty in their rotation. The performance of newcomers Didi Gregorius and Nathan Eovaldi, as well as decisions made regarding player investments, will play a key role in the Yankees' direction going forward. The team's uncertain roster situation leaves them in a position where they could potentially finish first or last in the AL East, with other teams in the division facing similar uncertainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  Question: \\"The main country that influenced Japan in the region\\" Answer: \\"Chinese\\" Is this answer correct? OPT: 1). no. 2). yes....I think the answer is","output":"2). yes. The answer is indeed correct. China has been the main country that influenced Japan in the region, especially during the sixth to eighth centuries. Chinese culture, including Buddhism, was introduced to Japanese society through numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists who traveled to China to study various aspects of its civilization. Through figures like Prince Shotoku and the establishment of relations with the Sui dynasty, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, bureaucracy, and even adopted the Chinese calendar for calculating Japan's foundation. Additionally, as mentioned in the description, the Chinese influences permeated into Japanese religion, history, music, literature, and painting, allowing for further development and adaptation within Japan. Thus, it is clear that China played a significant role in shaping the early history and culture of Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: I referenced this in my answer to Why do guys pretend they don't understand when the girl they like gives them all hints of liking them too? While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening. Question: Why did the girl want to kiss?

The path to the semi-finals saw England finishing second in Group G, after winning two of their three group-stage matches: 1. England 2-1 Tunisia on June 18, 2018 2. England 6-1 Panama on June 24, 2018 3. England 0-1 Belgium on June 28, 2018 In the Round of 16, England played against Colombia on July 3, 2018. The match ended in a 1-1 draw after extra time, but England emerged victorious (4-3) in a penalty shootout, breaking their long-standing curse of losing in penalty shootouts in major tournaments. In the quarter-finals, England faced Sweden on July 7, 2018, and secured a comfortable 2-0 victory, advancing to the semi-finals. The semi-final match took place on July 11, 2018, in Moscow, where England faced Croatia. England initially took the lead with an early goal scored by Kieran Trippier. However, Croatia managed to equalize in the second half with a goal from Ivan Perišić and ultimately won 2-1 after a goal was scored by Mario Mandžukić during extra time. This result brought England's journey to an end, and they subsequently lost the third-place play-off game against Belgium (2-0) on July 14, 2018, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.

Samuel struggled, trying to keep up with Brett's seemingly natural ability to disconnect and move on. For as long as they had been friends, Samuel was known to easily form and cultivate strong emotional ties with people. This characteristic of Samuel's seemed to be the opposing force to Brett's self-sufficient nature. As Samuel tried to understand and cope with the distance that Brett could easily place between them, he began to question what made Brett so different. Was it something inherent in his personality, or had he simply learned to adapt that way over time? Deep down, Samuel knew he had to accept and appreciate his own strengths and weaknesses, even if it meant coming to terms with the differences between him and his best friend.

Context: In 1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of \\"State Sponsors of Terrorism\\", while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.

Title: Some good-looking folds, but incomprehensible instructions. Review: I've been into napkin-folding for over 35 years, since first encountering some brief folds in the Vincent & Mary Price Cookbook, \\"Treasury of Great Recipes.\\" While I find at least a couple of the folds in \\"Napkin Folding\\" compelling (not a very good percentage), they also seem to be the ones with the least comprehensible instructions. Ginders is fine when he's writing conventional text, but it seems like he's bent over backwards to make his explanations brief...to the point of uselessness. Answer: A:","output":"I. No;  Based on the given product review, it appears that the reviewer has mixed opinions about the \\"Napkin Folding\\" book. While they find some aspects of it positive, such as visually appealing folds, they are also struggling with the incomprehensible instructions that come with those folds. The title of the review, \\"Some good-looking folds, but incomprehensible instructions,\\" already gives an indication that there are both positive and negative elements to the reviewer's experience with the product. This observation is reinforced by the content of the review, which highlights the fact that the author, Ginders, is fine when writing conventional text but seems to have made his explanations too brief, leading to confusion and difficulty in understanding the instructions. The reviewer also mentions that the appealing folds are a small percentage of those included in the book, suggesting that the product may not have entirely met their expectations or provided enough value for their interest in napkin folding. On the one hand, the positive aspect of the review is the good-looking folds, which the reviewer finds compelling and can be considered an attractive feature of the product. The appreciation for the visual aspect of the folds could appeal to potential buyers who prioritize aesthetics in their napkin folding projects. On the other hand, the main issue mentioned by the reviewer is the incomprehensible instructions, which significantly hinder their ability to enjoy and make use of the product. This could be a major concern for potential buyers, as it indicates that even those with experience in napkin folding, like the reviewer, might struggle to make practical use of the book. Taking both the positive and negative aspects of this review into account, the answer to the question, \\"Is this product review positive?\\" would be option I. No. The reason for this choice is that the review's negative elements, namely the lack of clarity and usefulness of the instructions, outweigh the positive aspect which is the visually appealing folds. While the review does contain some positive feedback, the overall tone and message suggest that the reviewer was not entirely satisfied with the product and found significant issues with its content and usability, making it a less positive review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: It is Halloween in the small town of Pitchford Cove located somewhere in New England, and five high school friends, Phil, Mary, Mitch, Vinnie, and Melissa, plan on making it a night they will never forget. They steal outfits from the town's historic museum and come upon other old artifacts, including an old trunk encasing a paper scroll which contains an ancient curse. When Melissa, latent sorceress, recites the curse at the local cemetery, things take a turn for the worse. The town's dead, led by Melissa's great-great-great-great-grandmother Lucinda Cavender, a witch who was put to death 300 years earlier, rise up from their graves and roam the town. As Melissa, Vinnie, Mitch, and Mary enjoy themselves at their annual Halloween costume party, Phil encounters a mysterious girl, named Sandra \\"Sandy\\" Matthews, dressed in a vintage 1950's cheerleader outfit, who warns him that the whole town is in danger. Meanwhile, Lucinda and the various undead crash the costume party. At first, nobody pays much attention to them since everyone is in costume. However, Lucinda begins turning the party guests into vampires, starting with her great-great-great-great-granddaughter Melissa. When Sandy discovers that Phil and his friends recited the ancient spell in the cemetery, they realize that the whole town is being overrun by the living dead and decide to team up to break the curse. The only way to do so is to find the Grenville Spirit Ring inside the grave of a witch-hunter Nathaniel Grenville - who, coincidentally, was Phil's great-great-great-great-grandfather and slave owner of Lucinda Cavender, her arch-nemesis - and use it to undo the curse.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences essentially convey the same meaning while using slightly different wordings and structures. To provide a detailed comparison and analysis, let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Both sentences refer to a specific type of bias, described as \\"cultural liberal bias\\" in the first sentence and \\"culturally liberal bias\\" in the second sentence. The use of \\"cultural\\" versus \\"culturally\\" is a minor grammatical difference, but the meaning remains the same. In both cases, the sentences discuss a bias that leans towards cultural liberalism. 2. Both sentences mention the same individual, former BBC director Roger Mosey. The first sentence uses \\"former BBC director\\" as a title preceding his name, while the second sentence places a hyphen between \\"former\\" and \\"BBC\\" and uses \\"director\\" as a separate part of his title. Despite these slight formatting differences, the intended meaning is the same - to identify the person who made the classification. 3. Both sentences refer to an alternative classification of the bias as \\"liberal defensive.\\" The first sentence uses single quotes (\`\` '') to set this phrase apart, while the second sentence employs double quotes (\`\` \\"\\"). The use of single or double quotes in this context is a stylistic choice and does not alter the meaning being conveyed. In conclusion, the two sentences are paraphrases because they convey the same idea - that the bias in question can be characterized as both a cultural (or culturally) liberal bias and a liberal defensive bias, as stated by former BBC director Roger Mosey. The primary differences between the sentences are stylistic and do not impact the overall meaning being communicated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which trader would most likely be engaged in black market trading, trader A or trader B?  In the beginning of this century there was scandal in the financial market regarding black market trading. A trader named Trader A was working for Bank A. He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency.  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Trader A would most likely be engaged in black market trading. This is because Trader A is trading country M's currency, which has a fixed exchange rate set by the government. The hint provided suggests that foreign exchange controls, such as a fixed exchange rate, can lead to the creation of black markets for exchanging the weaker currency for stronger currencies. In this scenario, the exchange rate for the foreign currency might be much higher in the black market than the rate set by the government, making it more appealing for traders like Trader A to participate in black market trading. Meanwhile, Trader B is trading country N's currency, a currency that does not have a fixed exchange rate, which makes it less likely for black market trading to occur in that context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth.  - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages.  - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.  - A simple suspension bridge (also rope bridge, swing bridge (in New Zealand), suspended bridge, hanging bridge and catenary bridge) is a primitive type of bridge that is supported entirely from anchors at either end and has no towers or piers. However, it may have saddles. In such bridges, the deck of the bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary load-bearing element, with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges.  - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.  - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete.  - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms and how they integrate with natural or man-made features.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures).  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.  - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.  - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least:  - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands.  - A footbridge (also called a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed for pedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic, and horse riders, instead of vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used decoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In many developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful works of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor.  - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Kingsgate Bridge is a striking , modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building . It was personally designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup , connecting Bow Lane on the historic peninsula in the centre of Durham to Dunelm House on New Elvet ( to which building Arup 's studio also contributed ) , and opened in 1966 . Kingsgate Bridge is thought to have been one of Arup 's favourite designs of all , he having spent many hours working on every detail of the plans . Its construction was unusual . The two halves were each built parallel to the river , then rotated through 90 ° to make the crossing . The meeting point of the two halves is marked by a simple bronze expansion joint . In 1965 , the bridge was the winner of the Civic Trust Award . In 1993 , it won Certificate of Outstanding Performance ( Mature Structures Category ) of the Concrete Society . A bust of Arup , cast in resin , was installed on the side of Dunelm House , the students ' union building adjacent to the bridge , in September 2011 . The sculpture is a copy of a 1987 bust by Diana Brandenburger , held by the National Portrait Gallery . It is a replacement for a previous copy of the same bust , in bronze , which was unveiled by Karin Perry , Arup 's daughter , on 16 April 2003 , the 108th anniversary of Arup 's birth , but which was stolen from its plinth during the summer of 2006 . During a university RAG Week in the early 1960s students suspended a car beneath the bridge . In February 1998 , the Durham Union Society president , Tom Joyce , fell through the bridge , but caught himself and was uninjured .  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit.

Hypothesis: A man wearing a hat and a red shirt is looking at someone else. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, we can conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise.  The premise provides a detailed description of the situation: \\"A man with a red shirt and black hat stares at another man.\\" This statement presents a clear picture of a man who is dressed in a particular attire, specifically, a red shirt and a black hat. Furthermore, the premise states that this man is staring at another man. Moving to the hypothesis, it states: \\"A man wearing a hat and a red shirt is looking at someone else.\\" This hypothesis seems to be a more generalized version of the premise. Here, too, we have a man donning a hat and a red shirt. While the hat's color is not explicitly mentioned, it doesn't contradict the premise – the possibility of this man wearing a black hat is still valid. Additionally, the hypothesis asserts that the man is fixated on (or looking at) someone else. When comparing both the premise and the hypothesis, they share similarities in terms of the man's clothing and his action of staring or looking at another person. The presence of a red shirt, a hat (potentially black), and the man's engagement with another individual aligns with the asserted hypothesis. Taking the provided information into account, it can be concluded that the hypothesis generally aligns with the given premise. The man's clothing, the color of his hat, and the fact that he is observing another man are consistent between the premise and the hypothesis. While there are slight differences in their wordings, such as \\"looking at\\" versus \\"stares at,\\" and the slightly less detailed hat description in the hypothesis, these differences are not significant enough to negate the hypothesis.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Movie star  for the following movie plot:  The film is centered on Mortal Kombat, a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the Elder Gods amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle.

Information:  - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.  - The Coimbra Group (CG) is an association of long-established European multidisciplinary universities of high international standard.

A prime integer is defined as an integer that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The task is to remove any integer that is not prime from a given list of integers and return the list of prime numbers. To accomplish this task, I would follow these steps: 1. Create an empty list called 'prime_list' to store the prime integers found in the input list. 2. Loop through each integer in the given input list. 3. For each integer, check if it's a prime number. To do this, I can implement a function that takes the integer as input and returns True if it's prime and False otherwise. 4. Inside the prime checking function, since 1 is not considered a prime number, return False if the input is 1. If the input is 2, return True since 2 is the smallest prime number. For other integers greater than 2, check for divisibility by the integers in the range of 2 to the square root of the number + 1. If any of them is a factor, return False, otherwise, return True. 5. If the prime checking function returns True, append the integer to the 'prime_list'. 6. Continue the loop until all integers in the input list have been checked. 7. Return 'prime_list' as the output. If no prime numbers were found, the output will be an empty list. For the given input [877, 463, 540], applying the mentioned steps, I find that 877 and 463 are prime integers, while 540 is not prime as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Malone rolled over in the soft hotel bed. Not just gold but the things it would buy. A two-story house of brick and wrought iron. Greek columns in front and coaches parked in the drive. Built high on the center of Galveston Island, away from the deadly storms of the Gulf, away from the noise and stink of the port. White servants and negro slaves. Fair-haired women to sit at the piano in his parlor. Dark-skinned women to open their legs to him in the secrecy of the night... He sat up in a sweat. I will think no evil thoughts, he told himself. Outside, the sun rose over New Orleans. Horse-drawn carts creaked and rattled through the streets, and chickens complained about the light. The smell of the Mississippi, damp and sexual, floated through the open window. Malone got up and put a robe on over his nightshirt, despite the heat. He turned up the gas lamp over the desk, took out pen, ink and paper, and began to write. 'My dearest Becky...' * He smelled the French Market before he saw it, a mixture of decayed fruit, coffee, and leather. He crossed Decatur Street to avoid a side of beef hung over the sidewalk, swarming with flies. Voices shouted in a dozen different languages. All manner of decrepit wooden carts stood on the street, their contents passed from hand to hand until they disappeared under the yellow canvas awnings of the market.

However, based on the information and context provided, we can postulate multiple possible outcomes for Malone. 1. Successful Treasure Hunter: Considering Malone's fixation on pirate gold and the wealth it would bring, it is plausible that he might pursue a life of adventure, seeking lost treasures and hidden fortunes. He could potentially become a famous treasure hunter or explorer, using his newfound wealth to live a life of luxury, with a grand house and numerous servants and companions as described in his thoughts. 2. Manifestation of Evil Thoughts: Although Malone tells himself not to think evil thoughts, the allure of material wealth may lead him down a darker path. It is possible that he could become involved in illicit activities such as smuggling, piracy, or criminal operations in order to obtain the riches he dreams of. This may result in him living a life of opulence but also constantly being in danger and potentially falling afoul of the law. 3. Disappointed Dreamer: Alternatively, Malone might not find the anticipated treasure or be able to attain the wealth he desires. He could end up disillusioned by the harsh realities of life and struggle to make ends meet. Despite his lofty dreams, he may be forced to live a humble life, constantly reminiscing about the riches that could have been. 4. Reformed and Content: Malone might eventually realize that material wealth is not the key to happiness and fulfillment. He could choose to reassess his priorities and focus on building a life filled with love, friendship, and personal growth. Malone might find contentment in a modest lifestyle, appreciating the simple pleasures and relationships that enrich one's life. Ultimately, without any definitive closure or resolution, it is impossible to say precisely which of these paths Malone would take after the end of the story.

Katrina celebrates Christmas every single year with their family while Tanya celebrates Hanukkah with theirs.  OPTIONS: [+] Katrina practices Judaism.. [+] Tanya practices Judaism..","output":"Both families had their distinct traditions, but what made it special was the deep friendship between Katrina and Tanya despite these differences. However, this year was slightly different, as Tanya's family decided to invite Katrina's family to their home to celebrate Hanukkah together. This made Katrina not only excited but also a little nervous as she did not know much about Hanukkah traditions. Before going into the story, let's establish the background for our two main characters: [+] Katrina practices Judaism;  [+] Tanya practices Judaism. Since both Katrina and Tanya practice Judaism, it was not odd for them to share their cultural practices. This year's joint celebration would be a heartwarming experience where both families could learn more about each other's customs, embrace the similarities, and respect the differences. As the day approached, Katrina and her family decided to do some research to learn about Hanukkah, its rituals, and the traditional food served during the eight-day celebration. They wanted to be prepared and respectful when participating in the festivities with Tanya's family. On the first night of Hanukkah, Katrina's family arrived at Tanya's house, bringing some traditional Christmas treats as a gesture of goodwill. Tanya's family warmly welcomed them, and the two families began their evening by lighting the menorah together. Step 1: Lighting the Menorah The families gathered to light the menorah. Tanya's father handed Katrina's father the shamash, the special candle used to light the other candles on the menorah. This was an opportunity for both families to bond while participating in an important Hanukkah ritual. Step 2: Reciting prayers While lighting the menorah, Tanya's mother led the families in reciting the Hanukkah blessings. Katrina's family listened carefully and tried their best to follow along, showing their respect for Tanya's family's traditions. Step 3: Sharing the Meal After lighting the menorah and reciting the prayers, it was time for dinner. Tanya's family had prepared various traditional Hanukkah dishes, such as latkes and sufganiyot. They explained the significance of these dishes to Katrina's family, and everyone sat down to enjoy the delicious food. Step 4: Playing Dreidel As the meal came to an end, Tanya suggested playing the dreidel game, a traditional Hanukkah activity. Tanya's family taught Katrina's family the rules, and everyone got involved in the game, laughing and having a great time. Step 5: Gift Exchange As a way to combine the two celebrations and show appreciation for each other's traditions, the families decided to have a small gift exchange. Katrina's family gifted Tanya's family a lovely set of Christmas ornaments, while Tanya's family gave Katrina's family a beautiful menorah. This year's combined celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas was a unique and meaningful experience for both families. By embracing each other's traditions, they not only deepened their friendship but also enriched their understanding of each other's beliefs. As they vowed to continue such gatherings in the future, the bond between Katrina and Tanya grew stronger, and the love and respect between their families blossomed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen). That night, D'Artagnan is pleasantly surprised when Bernajou's ward Constance (Heather Angel) enters the room. It turns out that it is actually her chamber, though she is rarely there, as she spends most of her time at the palace as lady-in-waiting to the Queen.

When I walked in, the music was very loud latin music. It reminded me of music you hear at a night club.   The towels felt more warm than hot. When I mentioned the towels weren't hot, she argued they were hot!! I'm not sure, but I think the towel might have been hot. I think she pulled it out of the hot box and ran it under hot water. The hot water isn't nearly as hot as the towel when it comes out of the hot box, so it actually would cool the towel. Not positive if that is what happened, but the towel should have been much hotter and the barber should not have argued with me.    The barber was a very young woman.

Answer the following question: This article: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?, what is it ?

That’s according to a new report from Microsoft Canada, which included an online survey of more than 2,000 Canadians, as well as an observation of more than 100 study participants doing tasks while their brainwaves were measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The larger survey group was also asked to perform game-like tasks that measure different types of attention, such as looking for patterns in a series, or spotting differences in a set of images.      The research found that more digitally savvy consumers have high bursts of intense attention at the beginning of a task, but that attention falls over time. By contrast, less frequent digital users tend to have lower bursts of attention out of the gate, but increased attention over a sustained period of time.      However, researchers caution that this does not necessarily mean that digitally connected people don’t register information mentally: When observed while connected to EEG, that group showed high instances of brain signals associated with encoding information to memory, even though they have lower attention spans over all.      And shortened attention spans are not just a phenomenon among younger people; people who are highly digitally engaged, no matter the age, showed similar results.      The point of the research, in part, is to help advertisers understand how to craft marketing communications in a changing media environment. It’s important that ads adjust for digital Canadians’ front-loaded attention spans, which drop off quickly, said Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead at Microsoft Canada.      “We need to be more clear and concise with messaging as early as possible – almost crafting headlines,” Ms. Gausby said, suggesting that marketers take their cues from billboards, which have always had to compete to be noticed in environments with plenty of stimuli.      The research also looked at how people behave in multiscreen environments, such as the common habit of picking up a smartphone during a lag in entertainment. It showed that people are becoming effective at multitasking, and paying attention to more than one thing at a time.      “They were on their phones, and … they were reacting to what was happening on the TV even when they weren’t watching it,” Ms. Gausby said. “They were still laughing at the jokes, or when there were auditory cues, such as a tense moment, they would all look up. … It’s great news for marketers that multiscreening doesn’t reduce the potential impact of marketing.”      Canadians’ digital behaviours      When nothing is occupying my attention, the first thing I do is reach for my phone      65+: 10% agree      18 to 24 y.o.: 77% agree      I check my phone at least every 30 minutes      65+: 6%      18-24: 52%      The last thing I do before I go to bed is check my phone      65+: 18%      18-24: 73%      I often use other devices while watching TV      65+: 42%      18-24: 79%      I watch more TV programs through catch-up/streamed TV than live      65+: 13%      18-24: 74%      I often watch a number of episodes of a show back-to-back      65+: 43%      18-24: 87%      How changing attention spans affect people at work/school      Really have to concentrate hard to stay focused on tasks at work/school      All: 44%      Highest among:      Early tech adopters: 68%      Heavy social-media users: 67%      18- to 24-year-olds: 67%      Heavy multiscreeners: 57%      High-volume media consumers: 55%      Get sidetracked from what they’re doing at work/school by unrelated thoughts or daydreams      All: 45%      Highest among:      Early tech adopters: 66%      Heavy social-media users: 65%      18- to 24-year-olds: 61%      Heavy multiscreeners: 60%      High-volume media consumers: 55%      Don’t make the best use of their time so sometimes they have to work late/weekends      All: 37%      Highest among:      18- to 24-year-olds: 71%      Early tech adopters: 62%      Heavy social-media users: 62%      Heavy multiscreeners: 51%      High-volume media consumers: 48%      Source: Microsoft attention spans online survey, Spring 2015, 2,000 Canadian respondents      Report Typo/Error ||||| People now have shorter attention spans than goldfish — and our always-on portable devices may be to blame, a new study suggests.      The study from Microsoft Corp. draws on surveys of more than 2,000 Canadians who played games online in order to determine the impact that pocket-sized devices and the increased availability of digital media and information are having on everyday life. Researchers also did in-lab monitoring, using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to monitor brain activity of 112 people.      Among the findings of the 54-page study was that, thanks to our desire to always be connected, people can multi-task like never before. However, our attention spans have fallen from an average of 12 seconds in the year 2000 to just eight seconds today. A goldfish is believed to have a nine-second attention span on average, the study says.      “Canadians with more digital lifestyles (those who consume more media, are multi-screeners, social media enthusiasts, or earlier adopters of technology) struggle to focus in environments where prolonged attention is needed,” reads the study.      “While digital lifestyles decrease sustained attention overall, it’s only true in the long-term. Early adopters and heavy social media users front load their attention and have more intermittent bursts of high attention. They’re better at identifying what they want/don’t want to engage with and need less to process and commit things to memory.”      Microsoft’s data is supported by similar findings released by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information and the National Library of Medicine in the U.S.      Among the most concerning findings of the study is our declining ability to sustain our focus during repetitive activities: Forty-four per cent of respondents said they had to concentrate really hard to stay focused on tasks, while 37 per cent said they were unable to make the best use of their time, forcing them to work late evenings and or weekends.      The study further found evidence to suggest that people are increasingly displaying “addiction-like behaviours” when it comes to their devices:      • 77 per cent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 24 reported they reach for their phone or mobile device when they feel bored;      • 52 per cent check their phone every 30 minutes or less; and      • 79 per cent reported using their portable devices while watching television.      Bruce Morton, a researcher with the University of Western Ontario’s Brain & Mind Institute, said it’s actually a natural reaction that the human brain is having.      The brain is remarkable when it comes to collecting information and processing it, Morton said. The more you feed it, the hungrier it gets. Technology is now feeding it an ever-expanding diet.      “When we first invented the car, it was so novel. The thought of having an entertainment device in the car was ridiculous because the car itself was the entertainment,” he said. “After a while, travelling for eight hours at a time, you’d had enough of it. The brain is bored. You put radios in the car and video displays. Why? Because after the first 10 minutes of the drive I’ve had enough already. I understand this.”      “Just because we may be allocating our attention differently as a function of the technologies we may be using, it doesn’t mean that the way our attention actually can function has changed,” he said. “Digital technologies dovetail seamlessly into the information processing abilities of our brain.”      Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead with Microsoft Canada, said the company conducted the research on behalf of marketing firms to help them better understand how people are using today’s mobile technologies.      “We know that consumers’ lives are increasingly digital whether at home or at work, or anywhere in-between. We see now that news is reduced to 140 characters, some conversations are condensed to emojis and we wanted to understand how this affecting the way that Canadians see and interact with the world,” said Gausby. “It’s our new ‘newsfeed reality,’ as I like to put it.”      Microsoft’s study is considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. ||||| The Kimpton hotel chain across Canada and the US will put a goldfish in any guests hotel room for the duration of their stay if they are feeling a bit lonely. It is called the 'Guppy Love' program and hotel staff will make sure it is fed and cared for.      Ever wonder if that device that never leaves your hand is taking a toll on your attention span?            A 54-page Microsoft study that looked at surveys of more than 2,000 Canadians — and monitored 112 people’s brain activity — says it is.      In fact, we now have shorter attention spans than goldfish, a fact researchers believe can be linked to our inability to put down our smartphones and other portable devices.      A study in 2000 revealed that Canadians had 12-second attention spans, on average. That number has now dropped to 8 seconds, an entire second shorter than that of goldfish.      “Canadians with more digital lifestyles (those who consume more media, are multi-screeners, social media enthusiasts, or earlier adopters of technology) struggle to focus in environments where prolonged attention is needed,” reads the study.      The study found a number of concerning statistics and “addiction-like behaviours” from the always-connected respondents: 44 per cent of respondents claimed they had to concentrate really hard to stay focused on tasks, 37 per cent said they were unable to make the best use of their time (often leading to working late in the evenings and on weekends), 77 per cent of respondents admitted to reaching for their phones when they feel bored, and 79 per cent reported using portable devices even when watching TV.      The study was intended to help marketers reach their multitasking audience. Apparently using your smartphone while you watch TV is a good thing for advertisers.      “They were on their phones, and…they were reacting to what was happening on the TV even when they weren’t watching it,” Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead with Microsoft Canada, told the Globe and Mail of observing participants in a multiscreen environment. “They were still laughing at the jokes, or when there were auditory cues, such as a tense moment, they would all look up.”      “It’s great news for marketers that multiscreening doesn’t reduce the potential impact of marketing.”      Gausby said Microsoft conducted the research to better understand how people are using today’s technologies.      “We see now that news is reduced to 140 characters, some conversations are condensed to emojis and we wanted to understand how this affecting the way that Canadians see and interact with the world,” she said. “It’s our new ‘newsfeed reality,’ as I like to put it.”      Bruce Morton, a researcher with the University of Western Ontario’s Brain & Mind Institute, told the Ottawa Citizen that the more we feed the brain, the hungrier it gets.      “When we first invented the car, it was so novel.

The brain is bored. You put radios in the car and video displays. Why? Because after the first 10 minutes of the drive, I’ve had enough already. I understand this.”      Just because we’re now allocating our attention differently doesn’t necessarily mean “the way our attention actually can function has changed,” he said.      Morton added, “digital technologies dovetail seamlessly into the information processing abilities of our brain.”      Last year, advertising researchers tracked 200 British people’s gadget habits and found that the average person switched devices a whopping 21 times an hour.            How often do you put down your devices? Have you noticed your attention span shortening since you started carrying a smartphone with you everywhere? ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A new study by Microsoft Canada reveals that the increasing usage of digital devices is changing our attention spans, finding that more digitally inclined individuals, regardless of age, tend to have high bursts of intense focus at the beginning of a task, but their attention quickly diminishes over time. On the other hand, those who are less frequently engaged in digital activities have lower initial attention but an increased focus over an extended period. The study involved over 2,000 Canadians participating in online surveys and tasks, with their brainwaves being measured using electroencephalography. The research aims to help advertisers better understand how to adjust their strategies in a rapidly changing media environment to account for the varying attention spans of consumers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is: The Caribbean island where a test match was abandoned in 2009 after only 10 balls were bowled is Antigua. The event took place during the second Test match between England and West Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua. This match was scheduled from February 13th to 17th, 2009 as a part of the 2009 Test series between the two teams. On the very first morning of the match, February 13th, 2009, England's captain Andrew Strauss won the toss and chose to bat first. However, the match got off to an unusual start as West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards slipped several times while delivering the first over. After only 10 balls were bowled, it became evident that the sandy and soft outfield conditions were dangerous for the players. Umpires Tony Hill and Rudi Koertzen, along with match referee Alan Hurst, decided to abandon the game because of the unsuitable playing conditions. This became the second shortest Test match in history, with the shortest being the 1995 Test match between West Indies and England in the Guyana National Stadium, which was abandoned after only 2 balls due to a wet and dangerous pitch. The abandonment of the 2009 Antigua Test was a significant moment in cricket history as it raised concerns about the standard of pitch preparation and highlighted the importance of player safety. The rest of the series was played without any further interruptions, and the replacement third Test match was held at the Antigua Recreation Ground from February 15th to 19th, 2009. The series concluded with West Indies winning 1-0, after winning the first Test in Jamaica and drawing the remaining matches in Antigua, Barbados, and Trinidad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And I was wondering How would you describe Quinn? OPT: (A). intoxicated (B). foolish (C). very cavalier with their partying Answer:","output":"Quinn's behavior, as described, can be characterized in various ways, encompassing aspects of all the given options. To provide a comprehensive understanding of Quinn's behavior, it is essential to analyze each aspect individually. (A) Intoxicated: Quinn had too much to drink, which most likely led to a level of intoxication. When a person consumes excessive alcohol, their behavior, motor functions, and decision-making abilities are impaired. This impairment could have contributed to Quinn being kicked out of the bar. (B) Foolish: Quinn's decision to overindulge in alcohol with friends can certainly be described as foolish. By consuming too much alcohol and being unable to control their behavior, Quinn put themselves and possibly others in an uncomfortable or even dangerous situation. It is important to consume alcohol responsibly and prioritize one's well-being and safety, as well as the well-being and safety of others. Failing to do so is a display of poor judgment, which can be considered foolish behavior. (C) Very cavalier with their partying: The described scenario indicates that Quinn did not demonstrate proper restraint or consideration for the consequences of their actions. By engaging in excessive and potentially reckless partying, Quinn exemplified a cavalier attitude toward consuming alcohol and socializing with friends. This lack of seriousness and responsibility can have various negative implications, such as jeopardizing personal relationships or facing legal consequences. In conclusion, based on the provided information, Quinn can be described as intoxicated, foolish, and very cavalier with their partying. It is crucial to understand the importance of responsible drinking and the potential consequences of uncontrolled alcohol consumption. Engaging in reckless behavior can have long-lasting, negative effects on one's personal and social life, and may even result in legal problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dead Snow Movie plot: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin.

Movie title: La Moustache Context: This synopsis is especially detailed in the hope that it will help interpret this enigmatic film.La moustache starts with a view of waves in darkness. The first words, in darkness, are \\"What if I shaved my moustache off?\\" Now, we see Marc (Vincent Lindon) shaving, and his girlfriend Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) responds \\"I don't know you without it\\". She leaves, and he submerges in his bath water for a moment. Only then is there music as background to his shaving the moustache and thoroughly washing it down the drain. Later, there is a ring, and he starts for the door. She comes in asking \\"why didn't you let me in?\\". He waits in vain for her to notice his clean lip. Instead, she says he hasn't commented on her \\"tarty look\\". They drive to their friends Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and Nadia's (Macha Polikarpova) house, and he says to go in while he parks. Even Serge's little girl doesn't notice the missing moustache.Marc overhears Serge call Agnes two-faced, and insists on hearing the story. About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar. On their drive home, Marc says \\"the joke has gone far enough\\", her pretending not to notice he shaved the moustache. She adamantly insists \\"I don't understand?.Finally in bed she yells \\"You know you've never had a moustache\\". He says she plotted with Serge and Nadia, so she phones them and they deny it.

The servers were very attentive and did everything possible to make our experience memorable, and the food was wonderful.  I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad.  (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.)  By itself the souffle would have been too overpowering, but alternated with bites of the salad, it made for a very balanced dish.  My main course was chicken two ways, which has been described here by others, so I'll just say that it was a wonderful choice and surprisingly filling.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\\"The Mighty One\\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \\"haves\\" (to which they belong) and the \\"have-nots\\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\".  In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly.  Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957).  In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he win any other awards?","output":"Yes, he won several awards. For example, after his performance in the film \\"From Here to Eternity,\\" he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Most people are never really alone. Living here in New York, we're constantly surrounded by others. Even in the state's biggest wilderness, the Adirondacks, you can't get more than 15 miles or so from civilization. Similar levels of population density can be found in most of the lower 48 states. So when we heard about Heimo and Edna Korth, a couple who live 150 miles above the Arctic Circle and 60 miles from their nearest neighbors, we had to go meet them. The Korths reside in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area about the size of South Carolina in the northeast corner of the state. It is bordered by the Beaufort Sea on the north and Canada's Yukon to the east. There are other people living in the refuge -- Inuit in Kaktovik and the Gwich'in of Arctic Village -- but as far as we know, the Korths are the most isolated humans in the area. They live in the most remote location in America and sustain themselves by hunting, fishing and trapping. They've lived like this for more than 30 years, raising a family in the process and all the while dealing with grizzly bears and temperatures that dip as low as minus-50 degrees Fahrenheit. Their home turf is inhospitable in the truest sense of the word. See the rest of Heimo's Arctic Refuge at VBS.TV. As much as Heimo Korth truly is the Final Frontiersman, he's no Luddite. He uses lots of modern tools: guns, the radio, a satellite phone, a chainsaw and, most important, a gasoline-powered snow machine (a snowmobile in recreational terms) to check his miles of traps. In the wake of the BP spill, the refuge has received renewed attention from the \\"drill, baby, drill\\" crowd, which refuses to ever let a good crisis go to waste. Their claims that the refuge is uninhabited will ring particularly hollow after you watch the above video and catch a glimpse inside the Korths' lives. They are, after all, Americans and seem to be doing their own thing in their own time, which is perhaps the most American activity of all. Still, we didn't set out to make a documentary about the politics of oil drilling. That's boring and has been done a million times already. What we wanted was to tell the story of a pair of the last Americans who use well-honed skills to survive solely off the land, skills that we are losing at our own peril. The Korths supplement their myriad abilities with the benefits of oil-based products and machines. They understand the necessity of oil. We all do.

Write a summary based on this article: A half-loaded handgun, an underground bunker accessible from a wooden hatch camouflaged with dirt, and more than 1,000 bicycles tucked in a separate tunnel were discovered along the Santa Ana River trail near a former homeless encampment where residents were recently displaced, Orange County Sheriff’s Department officials said this week.      The county began clearing more than 150 homeless people from the area between Warner and Edinger avenues on Nov. 7 after months of complaints from nearby condominium residents about unsanitary conditions and other nuisances at the encampment.      Sheriff’s Lt. Jeff Puckett said the recent finds seem to add credence to Fountan Valley neighbors’ complaints that conditions along the river were unsafe.      “We’ve collected data over the last 2½ months that shows there’s a large criminal presence in the encampments, and this evidence would seem to back that data up,” Puckett said.      He said the Sheriff’s Department has made more than 260 arrests in the past several months in various encampments along the river trail in connection with crimes such as robbery, assault and trespassing.      However, homeless advocates have contended the county is criminalizing homelessness and shuffling the camps’ population around instead of solving the growing problem.      The county plans to permanently close the west side of the flood control channel between 17th Street in Santa Ana and Adams Avenue in Huntington Beach as it prepares to start maintenance of Orange County Flood Control District property along the trail, officials have said.      Before maintenance begins, Orange County Public Works officials have been tasked with cleaning debris and trash from the former encampment in Fountain Valley.      Puckett said officials found a .357 Magnum containing three empty shell casings — indicating to authorities that it had been fired — near the camp. The Sheriff’s Department is investigating where the gun came from.      Courtesy of the Orange County Sheriff's Department A .357 Magnum with three expended shell casings was found along the Santa Ana River trail in Fountain Valley, police say. A .357 Magnum with three expended shell casings was found along the Santa Ana River trail in Fountain Valley, police say. (Courtesy of the Orange County Sheriff's Department)      When public works crews arrived to clean up trash two weeks ago, they discovered more than 1,000 bicycles tucked into a tunnel along the concrete river bed in Santa Ana, just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass.      “I’ve been doing this job for 20 years and even I was stunned by that one,” Puckett said.      Workers dragged out the bikes and hauled them to a storage yard.      Puckett said the department at some point will likely allow the public to look at the bikes in an effort to reunite people with lost or stolen property.      Authorities said there were indications that someone was living in the area of the bikes, but they haven’t identified whom that might have been or how and why the bikes were obtained.      Authorities said they don’t know how many of the bikes might have been stolen.      “Common sense would usually dictate if you have 1,000 bikes in a tunnel, some of them could be stolen,” Puckett said.      On Thursday, county officials found a man-made bunker six feet underground along the trail. A plywood trap door opened to wooden steps, which led to a 10-by-10-foot living space reinforced with wood beams. The room was tall enough for an adult to stand in, authorities said.

(Courtesy of Orange County Sheriff's Department)      Puckett said the bunker was empty when authorities stumbled upon it.      Kris Gillan, who lives in the New Chase condominiums near the river trail in Fountain Valley, said that of all the items found, she was most surprised to hear about the bunker.      “Nothing like guns, trash and needles would shock me, but the fact that someone had a whole downstairs living arrangement … it’s weird that they built it without us knowing,” she said.      Gillan said she can’t believe it took officials months to begin clearing the area.      “It’s like, ‘Shame on you, county — look what was going on,’” she said. “We tried to tell you.”      The trail was deserted Friday afternoon. Orange bags filled with trash were lined up waiting to be hauled away.      Nearby residents said most of the homeless people who had set up camp there packed up and left within three days of the county’s enforcement effort.      Gillan said the area is quiet and getting cleaner every day.      County officials hope to keep it that way. The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to pay California Panther Security 450,000 over the next two years to have unarmed security guards open and close gates along the trail and report trespassers to the Sheriff’s Department, according to a county staff report.      hannah.fry@latimes.com      Twitter: @HannahFryTCN ||||| The makeshift bunker beneath a recently-displaced Fountain Valley homeless encampment was big enough for a grown person to stand inside, replete with wood-paneled walls and a support beam, and accessible only via a small hatch camouflaged to blend in with its dirt surroundings.

Homeless men ride past a bunker that was discovered by Orange County Public Works near the Fountain Valley homeless encampment. (Photo courtesy of OC Sheriff’s Dept.)      Orange County sheriff’s deputies and public employees said they uncovered unusual and dangerous conditions in the recently cleared homeless camps on the riverbed in Fountain Valley and in portions of the river to the north. The findings, they said, posed public safety risks and indicated that the area was rife with crime.      “It just backs up the data that we’ve collected, which says there is a significant criminal element in the homeless encampments,” sheriff’s Lt. Jeff Puckett said.      The sheriff’s department provided no evidence linking the gun or bicycles to any individuals living in the Fountain Valley encampment but said the investigation is ongoing.      County employees discovered the bunker Wednesday, Nov. 16, as part of a cleanup effort after the county forced about 200 people to move out of the area five days earlier.      The cavern’s hatch was concealed beneath a thin layer of dirt. But once workers opened the plywood trapdoor, they found a series of wooden steps that took them six feet underground, to a reinforced, 10-foot-by-10-foot room big enough for a 5-foot-7-inch person to stand upright.      Officials don’t know how the bunker was built or who used it.      “We’re not sure what (the room) was for – probably some type of living situation,” Puckett said. “It’s nothing I’ve ever seen before.”      The county moved to clear the encampment, located between Warner and Edinger avenues, following months of complaints from neighbors that homeless people were trespassing, harassing residents and stealing from nearby homes. Some of the discoveries, officials said, add credence to those neighbors’ complaints and fears.      The gun, for example, is of interest to investigators. Puckett declined to say where the gun was found, though he indicated it was discovered a week ago. He also couldn’t discuss if the gun was used in any open crimes or other details of the investigation.      The bicycle collection also is being investigated.      Though makeshift chop shops where bicycles are taken apart, cleaned and reassembled are a common sight along several portions of the lengthy riverbed homeless encampments, Pucket said he’d never seen a collection as big as the 1,000 bicycles hidden in Santa Ana. The bikes were found just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass.      Puckett wouldn’t speculate how many of the bikes were stolen, citing the ongoing investigation, saying “common sense would dictate that if you have 1,000 bikes in a tunnel… some of them were stolen.”      After Public Works employees discovered the stockpile two weeks ago, workers labored to drag the bicycles out of the tunnels before hauling them off in four large trucks to a nearby storage yard. Puckett said at some point the department probably will let the public look at the cache in an effort to reunite lost or stolen bikes with their owners.      Fountain Valley police Sgt. Kham Vang said the city hadn’t recently experienced an increase in bike thefts, though he noted that most bicycle thefts go unreported.      But neighborhood residents offer a different story, saying they’ve noticed an increase in bike thefts and other crimes.      “I’m not surprised at any of these things they found, other than the bunker,” said Kris Gillan, who owns a condo near the riverbed. “This is why we tried and tried to get (sheriff’s deputies and Fountain Valley) out there, but nothing was done for a long, long time.”      She said a neighbor’s bike was stolen recently off a patio, and that she regularly saw people lurking in the complex and looking inside parked cars. As the encampment grew, she said, so did crime.      “I feel safer now that they’re gone,” Gillan said.      “But how did it get this bad? I hope the county has learned their lesson.”      Earlier this year, the sheriff’s department and local police departments disputed which agency had jurisdiction over portions of the riverbed, leaving some areas largely unpatrolled. That changed in September, when the sheriff’s department began patrolling the Santa Ana River encampments, making hundreds of arrests. And during the past week, the county began enforcing a public-access curfew to the river trail, hiring private security guards to help enforce it.      Supervisor Todd Spitzer said Thursday that the bicycles and the recovered gun were proof that “the riverbed encampments are a serious public safety concern and the county must continue to clear out these trespassers.”      But as the county worked last Friday to clear the Fountain Valley encampment, many homeless people said they didn’t know where they would move. Social service workers said the action will simply push some people back to the streets of adjacent cities and force others to move to the already-crowded riverbed encampments in Anaheim and Orange, where neighbors and businesses also are complaining.      Editors note: A previous version of this story quoted the sheriff’s department as saying the bicycles were found near the Fountain Valley homeless encampment. OC Public Works later clarified that the bikes were found two miles northeast of the camp, just south of the river’s Fairview Street overpass in Santa Ana. This story has been updated to reflect that information. ||||| Summary:","output":"Police found a hidden underground bunker, a half-loaded gun and more than 1,000 bicycles near a former homeless place in Santa Ana River trail, Orange County.

The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men. The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted to a war they clearly don't sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island. The local orthodox priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa.

Q:Title: Sweet Surprise Product review: If you thought 'Little Willy' and 'Ballroom Blitz' was all this band had to offer this album will make you think again. All 10 tracks are taken from the mid seventies period when Chinn/Chapman had been discarded in favour of their own compositions and some pretty muscular stuff resulted. I was never a fan of bubblegum or glam rock and that's why this collection is very agreeable. No singles. No filler. No nonsense, this is good.The guitar work is very good bordering on Purple-esque at times, especially 'Sweet F A' which reminded me of 'Speed King'. Rhythm section is tight and hard working and the vocals excellent with great harmonies. You may not recognise any of these songs but don't let that put you off.Do yourself a favour and discover the other side of The Sweet. If you like your rock hard, heavy with a mix of intellegence, then this is for you. Check out the Zep type riff of 'White Mice' just one of many delights on this album. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review certainly depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer seems pleasantly surprised by the album's content, especially since it moves away from what they perceive as the band's bubblegum or glam rock image. They highlight the strong guitar work, tight rhythm section, excellent vocals, and great harmonies, comparing the tracks to famous bands like Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. By stating that there are no singles, no filler, and no nonsense in the album, the reviewer implies that the entire collection is filled with quality tracks, showcasing the band's creative and versatile side. They encourage others to explore this lesser-known aspect of The Sweet's discography and appreciate the intelligent and heavy rock music offered by the album. The review emphasizes the album's multiple delights and recommends it to those who enjoy hard, heavy rock music with a mix of intelligence. Overall, this review paints a very positive and flattering picture of the product, indicating that the band has more to offer than just their famous hits like 'Little Willy' and 'Ballroom Blitz,' thus possibly attracting new listeners or convincing existing fans to give this album a chance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After Arghun's death, he was followed in rapid succession by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam when he took the throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia. In 1299, he made the first of what were to be three attempts to invade Syria. As he launched his new invasion, he also sent letters to the Franks of Cyprus (Henry II, King of Cyprus; and the heads of the military orders), inviting them to come join him in his attack on the Mamluks in Syria. The Mongols successfully took the city of Aleppo, and were there joined by their vassal King Hethum II, whose forces participated in the rest of the offensive. The Mongols soundly defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar,  on December 23 or 24, 1299. This success in Syria led to wild rumors in Europe that the Mongols had successfully re-captured the Holy Land, and had even conquered the Mamluks in Egypt and were on a mission to conquer Tunisia in northern Africa. But in reality, Jerusalem had been neither taken nor even besieged. All that had been managed were some Mongol raids into Palestine in early 1300. The raids went as far as Gaza, passing through several towns, probably including Jerusalem. But when the Egyptians again advanced from Cairo in May, the Mongols retreated without resistance.In July 1300, the Crusaders launched naval operations to press the advantage. A fleet of sixteen galleys with some smaller vessels was equipped in Cyprus, commanded by King Henry of Cyprus, accompanied by his brother Amalric, Prince of Tyre, the heads of the military orders, and Ghazan's ambassador \\"Chial\\" (Isol the...

It has launched a new campaign focusing on the social side of sport to encourage more women to get involved. The Our Squad site lets people register activities and contact organisers. The online community unites a variety of sports, from roller derby to softball, and encourages women to get involved and try out the site's different sporting offerings. Sport Wales chief executive Sarah Powell said the campaign was about seeing sport in a different light and \\"putting fun at the forefront\\". \\"We're not telling people about sport, rather we're tapping into what motivates them to take part,\\" she said, adding a lot of women and girls surveyed said they took part for social reasons. Ms Powell added barriers women faced getting into sport included children, career and lack of confidence, but she hoped the campaign would encourage them to \\"take the first steps\\". The body drew on research from the National Survey for Wales highlighting the lower levels of female participation in sport. Sara Phillips, 12, plays for Wales' female under-13 team, and also for Carmarthenshire under-13 boys, Llanelli Cricket Club's under-15 years team, the second team and last Saturday she played for first team too. It is the first time in Llanelli's 178-year history a female has been chosen to play for the first team. Sara hopes she will inspire other girls to play cricket. \\"Sometimes they only see boys playing, but girls have more of a chance to play because there aren't many of us, so it helps us improve in sport,\\" she said. Second team captain Rhys Westcott said: \\"The point was discussed by the two club captains who felt it was the right time to bring the first girl into the teams, and Sara was the one who was chosen... we hope as more women come through, it will start a trend through the club now.\\" Our Squad is supported by ambassadors, who each have their own reason for taking part in sport. Among them is Angeline Tshiyane, 53, from Newport, who has set up a number of groups to help encourage an active lifestyle among the region's black, minority and ethnic (BME) communities. She launched her own weekly swimming sessions for children and adults from BME backgrounds, as well as the country's first female only BME walking group. \\"More women need to recognise the benefits of taking part in sport,\\" she said. \\"Not only is it great for your health, but it's a great way to make friendships and raise your confidence.\\" Angharad Sian Roche, 34, is a softball player who set up Wales' first Welsh-language team, Teirw'r Taf, which competes in the Cardiff Softball League. Ms Roche said friendship was the driving force behind the team's success. \\"You have an instant common interest and everybody taking part wants every member of the team to enjoy themselves,\\" she said, adding it was also good for \\"burning a few calories\\". Despite being told by doctors at 26 she would never run or jump again due to osteoarthritis, basketball player Caroline Matthews went on to represent Team GB at two Paralympic Games and then took up the wheelchair version of the sport. Ms Matthews, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, now coaches her own wheelchair basketball squad, Archers Wheelchair Basketball Club. Emily Roberts, 16, from Llandudno, Conwy county, suffered with low self-esteem as a result of years of bullying at school, before taking up karate aged 10 to build her confidence. Emily credits karate with helping her \\"break down the barriers she put up when she was bullied\\" and helping her to make friends. Skater Stephanie Howarth, 30, has represented Cardiff's Tiger Bay Brawlers at UK, European and American roller derby tournaments after taking up the sport five years ago following a trip to watch a game. \\"Seeing women involved in a contact sport, and witnessing the level of skill instantly made an impression on me,\\" she said. Jin Osborne says her involvement in sport to saved her life after she was diagnosed with a rare blood disease. The 34-year-old fitness instructor from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan is committed to helping women of all shapes and sizes to get active for the right reasons. \\"It's vital to stay physically active because your body needs it and depends on it. I found this out in the worst way,\\" Ms Osborne said. She added: \\"Attitudes to sport should be more about its health benefits and the fun and friendships that exercise brings as opposed to what it does to our physical appearance.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Sport Wales did a survey and found that more men were doing sports activities than women.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable?, using the article: Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and St Michael and All Angels..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to your friend's question is that John Douglas, the architect, showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable.

Le dysprosium se trouve généralement avec l'erbium, l'holmium et d'autres terres rares dans certains minerais comme le sable monazite. Translate to English.","output":"This translates to: \\"It's a reducer. Dysprosium is usually found with erbium, holmium, and other rare earths in certain ores like monazite sand.\\" To provide you with a more detailed explanation: Dysprosium is a chemical element represented by the symbol Dy in the Periodic Table. It belongs to the group of Lanthanides, which are often referred to as rare earth elements. Dysprosium is characterized as a metal that is soft, lustrous, and silvery-white. One of the properties of Dysprosium is that it serves as a reducing agent, which means it donates electrons to another species in a chemical reaction. This property is often applied in various chemical reactions, particularly in laboratories and industries. The statement also mentions that Dysprosium is usually found with Erbium and Holmium, which are also part of the rare earth elements. This is true as most of the rare earth elements are often bundled together in the Earth's crust, making their separation quite a complex process. Monazite sand is a significant source of these elements. Monazite is a reddish-brown phosphate mineral that contains rare earth metals. It is an important ore for thorium, lanthanum, and cerium and contains significant amounts of other rare earth elements. Because it is highly resistant to weathering, it often accumulates in placers along with ilmenite, rutile, quartz, hematite, and other heavy minerals. These are then mined for the extraction of the rare earth elements. Therefore, the original sentence in French indicates that Dysprosium, a reducer, is usually mined alongside other rare earth elements such as Erbium and Holmium from certain ores, including monazite sand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: who was identified as the lord of misrule??","output":"The Lord of Misrule is a term that has been used in different contexts and at different times in history, referring to a figure who presided over the chaos and revelry associated with festivals and celebrations. While there isn't one universally agreed-upon figure identified as the \\"lord of misrule,\\" the tradition typically involves the appointment of a person to oversee the festivities, games, and disorderly behavior during specific events. This individual would serve as the master of ceremonies or king for a day, presiding over wild revels that often included drinking, feasting, and the temporary inversion of social hierarchies. Here, we will cover multiple traditions where the Lord of Misrule appeared in history, each with its distinct context. 1. Ancient Rome: The concept of the Lord of Misrule can be traced back to the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was celebrated in late December. During these festivities, Romans would engage in feasting, gambling, and general debauchery in honor of the god Saturn. In this context, the Lord of Misrule would be referred to as the \\"Saturnalicius Princeps\\" or \\"master of the Saturnalia.\\" A person was elected to hold this position and was responsible for organizing the festivities and presiding over the chaos. 2. Medieval Europe: In Medieval Europe, the Lord of Misrule often presided over winter celebrations and the Feast of Fools, which took place around January 1. The tradition was particularly popular in England and France throughout the late Middle Ages. Appointments were typically made within religious or secular institutions, and the lords of misrule held their positions for a limited time, usually from All Saints' Day (November 1) to Candlemas (February 2). During this time, the established order was temporarily overturned, and the Lord of Misrule could command even high-ranking officials to perform whimsical tasks. 3. Renaissance England: The Lord of Misrule was particularly prominent in England during the Tudor era, with Henry VIII being a notable enthusiast of the tradition. The Lord of Misrule presided over the Christmas festivities at the English court and was responsible for organizing and overseeing various entertainments such as music, plays, and masquerades. This individual was often a courtier chosen by the reigning monarch to answer to the Lord of Misrule, and their duties typically extended from All Hallows' Eve to Twelfth Night. During this period, the Lord of Misrule represented a temporary inversion of the social hierarchy and an opportunity for people to vent frustrations through indulgence and chaotic behavior. 4. Modern Revivals: Although the role of the Lord of Misrule diminished over time, some modern revivals and reinterpretations of the tradition still occur. For example, during the Mardi Gras Carnival season in New Orleans, the 'King of Mardi Gras' or 'Rex' shares some similarities with the Lord of Misrule, acting as a figurehead for the wild celebrations that are an essential part of the festival. In conclusion, the Lord of Misrule represents a figure that embodies misrule and chaos, temporarily overthrowing established social order and presiding over wild, disorderly, and indulgent celebrations. Different figures identified as the Lord of Misrule have appeared and evolved throughout human history, primarily associated with ancient Roman festivals, Medieval and Renaissance European winter celebrations, and even some modern festivities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a short story: A scientist is playing with a wind-up monkey when he notices that it goes faster over one surface than another. The surface with the most friction is (A) a marble countertop (B) a cedar coffee table.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"a marble counter\\" and  \\"cedar coffee table\\"? A:","output":"The most sensible answer between \\"a marble counter\\" and \\"cedar coffee table\\" in terms of the surface with the most friction would be (B) a cedar coffee table. To elaborate, friction is a force that acts between two surfaces in contact with each other, resisting their relative motion. The amount of friction is generally influenced by the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces in contact. In general, the frictional force is greater between rough surfaces and lower between smoother surfaces. Let's examine each of the two surfaces mentioned: A) A marble countertop is a surface typically made from the metamorphic rock, marble. Marble is often polished to create an extremely smooth texture, which is a desirable quality for kitchen countertops. The polishing process involved in creating marble countertops reduces the surface roughness and, consequently, the friction between objects in contact with it. B) A cedar coffee table, on the other hand, is generally made from cedarwood. Although cedarwood is considered a softwood, it has a natural rough texture. Wood surfaces, in general, tend to have a higher friction coefficient due to the presence of microscopic grooves and fibers on the surface. Furthermore, a coffee table is less likely to be polished as smooth as a marble countertop. The natural characteristics of cedarwood and any potential lack of polishing contribute to a higher surface roughness, leading to greater friction between the cedar coffee table and any object that comes in contact with it, such as the wind-up monkey. Considering these factors, it is logical to conclude that the wind-up monkey would experience a higher level of friction on a cedar coffee table (B) than on a marble countertop (A). Thus, the most sensible answer is (B) a cedar coffee table."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Translate to English","output":"In this regard, they develop action plans in the field of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy refers to the production and consumption of energy resources in a manner that is environmentally friendly, economically feasible, and socially acceptable. The concept encompasses a wide range of energy sources, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies designed to minimize the negative impacts of energy generation on the planet. As countries around the world look for ways to address pressing global challenges such as climate change, air pollution, and energy security, many have turned to the adoption of sustainable energy action plans. These plans serve as blueprints for how a country or region can transition to a more sustainable energy future, with specific goals, targets, and strategies outlined for achieving these objectives. The plans often address multiple challenges simultaneously, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy security, and supporting economic growth and social welfare. In developing sustainable energy action plans, governments and organizations typically follow several key steps: 1. Assessment of the current energy situation: This involves an in-depth analysis of current energy use patterns, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks, as well as an evaluation of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of existing energy systems. 2. Identification of opportunities: Based on the initial assessment, stakeholders identify potential areas for improvement, such as energy efficiency measures, renewable energy deployment, or grid modernization. 3. Setting of objectives and targets: The plan establishes clear, measurable goals and targets for increasing the share of sustainable energy in the overall energy mix, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving energy security, among other aims. 4. Development of strategies and policies: The action plan outlines specific policies, programs, and initiatives that will help achieve the set objectives and targets. These may include financial incentives, regulatory changes, or public awareness campaigns, among others. 5. Implementation and monitoring: Once the plan has been finalized, it is implemented, and progress towards the set goals is monitored and reported on a regular basis. This allows for adjustments to be made as needed in response to changing circumstances or new information. 6. Evaluation and revision: Periodic evaluations of the plan's effectiveness are conducted, and any necessary revisions are made to ensure that the goals and objectives remain relevant and achievable. Sustainable energy action plans vary in scope and complexity, depending on the specific needs and resources of the country or region in question. However, regardless of the particulars, these plans play a crucial role in guiding the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and sustainable energy future. By taking a holistic, long-term approach to energy policy, sustainable energy action plans can support not only environmental goals but also help drive economic growth and social well-being for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Why will stress be detrimental to a person? === The answer to the above question is Options: [-] not enough information. [-] Not allowing time for recovery. [-] Focusing on varied and interesting life experiences. [-] Allowing it to be a part of life balance. Answer:","output":"Not allowing time for recovery.  Stress can be detrimental to a person when it becomes relentless and constant, with no room for recovery and replenishment of one's mental and physical resources. While a certain amount of stress is necessary for growth and development, chronic stress can lead to burnout, negatively impacting both personal and professional life. When stress is not managed effectively and recovery time is neglected, the individual's mind and body constantly operate under pressure. This constant state of tension can result in several adverse consequences, including: 1. Physical health problems: Prolonged stress can cause a variety of health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and weakened immune system. 2. Mental health problems: Chronic stress can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and even an increased risk of developing more severe psychiatric disorders. 3. Decreased productivity: When stress is not kept in check, it can impair one's focus, creativity, and ability to make sound decisions, which can negatively affect job performance and personal life. 4. Relationship issues: Persistent stress can cause a strain on relationships, leading to conflicts, miscommunication, and emotional disconnection from loved ones. 5. Lowered life satisfaction: Living in a state of constant stress can diminish overall happiness, as the individual may feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to enjoy life's simple pleasures. The key to preventing the harmful effects of stress is finding a balance between work and personal life, allowing ample time and opportunity for recovery and self-care. By actively managing stress and nurturing a balanced lifestyle filled with varied and interesting experiences, individuals can safeguard their mental and emotional well-being while still achieving professional success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: 1004 = 83 * d - 476 - 1176 First, let's deal with those big numbers. We will add 476 and 1176 together: 476 + 1176 = 1652 Now, our equation will look like: 1004 = 83 * d - 1652 Next, we want to get rid of the 1652 on the right side of the equation. So, we should add 1652 to both sides: 1004 + 1652 = 83 * d  2656 = 83 * d Now, we just have to find out what \\"d\\" is. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 83: 2656 / 83 = 83 * d / 83 32 = d There you go! The answer is d = 32.

Movie title: Silverado Context: The story opens with a man sleeping in a remote cabin in the Old American West. The door to the cabin bursts open and a gunman enters, shooting at the sleeping man, who is barely able to grab his pistol and shoot back, killing his would-be killer. The man continues to aim at the sides of the cabin and shoots another man walking outside. Repeated shotgun blasts blow through the roof of the cabin but the man is out of shots for his revolver. He tosses the revolver at the wood burning stove in the cabin and distracts the roof shooter long enough to grab his Winchester rifle. He shoots upward and hits the roof shooter, who falls into the cabin. The man with the rifle, Emmett (Scott Glenn), walks outside and looks over the failed assassins. He also looks at the horses, seeing a familiar brand emblem. Emmett leaves the cabin and continues his journey.Far out in the desert, he comes across another man, lying on the ground in his long underwear. He gives the man some water and takes him along. Later, as they camp for the night, the man in the underwear tells Emmett that his name is Paden (Kevin Kline) and that he'd been riding with a group of men who looted him and stole his horse. The two stop at an Army outpost where Emmett gives Paden some money to buy proper clothing. Paden suddenly spots his horse and the man who stole it. He ducks into the nearby general store where he has an argument with the shopkeep. Paden wants to borrow a pistol but the clerk won't let him. Paden asks the man for a gun worth the money Emmett gave him and is given a rusty old pistol that the cylinder falls out of. Paden rushes out to the square and loads the gun; he is spotted almost immediately by the horse thief, who rides toward him, shooting. Paden takes quick but very careful aim and shoots the man off the horse. A few minutes later, while he kisses his horse, Paden is grilled by a US Army sergeant about the shooting. Paden tells the lieutenant to look at the underside of his saddle, where his name is etched. When the lieutenant asks...

However, this statement is insufficient to draw a direct conclusion about the reason behind their liking. To analyze the hypothesis \\"People like my amazing personality,\\" it's important to consider all the potential factors that contribute to people liking the individual. While an amazing personality could very well be one of those factors, there might also be other reasons that influence this affection. For example, people might like the individual for their physical attractiveness, the way they dress, their sense of humor, their kindness, or any number of attributes that are unrelated to their personality. Additionally, relationships may also be influenced by situations and circumstances, such as common interests, shared experiences, or being in the same social group.

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up.

In Nigeria, Oil Spills Are a Longtime Scourge Perhaps no place on earth has been as battered by oil, experts say, leaving residents here astonished at the nonstop attention paid to the gusher half a world away in the Gulf of Mexico. It was only a few weeks ago, they say, that a burst pipe belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the mangroves was finally shut after flowing for two months: now nothing living moves in a black-and-brown world once teeming with shrimp and crab. Not far away, there is still black crude on Gio Creek from an April spill, and just across the state line in Akwa Ibom the fishermen curse their oil-blackened nets, doubly useless in a barren sea buffeted by a spill from an offshore Exxon Mobil pipe in May that lasted for weeks. The oil spews from rusted and aging pipes, unchecked by what analysts say is ineffectual or collusive regulation, and abetted by deficient maintenance and sabotage. In the face of this black tide is an infrequent protest — soldiers guarding an Exxon Mobil site beat women who were demonstrating last month, according to witnesses — but mostly resentful resignation. Small children swim in the polluted estuary here, fishermen take their skiffs out ever farther — “There’s nothing we can catch here,” said Pius Doron, perched anxiously over his boat — and market women trudge through oily streams. “There is Shell oil on my body,” said Hannah Baage, emerging from Gio Creek with a machete to cut the cassava stalks balanced on her head. That the Gulf of Mexico disaster has transfixed a country and president they so admire is a matter of wonder for people here, living among the palm-fringed estuaries in conditions as abject as any in Nigeria, according to the United Nations. Though their region contributes nearly 80 percent of the government’s revenue, they have hardly benefited from it; life expectancy is the lowest in Nigeria. “President Obama is worried about that one,” Claytus Kanyie, a local official, said of the gulf spill, standing among dead mangroves in the soft oily muck outside Bodo. “Nobody is worried about this one. The aquatic life of our people is dying off. There used be shrimp. There are no longer any shrimp.” In the distance, smoke rose from what Mr. Kanyie and environmental activists said was an illegal refining business run by local oil thieves and protected, they said, by Nigerian security forces. The swamp was deserted and quiet, without even bird song; before the spills, Mr. Kanyie said, women from Bodo earned a living gathering mollusks and shellfish among the mangroves. With new estimates that as many as 2.5 million gallons of oil could be spilling into the Gulf of Mexico each day, the Niger Delta has suddenly become a cautionary tale for the United States. As many as 546 million gallons of oil spilled into the Niger Delta over the last five decades, or nearly 11 million gallons a year, a team of experts for the Nigerian government and international and local environmental groups concluded in a 2006 report. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 dumped an estimated 10.8 million gallons of oil into the waters off Alaska. So the people here cast a jaundiced, if sympathetic, eye at the spill in the gulf. “We’re sorry for them, but it’s what’s been happening to us for 50 years,” said Emman Mbong, an official in Eket. The spills here are all the more devastating because this ecologically sensitive wetlands region, the source of 10 percent of American oil imports, has most of Africa’s mangroves and, like the Louisiana coast, has fed the interior for generations with its abundance of fish, shellfish, wildlife and crops. Local environmentalists have been denouncing the spoliation for years, with little effect. “It’s a dead environment,” said Patrick Naagbanton of the Center for Environment, Human Rights and Development in Port Harcourt, the leading city of the oil region. Though much here has been destroyed, much remains, with large expanses of vibrant green. Environmentalists say that with intensive restoration, the Niger Delta could again be what it once was. Nigeria produced more than two million barrels of oil a day last year, and in over 50 years thousands of miles of pipes have been laid through the swamps. Shell, the major player, has operations on thousands of square miles of territory, according to Amnesty International. Aging columns of oil-well valves, known as Christmas trees, pop up improbably in clearings among the palm trees. Oil sometimes shoots out of them, even if the wells are defunct. “The oil was just shooting up in the air, and it goes up in the sky,” said Amstel M. Gbarakpor, youth president in Kegbara Dere, recalling the spill in April at Gio Creek. “It took them three weeks to secure this well.” How much of the spillage is due to oil thieves or to sabotage linked to the militant movement active in the Niger Delta, and how much stems from poorly maintained and aging pipes, is a matter of fierce dispute among communities, environmentalists and the oil companies. Caroline Wittgen, a spokeswoman for Shell in Lagos, said, “We don’t discuss individual spills,” but argued that the “vast majority” were caused by sabotage or theft, with only 2 percent due to equipment failure or human error. “We do not believe that we behave irresponsibly, but we do operate in a unique environment where security and lawlessness are major problems,” Ms. Wittgen said. Oil companies also contend that they clean up much of what is lost. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil in Lagos, Nigel A. Cookey-Gam, said that the company’s recent offshore spill leaked only about 8,400 gallons and that “this was effectively cleaned up.” But many experts and local officials say the companies attribute too much to sabotage, to lessen their culpability. Richard Steiner, a consultant on oil spills, concluded in a 2008 report that historically “the pipeline failure rate in Nigeria is many times that found elsewhere in the world,” and he noted that even Shell acknowledged “almost every year” a spill due to a corroded pipeline. On the beach at Ibeno, the few fishermen were glum. Far out to sea oil had spilled for weeks from the Exxon Mobil pipe. “We can’t see where to fish; oil is in the sea,” Patrick Okoni said. “We don’t have an international media to cover us, so nobody cares about it,” said Mr. Mbong, in nearby Eket. “Whatever cry we cry is not heard outside of here.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article highlights the devastating impact of oil spills in Nigeria's Niger Delta, which has faced severe pollution for decades due to oil extraction and spills. The situation is exacerbated by aging infrastructure, ineffective regulation, and sabotage. The local population experiences little to no benefit from the oil revenue despite their region contributing nearly 80% of the government's revenue. The pollution has destroyed the once-abundant local marine life, with shrimp and crab populations disappearing. Environmentalists argue that there is potential for restoration with intensive efforts, but the issue remains largely unaddressed, sparking resentment and resignation amongst the local communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister? is inside the article: Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle.

News article: The Senate just voted to roll back your online privacy protections. Speak up now to keep the House from doing the same thing.      ISPs have been lobbying for weeks to get lawmakers to repeal the FCC’s rules that stand between them and using even creepier ways to track and profit off of your every move online. Republicans in the Senate just voted 50-48 (with two absent votes) to approve a Congressional Review Action resolution from Sen. Jeff Flake which—if it makes it through the House—would not only roll back the FCC’s rules but also prevent the FCC from writing similar rules in the future.      That would be a crushing loss for online privacy. ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldn’t be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent.      We can still kill this in the House: call your lawmakers today and tell them to protect your privacy from your ISP. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      March 23, 2017, 11:36 PM GMT / Updated March 23, 2017, 11:42 PM GMT By Alex Johnson      The Senate took the first step Thursday toward blocking rules that would restrict how some big tech companies share and sell your personal data, a prospect that digital activists said would be a huge loss for online privacy.      On a party-line vote of 50-48, the Senate passed a joint resolution that would bar the Federal Communications Commission from enforcing rules it approved last year — when it was under Democratic control — that sought to ban internet service providers like cable and cellphone companies from selling your data without your consent.      AP      The vote has little immediate impact: The measure would have to pass the House and be signed by President Donald Trump before it could become law. No timetable for House action has been set. In the meantime, the FCC rules that the measure would overturn aren't scheduled to go into effect until December.      If it becomes law, the measure, in effect, would preserve a two-track regulatory system that treats ISPs — the companies that connect you to the internet, which are overseen by the FCC — differently from web companies like Google and Facebook, which are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.      The rules passed last year by the Democratic majority on the FCC would require ISPs to ask you explicitly to \\"opt in\\" to letting them share personal information. On web-based ad networks, data sharing is usually turned on by default and you have to dig through menus and setting and opt out of it.      Related: How the Trump Administration Could Reshape the Internet      Here's why that's important: Just by themselves, Google and Facebook take in 54 percent to 60 percent of all U.S. digital ad revenue, depending on who's doing the counting.      More tellingly, Google and Facebook snapped up 90 percent of all new online ad spending in the first half of 2016, the last period for which complete figures are available, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S. for the Internet Advertising Bureau.      That leaves everybody else to fight it out for the remaining 10 percent of new ad spending. And the big cable and phone companies said the Senate vote was a step toward keeping that tiny playing field somewhat level.      CTIA, formerly the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, applauded the measure's sponsors Thursday for \\"seeking a common-sense and harmonized approach to protecting Americans' privacy.\\"      \\"Wireless carriers are committed to safeguarding consumer privacy, and we support regulatory clarity and uniformity across our digital economy,\\" it said in a statement.      Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the newly Republican-led FCC, also welcomed the Senate vote, telling reporters afterward: \\"My own core goal is to make sure that [the] uniform expectation of privacy is vindicated through the use of a regulatory framework that establishes a more level playing field.\\"      But advocates for online privacy slammed the vote.      Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel specializing in surveillance and privacy issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Senate was content to \\"sacrifice the privacy rights of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon.\\"      (NBC News is a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp., the nation's largest cable provider.)      MACH: Protecting Your Internet Presence in the Age of Donald Trump      Others noted that the measure would also bar the FCC from advancing \\"substantially similar\\" rules in the future, which Kate Tummarello, a policy analyst for the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said \\"would be a crushing loss for online privacy.\\"      \\"ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online,\\" Tummarello said. \\"They shouldn't be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase and more without your consent.\\"      They were joined by Mignon Clyburn, the only Democratic member of the FCC, who said the Senate measure would \\"frustrate the FCC's future efforts to protect the privacy of voice and broadband customers.\\"      The vote, she said, opens up \\"a massive gap in consumer protection law.\\" ||||| The US Senate yesterday voted to eliminate privacy rules that would have forced ISPs to get your consent before selling Web browsing history and app usage history to advertisers. Within a week, the House of Representatives could follow suit, and the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission last year would be eliminated by Congress.      So what has changed for Internet users? In one sense, nothing changed this week, because the requirement to obtain customer consent before sharing or selling data is not scheduled to take effect until at least December 4, 2017. ISPs didn’t have to follow the rules yesterday or the day before, and they won’t ever have to follow them if the rules are eliminated.      But the Senate vote is nonetheless one big step toward a major victory for ISPs, one that would give them legal certainty if they continue to make aggressive moves into the advertising market. The Senate vote invoked the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress eliminate regulations it doesn't like and prevent the agency from issuing similar regulations in the future. For ISPs, this is better than the FCC undoing its own rules, because it means a future FCC won't be able to reinstate them.      Unless the House or President Donald Trump oppose the Senate's action, ISPs will not have to worry about any strong privacy rules getting in the way of using your browsing history for profit. There won’t be any specific rules requiring them to get opt-in consent before sharing browsing history, even if that data is related to just one customer instead of being aggregated with other customers’ data in order to anonymize it.      Senate Democrats warned before yesterday’s vote that ISPs will be able to “draw a map” of where families shop and go to school, detect health information by seeing which illnesses they use the Internet to gather information on, and build profiles of customers' listening and viewing history.      The Senate vote was 50-48, with every Republican senator voting to kill privacy rules and every Democratic senator voting to preserve them.      ISPs can’t see encrypted traffic, so if you visit an HTTPS site, ISPs will see only the domain (like https://arstechnica.com) rather than each page you visit. But that’s still plenty, said Dallas Harris, an attorney who specializes in broadband privacy and is a policy fellow at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.      ISPs might be able to figure out where you bank, your political views, and your sexual orientation based on what sites you visit, Harris told Ars.      “You don’t need to see the contents of every communication” to develop efficient ad tracking mechanisms, she said. \\"The fact that you’re looking at a website can reveal when you’re home, when you’re not home.”      An ISP might notice that a particular tablet often visits children’s websites. From that, “they can infer that this tablet then belongs to a child” and deliver advertising targeted to kids. “The level of information that they can figure out is beyond what even most customers expect,” Harris said.      How the rules have changed      The legal changes all stem from the FCC's decision in February 2015 to reclassify home and mobile ISPs as common carriers. The reclassification had numerous effects: it allowed the FCC to impose net neutrality rules, but it also stripped the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over ISPs because the FTC's charter from Congress prohibits the agency from regulating common carriers.      Before the February 2015 reclassification, ISPs could have been punished by the FTC for violating customers' privacy. But following the FTC rules wasn't too onerous—the FTC recommends opt-in consent before selling or sharing the most sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, the content of communications, financial and health information, information about children, and precise geo-location data. But ISPs could use an opt-out system for everything else, including Web browsing and app usage history.      ISPs “want to be the advertising powerhouse.”      The FCC's reclassification of ISPs removed FTC authority but imposed privacy requirements from Title II, Section 222 of the Communications Act. The problem is that Section 222 was written in 1996 for telephone service, so the FCC said it would write new broadband-specific rules explaining exactly how Section 222 would be enforced on ISPs. Those rules, including the opt-in requirements, were finalized in October 2016.      Theoretically, Congress and the FCC could return jurisdiction to the FTC by eliminating the privacy rules and eliminating the ISPs' common carrier classification. But even that might not work, because a federal appeals court ruling in August 2016 said that any company with a common carrier business cannot be regulated by the FTC at all, even when they're offering non-common carrier services. The common carrier designation is also used for landline phone and mobile voice service; that means ISPs like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint could be entirely exempt from FTC oversight. Comcast and other cable companies are only common carriers for Internet service because their VoIP phones are regulated differently, so they could more easily go back under FTC oversight.      But even if the FTC regains jurisdiction, its guidelines are weaker than the FCC's privacy rules. Thus, yesterday's Senate vote could leave us with no rules preventing ISPs from selling your Web browsing histories to advertisers and data brokers without obtaining opt-in consent.      When AT&T charged extra for privacy      The most prominent example of an ISP monetizing customers' browsing history comes from AT&T. Starting in 2013, AT&T charged fiber Internet customers at least 29 extra each month unless they opted in to a system that scanned customers' Internet traffic in order to deliver personalized ads.      AT&T killed this \\"Internet Preferences\\" program shortly before the FCC finalized its privacy rules. But that doesn't mean ISPs are giving up on advertising.      ISPs “want to be the advertising powerhouse, which is why they fought so hard against these rules,” Harris said. “They want to compete with Google and Facebook and other edge providers in the advertising space. This is going to be their new frontier, a new way for them to increase their profits.”      ISP lobby groups have argued that privacy rules would prevent them from showing Internet users more relevant advertising via “data-driven services” and would prevent ISPs from competing in the online advertising market. They’ve argued that Web browsing and app usage history should not be classified as “sensitive” information.      Advertising lobby groups, knowing that they could end up working more closely with ISPs, recently thanked Republican lawmakers for taking steps to kill the privacy rules.      AT&T sells advertising via its AdWorks division, which boasts of “more targeted” ads to “more screens,” via TV set-top boxes and online video. Comcast sells online advertising that can appear on xfinity.com and NBC sites. Verizon boosted its online advertising technology when it purchased AOL and is trying to finalize a purchase of Yahoo.      Because these ISPs operate their own advertising networks, they don't need to share individuals' browsing history with third parties in order to serve targeted ads. But they can use customers' browsing history to sell targeted ads. Businesses would pay the ISPs to have their advertising reach people who are more likely to buy their products, but only the ISPs would know exactly who those customers are.      “They’ve already begun marketing [to advertisers], explaining how they have the ability to track you on four devices,” Harris said. “Because they’re also your cable [TV] providers, they can combine what you’re watching on TV with what you’re doing on the Internet and looking at on your phones and your tablets. They’re heavily invested in this idea that they have a lot of data that can be valuable to advertisers and want to build up that part of their business.”      For ISPs that don't operate their own ad networks, getting into the targeted advertising business could involve sharing customers' browsing with third parties. The FCC privacy rules would have prevented both the internal use and sharing of such information without opt-in consent. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The US Senate has voted to abolish privacy rules which would have required internet service providers (ISPs) to secure customers’ permission before selling their web browsing history and app usage history to advertisers. The legislation, designed to protect customers’ privacy, was scheduled to take effect in December. The measure abolishing the rules must now pass through the House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The Congressional Review Act invoked by the Senate could enable the latter to prevent any subsequent adoption of similar regulations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0?  Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. To elaborate on the reasoning behind this conclusion, we need to consider the calorie intake for each group, the storage of unused energy as fat, and the general context of obesity and BMI. Group Brown consumed 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, which translates to a significant amount of additional energy intake. As mentioned in the hint, any unused energy in food, irrespective of its source, is stored as fat in the body. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in storing almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. On the other hand, Group Yellow maintained a normal diet, which indicates that their calorie intake was likely appropriate for their energy needs. Consequently, they would not have experienced the excessive energy storage that Group Brown did, resulting in lesser fat accumulation in their body. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m2 or higher, and it increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. BMI is an estimate of the fat content in the body, calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person's height (in meters). Given that Group Brown consumed more energy than they required daily and stored these unused calories as fat, they are predisposed to a higher likelihood of gaining weight and increasing their BMI. In comparison, Group Yellow, with their normal diet, would not face the same risk of excessive weight gain and elevated BMI levels. Therefore, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Anorexia becomes common in males.\\"?","output":"Based on the given paragraph, we cannot conclusively state that \\"Anorexia becomes common in males.\\" The information provided in the paragraph only states that anorexia in males accounted for approximately six percent of cases seen in an eating disorder clinic. This data needs to be analyzed in context with other relevant information on anorexia to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of anorexia in males. Anorexia is a serious eating disorder that affects both males and females. It is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, and extreme food restriction leading to significantly low body weight. In general, eating disorders are typically more prevalent in females, but cases among males also exist. The paragraph cites that around six percent of the cases seen in an eating disorder clinic were male. This figure indicates that males do indeed experience anorexia and seek treatment for it. However, to determine if anorexia is becoming common in males, we need to consider multiple factors and a wider range of statistics, such as: 1. Prevalence rates of anorexia among males in different age groups, geographic locations, and cultural backgrounds. 2. Comparisons between prevalence rates of anorexia in males and in females. 3. Trends or changes in these prevalence rates over time. Are the numbers rising, falling, or remaining steady? Furthermore, it would be helpful to analyze the contributing factors for anorexia in both genders to determine if there are any unique risk factors or protective factors associated with males. Investigating potential influences such as biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors will assist in painting a more complete and accurate picture of the prevalence of anorexia in males. In conclusion, the given paragraph highlights that anorexia is not exclusive to females and that males accounted for six percent of cases seen in an eating disorder clinic. However, this information alone does not allow us to definitively conclude that anorexia is becoming common in males. Further investigation, analysis, and contextualization of various factors and prevalence rates among different populations are required to more adequately assess the current state and trends of anorexia among males."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a \\"table\\" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing \\"sparse\\" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or relations), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed. Data may be freely inserted, deleted and edited in these tables, with the DBMS doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application/user. Who proposed using a table to store data?","output":"Dr. Edgar F. Codd, a British computer scientist, proposed using a table to store data in his seminal paper on the relational model for database systems.

In Europa would the state of water in higher or lower denstiy than in Earth?  Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space. Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state.  Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. The answer is:","output":"The state of water in Europa is at a lower density than on Earth. The explanation for this lies in the differences between the water states on each celestial body. On Earth, water exists predominantly in its liquid state due to its high boiling point, which is a result of hydrogen bonds. These bonds give water the ability to support life, as liquid water is essential for all living organisms. On the other hand, water on Jupiter's moon Europa exists in a frozen state. When water freezes, its hydrogen bonds cause it to expand, leading to ice having a lower density (mass/volume) compared to liquid water. This is why ice floats on top of water, such as in lakes during winter, creating a habitat for aquatic life like fish to survive beneath the ice layer.  As the water on Europa is primarily in its frozen state, its overall density is lower than that of liquid water on Earth. This difference in density results from the distinct impact of hydrogen bonds on water when it is in its frozen state compared to its liquid state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto as he tries to clarify his past comments about Mexico and immigration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto as he tries to clarify his past comments about Mexico and immigration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)      Donald Trump will travel to Mexico City on Wednesday for a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, just hours before he delivers a high-stakes speech in Arizona to clarify his views on immigration policy.      Peña Nieto last Friday invited both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to visit Mexico, his office said in a statement provided to The Washington Post on Tuesday night.      Trump, sensing an opportunity, decided over the weekend to accept the invitation and push for a visit this week, according to the people in the United States and Mexico familiar with the discussions.      Late Tuesday, Trump and the Mexican president confirmed on Twitter that they will meet Wednesday.      “I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow,” Trump wrote Tuesday night. Shortly after, Peña Nieto’s office wrote that “El Señor” Donald Trump has accepted the invitation and will meet privately on Wednesday with Peña Nieto.      1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × How Mexicans are reacting to Trump’s rhetoric View Photos Politicians, comedians, artists and developers hit back at Trump’s inflammatory speech.

Peña Nieto later tweeted that he believes in dialogue in order to “promote the interests of Mexico in the world and, principally, to protect Mexicans wherever they are.”      The visit comes after Trump has wavered for weeks on whether he will continue to hold his hard-line positions on the central and incendiary issue of his campaign, in particular his call to deport an estimated 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally.      The people informed of Trump’s plans spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the matter. They said earlier Tuesday that talks between the Trump campaign and Mexican officials were ongoing, with security concerns still being sorted out.      [Trump risks alienating voting blocs with wavering on immigration]      Trump is scheduled to hold fundraisers Wednesday morning in California and deliver his immigration speech in the evening at the Phoenix Convention Center. His trip to Mexico will come between his events.      The Clinton campaign shrugged off Trump’s trip as a distraction from his policies. “What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri, a senior Clinton campaign adviser, in a statement.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border if he wins the election. Here's what people living along the border have to say about that wall. (Zoeann Murphy,Samuel Granados,Kevin Schaul,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)      A Clinton campaign official confirmed that Clinton received a letter requesting an in-person meeting with the Mexican leader. Clinton has not yet accepted.      “Secretary Clinton last met with President Peña Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials,” the aide said. “She looks forward to talking with President Peña Nieto again at the appropriate time.”      The aide requested anonymity to discuss the potential meeting.      The invitation is a stunning move by Peña Nieto, given the grief that Trump’s campaign has caused the Mexican government over the past year. From calling Mexican illegal immigrants rapists and criminals, to vowing to build a wall along the Southern border, to threatening to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump has caused growing alarm in Mexico. Peña Nieto himself likened Trump’s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, in a March interview with a Mexican newspaper.      To the delight of his U.S. rally crowds, Trump has repeatedly promised to force Mexico to pay for his proposed border wall. Peña Nieto and other Mexican leaders have dismissed the idea as preposterous.      “There is no way that Mexico can pay [for] a wall like that,” Peña Nieto said in a July interview on CNN, adding that he did not agree with Trump’s frequent characterization of illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists and killers.      Trump’s newly installed campaign chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, played a key role in devising the Wednesday stop while Trump met Sunday with his aides and family at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., according to two people who have been briefed on the campaign’s deliberations.      Bannon, who previously headed the conservative website Breitbart News, made the case to the group that Trump must underscore his populist immigration views in the final weeks of the general-election campaign, perhaps with an audacious gesture.      [Donald Trump calls for ‘deportation force’ to remove undocumented immigrants]      Peña Nieto’s invitation was brought up, and Bannon said it offered Trump an opening to make headlines and showcase himself as a statesman who could deal directly with Mexico.      Trump was intrigued by Bannon’s proposal and agreed, but not all aides and allies were as enthusiastic, the people said.      Trump appointed Bannon to his post and veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager this month after sidelining campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who subsequently resigned. He has been navigating a flood of conflicting advice this summer about where to land on immigration as he has publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his position.      Following Sunday’s strategy session, plans came together quickly but not without hurdles and some tensions.      Early this week, representatives for Trump contacted the U.S. Embassy in Mexico about his intentions, according to a person in Mexico familiar with the communications between the two sides.      Trump’s representatives were told privately by officials that it would be logistically difficult for Trump to visit. But the businessman’s proxies insisted that Trump would not delay his plans, the person said.      Overseas visits by senior U.S. officials normally require weeks of intricate planning on both sides, as every movement and meeting is plotted. When more security is required, such trips become even more complicated.      Security staffs traveling with the visitor are usually beefed up. While Mexico is not considered a hostile place, the crime level is high, and Trump, should he appear in public, would require significant protection.      The invitation — and particularly a visit — seems certain to cause a backlash in Mexico City, where Trump is widely disliked. Mexicans have bashed Trump piñatas, burned him in effigy during public street parties and staged plays about him as a comic villain.      [Trump on undocumented immigrants: ‘We are going to get rid of the criminals’]      When Trump declared his candidacy in 2015, he was seen by many in Mexico as insulting but not to be taken very seriously. Mexican diplomats back then scoffed at the notion that Trump was a serious candidate or that the government was worried about his ascent.      That’s all changed now. Many of Mexico’s government and business elite have grown skittish about the potential of a Trump presidency and the economic damage that his policies might inflict. The United States is Mexico’s most important trading partner.      Earlier this year, Peña Nieto swapped out key diplomats, including the Mexican ambassador to the United States, to have a more aggressive presence advocating for the importance of a strong relationship between the two countries.      Several Mexican officials were surprised to learn on Tuesday that Peña Nieto had extended an invitation to Trump.      “Wow,” one said, when reached by The Post.      “This is an extraordinarily surprising, but welcome, development, whether it ends up happening or not,” said Andrew Selee, a Mexico expert at the Wilson Center in Washington. “Mexico is a vital country for U.S. foreign policy and economic interests. The second destination for exports and the country of origin of a tenth of all Americans.”      Several Mexican politicians were quick to criticize the meeting. Miguel Barbosa, an opposition senator with the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution, tweeted about Trump: “Your presence in Mexico is not welcome. Get out! You come to take a photo with those you’ve offended.”      “It is a political error by [Peña Nieto] to use this lying anti-Mexican,” Barbosa wrote in another tweet.      A Mexican presidential hopeful with the right-wing National Action Party, Margarita Zavala, tweeted that even though Trump was invited to Mexico, he was not welcome.      “Mexicans have dignity and we reject your discourse of hate,” she wrote.      Former Mexican president Vicente Fox tweeted “Adios, Trump!”      Trump’s Phoenix speech later Wednesday is expected to add to the day’s drama, with declarations by candidate about where exactly he stands on his immigration policy and border security.      Bannon and Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller have had a heavy influence over the speech’s contours, the people familiar with the campaign said. Miller is a former aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a Trump confidant who has urged him to hold to his tough positioning and rhetoric on immigration.      And while Trump’s associates have framed his speech and trip as presidential moves, the surprise gambit also fits his career-long tendency for theater and confrontation.      Partlow reported from Mexico City. Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. ||||| Republican presidential candidate – who wants to build a border wall – will meet Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday ahead of major immigration speech      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has confirmed that he will travel to Mexico on Wednesday to meet President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City.      Moments before taking the stage for a rally in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle, Trump tweeted that he had “accepted the invitation of President Enrique Peña Nieto, of Mexico, and look[ed] very much forward to meeting him tomorrow”.      Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.      The meeting will happen hours before Trump is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he will aim to clarify his increasingly murky stance on the issue.      It was confirmed by the official Twitter account for the Mexican presidency, which said:      Presidencia México (@PresidenciaMX) El Señor @realDonaldTrump ha aceptado esta invitación y se reunirá mañana en privado con el Presidente @EPN.      Translated, the tweet says that Trump “has accepted the invitation and will meet privately tomorrow with the president”.      Peña Nieto – who has previously compared Trump to Hitler and Mussolini – said via Twitter that he had invited both presidential candidates to Mexico “to discuss bilateral relations”, adding: “I believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto said he had invited Trump, despite having previously compared him to Hitler. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP      The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment. However, Josh Green, a reporter for Bloomberg News, said Trump would be accompanied on the trip by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions.      Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed Read more      Trump, who launched his campaign in 2015 with the announcement that Mexico was “bringing their worst people”, including “rapists”, to the US, had been scheduled to appear at fundraisers in California on Wednesday morning, before delivering his immigration address in Phoenix at 6pm local time (9pm ET).      The trip to Mexico City to meet Peña Nieto – who has previously invited Trump to debate him in Mexico – will likely occur sometime in the middle of the day.      The proposal was first broached with the US embassy in Mexico City earlier this week, a fast-tracking of an international visit by an American presidential candidate that is typically planned over the course of weeks.      In recent days, Trump has been increasingly vague on his position about the legal status of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the US. During the Republican primary, Trump appealed to the conservative base by calling for a “deportation force” to remove all undocumented immigrants from the country.      However, on a recent trip to Iowa, Trump said the policy issue was driven by the media. “In recent days, the media – as it usually does – has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,” he said at a fundraiser for Republican senator Joni Ernst.      In front of a crowd in Everett on Tuesday evening, Trump made no mention of his upcoming diplomatic mission, focusing instead on campaign speech favorites, including a rambling story in rhyming couplets about an ungrateful and poisonous snake, intended as an allegory about Muslim refugees to the US.      Also notably absent from the speech was perhaps Trump’s most essential motif: the wall he proposes to build along the US-Mexico border.      Trump’s approval ratings among Latino voters are historically bad, and his relationship with Peña Nieto’s government is even worse. Trump has long pledged to force Mexico to pay for the proposed 2,000-mile (3,220km) border wall, a suggestion the Mexican president responded to coldly.            “No way,” Peña Nieto told CNN earlier this year.      Peña Nieto has fallen on hard political times in recent months. The latest polls put his approval rating at just 23%, according to Mexico News Daily, as the president has been hit by personal scandals, as well as allegations of human rights abuses by police officers. Protests by teachers opposed to his educational reforms have led to widespread unrest and several deaths.      It is hard to see how inviting Trump to meet him would help Peña Nieto domestically, as Trump is, unsurprisingly, considerably less popular in Mexico than the president. In March, city legislators passed a non-legally binding bill to ban Trump from Mexico’s capital.      Peña Nieto’s predecessor, former president Vicente Fox, has been considerably more vocal in speaking out against the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s ideas “racist” and saying “I declare: I’m not going to pay for that fucking wall.”      Trump reveals plan to finance Mexico border wall with threat to cut off funds Read more      A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said the focus should remain on Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona. Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for Hillary for America, said: “From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as ‘rapists’ and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and US citizens. He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall. He has said we should ban remittances to families in Mexico if Mexico doesn’t pay up.      “What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.”      Launching his presidential bid last year, Trump claimed “the US has become a dumping ground for everyone else’s problems”, pointing the finger at Mexico.      “They’re sending us not the right people,” he said. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing their problems.      “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has accepted Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's invitation to visit Mexico on Wednesday, just hours before Trump is set to deliver a major immigration speech in which he is expected to clarify his stance on the issue.

The video shows militants chipping away at Hatra's walls, attacking carvings and statues with pickaxes and sledgehammers. In one scene, a militant wildly fires his automatic weapon at the growing debris and ruin. According to the Islamic State's puritanical creed, the \\"idols\\" of pre-Islamic civilizations are heretical, false images of divinity that must be destroyed. Iraqi authorities in March confirmed that the extremists had set about smashing and vandalizing a number of key ancient sites in the Nineveh plain, a region around the Iraqi city of Mosul that is steeped in centuries upon centuries of rich history. The international condemnation even led U.S. military officials to ponder some sort of targeted response to protect these antiquities. The Islamic State appears undeterred. \\"Islamic State has sent us to these idols to destroy them,\\" says one of the militants in the video, according to the Guardian. \\"Some of the infidel organizations say the destruction of these alleged artifacts is a war crime. We will destroy your artifacts and idols anywhere and Islamic State will rule your lands.\\" \\"Praise to God, who enabled us and the soldiers of Islamic State to remove the signs of polytheism,\\" says one Islamic State fighter toward the video's end. Until its ravaging at the hands of the extremists, Hatra was a remarkably well-preserved ancient site. It first rose to prominence in the 3rd century, probably as a garrison town for the Seleucid Empire, one of the quasi-Greek kingdoms that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great and the splintering of his short-lived empire in Asia. According to UNESCO's listing, Hatra bears the traces of a series of ancient cultures, including Roman influence as well as a succession of Persian empires. \\"The perfect condition of the double wall,\\" details the United Nations' cultural agency, \\"in an untouched environment sets it aside as an outstanding example\\" of the architecture of this period, more than 2,000 years old. That is, until the Islamic State and its brutish zealots reached the site. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post. He previously was a senior editor at TIME, based first in Hong Kong and later in New York.","output":"The bad people from a group called Islamic State broke many old and special things in a very old city called Hatra in Iraq.

Confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late-night gig - only to realise 4AM was the name of the band, not the starting time. Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’. The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm. 'Very confused': John Adams (left) and Joe Becket were baffled after council officials mistook their band name, 4AM, for a late-night stage time. Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council. She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers. 'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: \\"What on earth is this all about?\\". 'They wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and I was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life. 'I’m too old to stay up that late.' The duo, named 4am after a song by jazz legend Herbie Hancock, is made up of singer John Adams and drummer Joe Becket. Mr Adams said everyone was ‘very confused’ about the raid, adding: 'This has never happened to us before. Raided: Customers and staff at The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, were stunned to see police and council inspectors charge in. 'We’re called 4am after one of our favourite tracks by Herbie Hancock. That’s how we got the name, it’s from the album Mr Hands. 'When we were looking for a name that was our favourite album. We play stuff to get the ladies dancing, it’s all dance and soul.' Simon Freeman, 32, was at the gig when the raid took place - and said it was ‘totally ridiculous’. He said: 'These two police officers came in with these three guys from the council and they were very confrontational. 'You should have seen their faces when they realised the name of the band was 4am, not the time of the gig - they shot off with their tails between their legs. 'It will take quite a while for them to live this one down.' A spokesman for Spelthorne Borough Council admitted yesterday that its officers had made an error after spotting a poster for the gig earlier this month. He said: 'Following a visit to The Feathers, there was no cause for concern. The visit was carried out after seeing an advertisement which mentioned 4am. 'On investigation, this was part of the name of the band.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"Sure kiddo, let me simplify this funny story for you. There's a band named 4AM. Some people who work for the city saw a poster saying there was going to be \\"music from 4AM\\" at a village pub. They thought the pub was going to have music playing really late into the night, at 4 in the morning, which is not allowed. So they brought police officers to stop it. But, oops! Turns out that 4AM was actually the name of the band, not the time the music was going to start. The people from the city made a big mistake and everyone at the pub was really confused. They all had a good laugh about it afterwards, especially when the city workers left with embarrassed looks on their faces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with Miss Moneypenny and M at MI6 headquarters in London, under the shell corporation known as 'Universal Exports', discussing the whereabouts of MI6's best \\"00\\" agent, James Bond. Bond happens to be driving on a country coastal road in Portugal in his Aston-Martin when he's passed by a woman driving a Mercury Cougar. The woman drives to a nearby beach and tries to drown herself in the surf. When Bond drags her back, he is attacked by several thugs, whom he is able to beat in hand-to-hand combat. When he turns his attention back to the mysterious woman, he sees her driving off in her Cougar. Bond, puzzled by the turn of events, says \\"This never happened to the other fellow!\\", (presumably a reference to the departure of Sean Connery from the series).Later, at a casino, the same woman Bond found on the beach, Contessa Teresa \\"Tracy\\" di Vicenzo, is gambling and finds herself unable to pay her debt. Bond pays the tab for her and she invites him to her room to \\"repay\\" him. Bond is again attacked by another man, whom he beats. When he returns to his own room, Tracy is there waiting, steals Bond's pistol and threatens to kill him \\"for a thrill\\". Bond disarms her and demands to know about the man in her room; Tracy has no answer. Tracy leaves the hotel the next morning and when James tries to trail her, he is apprehended by several more men who take him to Tracy's father, Marc-Ange Draco, head of a powerful European crime organization which is called Union Course. The gangster offers Bond a sizable dowry if he'll marry his troubled daughter after he tells Bond about Tracy's suicial depression since her mother's death. Bond turns down the offer but agrees to continue dating Tracy if Draco will help him find SPECTRE's sinister leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, whom Bond has been unsuccessfully tracking for the past two years.When he returns to MI6 in London, M tells Bond that his obsession with finding Blofeld must end.

Fanny loved talking to Mary.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Fanny loved talking to Mary\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's analyze the sentence in detail to ensure both syntax and semantics are adhered to: 1. Syntax: Syntax in a sentence refers to the grammatical rules and structure that dictate how words are combined to create meaningful phrases, clauses, and sentences. A sentence must follow basic rules of syntax, such as subject-verb agreement, coherent word order, and proper tense usage, to be considered acceptable. Let's examine the sentence elements: - Subject: \\"Fanny\\" - It is a proper noun, which serves as the main subject of the sentence. It provides information on the person who is engaging in the action mentioned. - Verb: \\"loved\\" - This verb acts as the predicate of the sentence, which describes the action the subject performs. In this case, we have the past simple tense of the verb \\"love,\\" which indicates a completed action or a general preference in the past. - Gerund: \\"talking\\" - Derived from the verb \\"talk,\\" it functions as a noun to describe the activity that Fanny loved. - Preposition: \\"to\\" - This preposition indicates a direction or the recipient of the action of the verb. It connects the object of the sentence, \\"Mary,\\" with the gerund \\"talking.\\" - Object: \\"Mary\\" - Another proper noun, which serves as the recipient of Fanny's action, making the sentence meaningful. The sentence features proper subject-verb agreement, correct word order, and appropriate tense usage, making it syntactically acceptable. 2. Semantics: Semantics refers to the meaning conveyed by words, phrases, and sentences. A semantically acceptable sentence should provide clear meaning, without contradictions or ambiguities. In the sentence \\"Fanny loved talking to Mary,\\" it is evident that the subject, Fanny, had a fondness for the specific activity of talking to another person - Mary. The meaning is clear and coherent, without any ambiguities or contradictions. There is a logical relationship between the words and the ideas they represent, which contributes to the overall meaning. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Fanny loved talking to Mary\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable as it adheres to grammatical rules and conveys a clear and coherent meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Options are:  (a). unsaturated hydrocarbons;  (b). complex carbohydrates;  (c). fossil fuels;  (d). saturated hydrocarbons; The answer is:","output":"(d). Saturated Hydrocarbons Hydrocarbons are organic compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The simplest kind of hydrocarbon compound belongs to the category of saturated hydrocarbons or alkanes.  Saturated hydrocarbons have all their carbon atoms linked to each other by single covalent bonds. They are termed \\"saturated\\" because every carbon atom's bonds are filled to capacity with hydrogen atoms, thus they can't bind to any more atoms. These compounds are generally stable and less reactive due to the presence of strong C-C single bonds and C-H bonds. The simplest hydrocarbons are Methane (CH4), Ethane (C2H6), Propane (C3H8) and Butane (C4H10). Methane is the simplest of them all with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. On the other hand, unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one carbon-carbon double or triple bond which makes them more reactive than saturated ones. Complex carbohydrates are long chains of sugar units and are not hydrocarbons. Similarly, Fossil fuels are a mixture of hydrocarbons but not the simplest form of hydrocarbons."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A week later, he attacked the village of Imafuku with 1,500 men, against a defending force of 600. With the aid of a squad wielding arquebuses, the shogunate forces claimed another victory. Several more small forts and villages were attacked before the siege of Osaka Castle itself began on 4 December. The Sanada-maru was an earthwork barbican defended by Sanada Yukimura and 7,000 men, on behalf of the Toyotomi. The Shogun's armies were repeatedly repelled, and Sanada and his men launched a number of attacks against the siege lines, breaking through thrice. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery  as well as men to dig under the walls. On 22 January the Winter Siege was ended, with Toyotomi Hideyori pledging to not rise in rebellion.

Firstly, let us consider the numerical differences in the shots taken by both individuals. By taking only five shots to achieve a specific goal, when Jon had taken 500 shots to achieve the same, \\"he\\" displays a significantly better result in comparison to Jon. In fact, there is a 100-fold difference in the number of shots taken by both. This disparity in their performance supports the hypothesis that \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could.\\" However, before drawing definitive conclusions, it is essential to consider the potential factors that can affect the results. Some of these factors could include: 1. Skill level: The person who took only five shots might have a higher skill level or is more experienced in the task than Jon, which would drastically impact the results' accuracy in supporting the hypothesis. 2. Context: The context in which these shots are taken is crucial, as it could provide critical information about the circumstances. For example, if Jon faced adverse conditions while attempting the task or was taking blindfolded shots, it might not be a fair comparison. 3. Repeated attempts: We must also consider whether this premise refers to a single instance or multiple instances. If it was a lone occurrence and \\"he\\" replicated this feat consistently, the hypothesis would be strongly supported. However, if Jon outperforms him on other occasions, the hypothesis might not be as solid. 4. Other external factors: Factors such as luck, equipment used, or psychological state are also worth considering while evaluating the hypothesis, as these can impact the overall performance of both individuals. In conclusion, based on the premise given, we can tentatively agree that the hypothesis \\"He shot and hit it way quicker than Jon could\\" is true.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"In a later symbol, we will return to the explanation of these cosmic spiral sections. As we delve deeper into the understanding of cosmic spirals and their sections, it is essential to note that these fascinating formations are among the many wonders of the universe. Cosmic spirals can be found in various celestial bodies, including galaxies and planetary systems, and they have a significant influence on the formation, structure, and evolution of the cosmos. Cosmic spiral sections, which can be observed and studied through varying symbols, serve as a visual representation of these spirals. These sections provide important information about the geometry, dynamics, and interactions within the spiral structures. Understanding the intricacies of these sections will enable us to gain a better grasp of the forces governing the universe and our place within it. To comprehend the concepts behind cosmic spirals and their sections further, let’s look at some fundamental ideas: 1. Formation and structure: Spiral galaxies, such as the Milky Way, exhibit a flat, rotating disk containing a mixture of stars, gas, and dust. This disk displays a spiral pattern that can extend outward from the central nucleus, creating a series of spiral arms that are separated by gaps. The exact process involved in the formation of these spiral structures is still a point of active research and remains somewhat of a mystery. 2. Dynamics: The spiral patterns visible in galaxies are not static features; instead, they are continually changing and evolving. The motion of stars and interstellar material within these spiral arms is influenced by various forces, such as gravity, galactic rotation, and the presence of dark matter. Understanding how these forces interact within the cosmic spiral sections will provide insight into the mechanics governing these structures. 3. Wave patterns and resonances: One popular theory for the formation of spiral arms in galaxies is the density wave theory. According to this concept, spiral arms are the result of density waves propagating through the galactic disk. These waves trigger the formation of new stars and aggregations of matter within the spiral arms. The resonance between these density waves and the motions of individual celestial bodies within the spiral sections contributes to the maintenance and development of the spiral pattern. When we return to the explanation of cosmic spiral sections at a later point, it is crucial to explore these key points and other factors that contribute to the vast complexities of the universe. By examining the science behind these fascinating phenomena, we will continuously enrich our knowledge of the cosmos and the many intricacies of its structure."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage  \\"Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for \\"comics\\" in different languages.

By sitting on exercise balls instead of chairs , teachers find students' posture  and attention improve. Dottie Pownall, a fifth-grade teacher in West Virginia, USA, has been using balls as chairs since December 2008. \\"The students love them\\", she says. Pownall took a survey  of her students. She found that 80% of the students thought sitting on the balls helped them pay more attention to what they were learning. The teacher, Pisa Witt, felt so strongly about the use of balls as chairs, she started Witt Fitt. This company encourages the use of the balls. And the company educates not only teachers but also students on how to use them. \\"Our products are used in 24 states, three provinces in Canada, Puerto Rico   and Japan,\\" says Witt, \\" Research shows that sitting on the balls makes them sit up straighter .

Here are some concepts: building, function, wall What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"A building is essentially a man-made structure used for various purposes, ranging from residential to commercial, industrial to public utility. The concept of a building can encompass various forms, such as houses, skyscrapers, schools, hospitals, churches, factories, and more. It's an enclosed space that provides shelter, security, and comfort, where people can live, work, learn, and perform other activities. The primary function of a building varies according to its design and purpose. Some buildings are designed for residence such as houses, apartments, or condominiums, while others are made for commercial purposes like offices, shops, and malls. There are also buildings specifically designed for industrial use like factories and warehouses; and for public and community purposes such as schools, hospitals, churches, and government institutions. Moreover, buildings can also serve secondary functions, like a residential building may also accommodate a home office or a commercial building may include residential areas. So the function of a building is mainly determined by human needs and societal demands. One of the vital elements in a building is the wall. Walls function as a physical and sometimes visual divider between different spaces. They give form to the building, separate interior spaces, support the roof and, sometimes, upper floors of the building. Walls also play a significant role in controlling the indoor climate of a building. They are designed to prevent the entry of rain, wind, heat, or cold into the building. Moreover, walls are usually designed to resist lateral forces that could cause the building to collapse. They also provide privacy, security, and prevent the spread of fire. Furthermore, they often accommodate important building functions such as insulation, included utilities like plumbing or wiring, and can also be aesthetic elements in a building's design. For instance, some walls can be made from glass, giving the building a modern aesthetically pleasing look while also allowing natural light to enter the building, which can be essential in reducing energy costs. In addition to their physical aspects, these elements have more profound social, economic, and environmental implications. Buildings cater to the need for spaces where society can live, interact, and conduct activities that contribute to the economy. Also, the design, construction, and function of buildings have substantial impacts on the environment pertaining to the use of resources, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the concepts of building, function, and wall are not just physical constructs but are also interpreted in the broader context of societal, economic, and environmental dimensions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. \\"not guilty\\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \\"not proven\\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England.  - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There...  - An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small guerrilla band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - Charles Swan ( died 1690 ) was a reluctant buccaneer . Captain Swan was forced into piracy by his crew in the 1680s , and proceeded to write letters to the owners of his ship Cygnet in London , begging them to intercede with James II of England for his pardon - even as he looted his way up and down the coast of South America . He was present at the attack on Payta in 1684 , where he petulantly burned the town after no booty was found . On 25 August 1685 , he separated from his confederates Peter Harris and Edward Davis , and sailed up the coast of Mexico , but met with little success . He seized the town of Santa Pecaque but lost fifty men to a Spanish counter-attack , including Basil Ringrose . On 31 March 1686 he set out across the Pacific to ambush the Manila treasure galleon , but failed to over-take the ship . Due to the failure of the assault on Santa Pecaque provisions were short , and by the time they reached the East Indies the crew were plotting to eat their officers of the Cygnet as it crossed the Pacific ( starting with the Captain ) . ( Swan is reported to have remarked that the lean William Dampier would have made them a poor meal ; the captain himself was a remarkably fat man . ) Fortunately they arrived at Guam without resorting to cannibalism , and made their way on to the Sultanate of Mindanao . The arrogance of Swan and unruliness of his men soon spoiled their good relations with the local ruler , Raja Laut ; and when the captain decided to abandon the attempt on the galleon , his men mutinied . He managed to save five thousand pounds ( legally the property of the Cygnet 's owners ) from the mutineers , and remained in Mindanao , becoming an officer in Laut 's army ; but in 1690 he attempted to escape back to England on a Dutch ship with the money , and was chased by Laut 's warriors , who capsized his boat and speared him in the water .  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Buccaneers were pirates of the Caribbean Sea who challenged Spanish hegemony on the region by attacking ships and sacking coastal settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Before long, they became a threat to non-Spanish settlements as well, and the target of anti-piracy crusades. Today the idea of a buccaneer plays a role similar to \\"pirate\\". Original buccaneer crews, however, were larger, localized to the Caribbean region, and more apt to attack well-defended ports than pirates who sailed to the Indian Ocean on the Pirate Round of the late 17th century.  - James II and VII (14 October 1633  16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland.  - A pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if never convicted.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - The Sea Peoples were a purported seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt prior to the Late Bronze Age collapse. Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max Müller: \\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\".  - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689.  - Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship- or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Pirate Round was a sailing route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates, mainly during the late 17th century. The course led from the western Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, stopping at Madagascar, then on to targets such as the coast of Yemen and India. The Pirate Round was briefly used again during the early 1720s. Pirates who followed the route are sometimes referred to as Roundsmen. The Pirate Round was largely co-extensive with the routes of the East India Company ships, of Britain and other nations.  - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities.  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors.  - Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. It is also known, in French, as guerre de course (literally, \\"war of the chase\\") and, in German, Handelskrieg (\\"trade war\\"), from the nations most heavily committed to it historically as a strategy.  - Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word \\"rob\\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. \\"deraubare\\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \\"raub\\" -- \\"theft\\".  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.    What is the relationship between 'charles swan ' and 'privateer'? Answer:","output":"Charles Swan was a reluctant buccaneer and a captain during the late 17th century. He was forced into piracy by his crew, which involved attacking and looting ships and coastal settlements along the coast of South America. In the context of privateering, Swan's situation was unique, as he did not willingly engage in piracy and even sought a pardon from the English authorities. Privateers, on the other hand, were private individuals or ships that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war, also known as a letter of marque. This authorized them to attack enemy vessels during wartime and capture them as prizes. Although privateers engaged in similar activities as pirates, they were legally sanctioned by their governments, making their actions legitimate forms of war. In summary, Charles Swan was a buccaneer captain who was forced into piracy by his crew, while privateers were state-sanctioned individuals or ships that engaged in maritime warfare. Although their actions were similar, privateers had legal authorization for their activities, unlike Swan, who sought a pardon for his piracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, many years ago I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car, and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a mouse.That's how the story of Stuart Little got started. As for Charlotte's Web, I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be, at all hours.One day when I was on my way to feed the pig, I began feeling sorry for the pig because, like most pigs, he was doomed to die.This made me sa So I started thinking of ways to save a pig's life.I had been watching a big grey spider at her work and was impressed by how clever she was at weaving.Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know, a story of friendship and salvation  on a farm.Three years after I started writing it, it was publishe (I am not a fast worker, as you can see.) Sometimes I'm asked how old I was when I started to write, and what made me want to write.I started early - as soon as I could spell.In fact, I can't remember any time in my life when I wasn't busy writing.I don't know what caused me to do it, or why I enjoyed it, but I think children often find pleasure and satisfaction is trying to set their thoughts down on paper, either in words or in pictures.I was no good at drawing, so I used words instea As I grew older, I found that writing can be a way of earning a living. Some of my readers want me to visit their school.Some want me to send a picture, or an autograph, or a book.And some ask questions about my family and my animals and my pets.Much as I'd like to, I can't go visiting.I can't send books, either - you can find them in a bookstore or a library.Many children assume that a writer owns (or even makes) his own books.This is not true - books are made by the...

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?, using the article: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife is Barbirolli.

Question: Given the below context:  Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.  Guess a valid title for it!

Choices:  - unsaturated  - hdl  - insulin  - ldl  A: A:","output":"The type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \\"bad\\" is LDL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. To understand why LDL is considered bad, it is essential to know what cholesterol is and how it functions within the body. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is present in all cells of the body. It plays an essential role in various bodily functions, such as the production of hormones, cell membrane formation, and nutrient digestion. However, when cholesterol levels become unbalanced, it can lead to health issues, specifically cardiovascular diseases. There are two primary types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Each type has a unique role and function in the body. 1. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Often referred to as \\"good\\" cholesterol, HDL is responsible for carrying cholesterol from other parts of the body back to the liver. The liver then processes and removes it from the body. Higher HDL levels are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease because it helps clear excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. 2. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): LDL is considered \\"bad\\" cholesterol because it transports cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body. When there is too much LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, it can lead to the formation of plaque in the arteries. Plaque is a buildup of cholesterol, fats, and other substances that can narrow and harden the arteries, obstructing blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Although LDL cholesterol is necessary for the proper functioning of the body, elevated levels of it can be harmful. Factors contributing to high LDL cholesterol levels include an unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats), lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, and genetic predisposition. In some cases, high LDL cholesterol levels may also be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or kidney disease. Maintaining a proper balance between HDL and LDL cholesterol is vital for overall health and well-being. Lifestyle modifications, such as adopting a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, can help manage cholesterol levels. In some cases, medication and medical interventions may also be necessary for individuals with persistently high LDL cholesterol levels. In summary, LDL cholesterol is the type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \\"bad\\" because high levels of it can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by contributing to plaque buildup in the arteries. Maintaining a healthy balance between LDL and HDL cholesterol is essential for a healthy cardiovascular system and overall bodily function."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast.

No fringe benefits for emos as haircuts that flop over one eye could result in generation of young people with lazy eyes      UNDER all those long lopsided fringes, a hidden danger is lurking.      A leading optometrist has warned children and teenagers are risking their eyesight for the sake of fashion.      Favoured by celebrities including Reece Mastin and Justin Bieber, the current zeal for haircuts with fringes that flop over one eye could result in a generation of young people with lazy eyes.      Photos: Reece Mastin      Photos: Justin Bieber      Optometrists Association national executive member Andrew Hogan warned amblyopia - the medical term for lazy eye - could result from obstructed vision caused by hair.      \\"If a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time, that eye won't see a lot of detail,\\" Mr Hogan said.      \\"And if it happens from a young age, that eye can become amblyotic.\\"      Mr Hogan said the most vulnerable age for visual development was birth to seven years, but research had shown vision could still be affected at later stages.      As well as the potential damage to eyesight, there are also concerns that long \\"emo\\" sweep fringes could cause postural problems.      Veteran hairdresser Roseanne Anderson fears the hairstyle forced many to tilt their heads to one side in order to see out of their small window of vision.      \\"I have to wonder how they don't get a stiff neck,\\" the Hobart-based hairdresser said.      \\"I have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when I think about it, this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing that could be a health hazard.\\"      Mr Hogan said a curtain of hair over one eye could actually act like an eyepatch, limiting the eye's access to both sunlight and sensory stimulation.      He said recent research had shown a lack of direct sunlight resulted in short sightedness.      And hair constantly hanging over one eye could result in sensory deprivation that could weaken one eye and lead to amblyopia.      \\"If you walk around with an eye patch on all day, then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye,\\" he added.      Amblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop because the abnormal eye sends a blurred image to the brain. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over.

With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not a correct answer to your question.  The bombing of Pearl Harbor, a surprise military attack, took place on December 7, 1941. It was carried out by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This event led to the United States' entry into World War II. The attack began at approximately 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time and was executed in two waves. The first wave targeted airfields and battleships, while the second wave focused on other ships and shipyard facilities. In total, the attack lasted about two hours, resulting in significant devastation and loss of life. The United States suffered the loss of 2,403 personnel, while 1,178 others were wounded. Additionally, eight battleships, three cruisers, four destroyers, and several aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Regarding the captured Japanese sailor you mentioned, his name was Kazuo Sakamaki. Sakamaki was one of the ten Japanese sailors who tried to execute suicide attacks against US ships by using midget submarines during the Pearl Harbor attack. However, Sakamaki's mission did not go as planned. His submarine faced various issues, including being spotted by a destroyer and issues with firing torpedoes.  Sakamaki was finally forced to abandon his sinking submarine, and he attempted to swim to shore with his unconscious crewmate. Unfortunately, his crewmate did not survive, and Sakamaki was discovered by an American soldier unconscious and injured on the shore of Oahu on December 8, 1941. He was the only Japanese sailor captured during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Write some highlights for the following article: Springwood teenagers Dean, Kris, Jesse, Nancy and Quentin are having trouble not sleeping: They're knocking back coffee, popping pills, anything to delay another date with their dream stalker (which may explain why these high school students look like college grads). When one of them does drop off, the bedsheets turn red. Wes Craven's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low-budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio, New Line -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade. With his battered fedora, a striped sweater, a razor-glove and a face like Sal's Famous, Freddy Krueger was the most personable boogie man Hollywood had come up with in a long time, so what if he was also a child abuser? A recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept, Freddy preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics: If Salvador Dali had created a slasher movie villain, he might have come up with someone like Freddy. After eight movies, a TV series and a comic book, you might think Mr. Krueger had been done to death. It's been seven years since Freddy put Jason Vorhees in his place (in \\"Freddy vs Jason\\"). But you can't keep a good bad guy down, and at the rate Hollywood is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue, we'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now. Directed by pop video director Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, the new \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is actually a lot like the old one. So much so, for a while you wonder why they didn't just re-release it. (You'll wish they had.) Surprisingly, Bayer doesn't go the Michael Bay route and give it a high-gloss, ADD tempo, but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original (the glove in the bath, for instance, and the face coming through the wallpaper), he fails to put his own stamp on it. As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley, who was Oscar nominated for playing a sex offender in \\"Little Children\\" (and who went on to play Rorschach in \\"Watchmen\\" and the battered psychopath Noyce in \\"Shutter Island\\") finds Robert Englund a tough act to follow. Haley drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this Freddy mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he's significantly shorter than Englund, and the make-up suggests nothing so much as Ray Bolger in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": the scarecrow who didn't even scare the crows. iReporter gives new \\"Nightmare\\" an \\"A\\" Branching out tentatively toward something new, the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe Freddy was innocent; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him. I'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion, but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go? The new \\"Nightmare\\" also proudly introduces a clinical-sounding term called \\"micro-naps,\\" a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two (gratifyingly, they're the least synthetic of the young cast members). But is it scary? Barely. In the wake of \\"Paranormal Activity,\\" Freddy's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat. There is nothing about this redundant remake to give anyone sleepless nights, unless it's threat of yet more of the same old same old. Enough with the \\"re-imagining,\\" Hollywood; just imagine! Highlights:","output":"1. \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" remake directed by Samuel Bayer pays homage to Wes Craven's iconic 1984 slumber party massacre. 2. Despite using similar memorable scenes as the original movie, the remake fails to provide a fresh perspective. 3.

BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy.        Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines.        In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books.        Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources.        Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market.        The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant  regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors.       Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has  _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world. There are ten times as many newspapers and magazines because   _  . A) the publishing houses want to make more money. B) there are more readers along with the bigger population. C) economic and education have developed under the policy. D) the legal system overseeing the publishing industries has changed.","output":"The number of Chinese newspapers and magazines have increased ten times compared to 30 years ago because of several factors: 1. The reform and opening-up policy in China has led to rapid economic development and universal education. This has created a higher demand for information sources to cater to the growing and more educated population.  2. With the transition to a market economy, numerous publishing houses and newspapers have restructured their management systems, resulting in the establishment of corporations that are listed on the stock market. This change has led to increased investment and expansion in the publishing industry. 3. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also evolved over the last three decades. Since 1990, a law and five relevant regulations were adopted to govern these sectors, giving the industry more structure, guidance, and possibly more opportunities to grow. So, the correct answer is C) economic and education have developed under the policy, which has fueled the need for more information sources, contributing to the dramatic increase in the number of newspapers and magazines in China over the last 30 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ina Garten On How To Run A Business And Do What You Love Ina Garten, beloved host of Emmy Award-winning show Barefoot Contessa and author of bestselling cookbooks such as How Easy Is That?, knows a thing or two about cooking up a storm with a smile. “You want to do something you love doing, whether you are getting paid for it or not, if you can,” said Garten, speaking at Forbes’ third annual Women’s Summit, a gathering of hundreds of women entrepreneurs and leaders in New York with the aim of changing the power imbalance in the business world. As Forbes Woman publisher Moira Forbes told a packed house at Manhattan’s Chelsea Piers, Garten transitioned from working in the White House on the budget for enriched uranium programs to running her own small business, a specialty food store in her adopted home in the Hamptons. Garten described her fatigue with Washington, and her motivation for switching careers: “I was thinking, life has to be more fun than this.” Encouraged by her husband Jeffrey, who is often the quiet star of Garten’s home cooking show, Garten decided to pick something she enjoyed. “If it’s fun, you’ll be really good at it,” Garten assured. Garten bought a small store after making an offer she didn’t think the proprietor would accept: “She called me and said ‘Thank you very much, I accept your offer’ and I went, ’Oh, shit.’” The audience erupted in laughter hearing the composed Garten swear, but took note as she shared small business advice. “Starting small and buying a business already in progress made it possible for me,” Garten said, recalling that she would find herself working many long hours perfecting new recipes. It wasn’t all a piece of cake – Garten was selling food in store and catering, but eventually stopped the latter because it was too draining. After two decades running the Hampton staple, Garten decided to change everything – for the second time. “I was 50 years old and I thought the best years of my career were over,” Garten, 67, said. “It wasn’t stimulating to me and I tried to figure out what to do next.” So the Barefoot Contessa sold her store to two employees, bought an office above it, and did nothing for the first time ever. “Type A people think they can figure out what to do next while they’re doing something, and they can’t,” Garten advised, beaming at the crowd. “An important part of changing and figuring out what to do next is you have to just stop. I had to get good and bored before I could decide what was next – I thought maybe I’ll write a cookbook while I figure it out.” Garten invested heavily in her first publication, 1999′s “The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,” by hiring her own photographer and publicist to retain control of the project. “Marth Stewart said, ‘Go to book stores and ask to sign books,’ so I went to the head of this book store in Newport, California, and said, ‘I’ve written a book, would you like me to sign it?’” The manager agreed, but realized the store had already sold out for the day. “That was the moment I though, ‘Oh, this might work.’” From the cookbook, cooking show requests followed. But it was not until 2002 that Garten transitioned from print to small screen. “I just didn’t think I would be good at it. I’d seen Martha [Stewart] and Nigella Lawson and I just never saw myself as a teacher,” recalled Garten, in an important reminder not to underestimate oneself. Garten, who has published nine recipe books to date, remains modest about her television success: “I do the TV because it’s an important part of the business, but it’s the cookbooks I love writing.” She reminded the accomplished audience that ‘no’ is a complete sentence and making time for oneself is equally important. “I think when we’re young we say yes to everything, but when you realize your brand is working, you start making choices,” said Garten, who says she turned down frozen dinner and dog food deals among others because they did not fit with her fun cooking style. “Oscar Wilde used to say, ‘work is easy, fun is hard’” Garten pointed out. “You know what you need to do for work but it’s the personal life that gets what’s left over, rather than vice versa.” To avoid burnout, Garten suggests planning downtime a year in advance, and credits these breaks with giving her some of her best ideas. “Jeffrey and I go away two weeks at a time two to three times a year.” As the conversation came to a close, Garten gave poignant advice to her twenty-something self: “Do what you love. If it’s fun, you’ll be really good at it. And don’t worry so much.” Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway. Does it follow that \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\"?","output":"In order to determine if the statement \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\" follows this statement: \\"If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway,\\" let's break down the original statement and analyze its components. 1. Analyze the original statement: \\"If I don't agree, likely you'll trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me anyway.\\" The original statement conveys that, regardless of whether the speaker agrees or not, there is a high probability that the listener will take action and make corrections anyway (using the metaphor of re-shoeing the foreleg of a horse). Here, \\"trip up m' foreleg an' reshoe me\\" implies that the listener may try to fix something or take a certain action irrespective of the speaker's agreement. 2. Compare the original statement to the new statement: \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions.\\" The new statement implies that the listener will achieve success or complete a task, regardless of what the speaker thinks or feels. While there is a thematic similarity between the two statements, as both express a sense of determination on the part of the listener, there are some differences as well. 3. Determine if the new statement follows the original statement: The original statement implies that the listener will likely take action to correct an issue, regardless of the speaker's agreement. The new statement suggests that the listener will succeed in their endeavor, irrespective of the speaker's opinions. While there are similarities, the new statement focuses more on the certainty of success against the speaker's opinions, whereas the original statement revolves around the listener's action in the face of disagreement. Conclusion: The new statement, \\"You will succeed in spite of my opinions,\\" doesn't exactly follow the original statement, but it does share a related theme. Both statements convey the listener's determination and willingness to act, even if the speaker doesn't agree or holds a different opinion. However, the new statement emphasizes the listener's success, while the original statement highlights the action of fixing or correcting something."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What is affirmative action trying to fix?\\"  Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"  Answer:","output":"Affirmative action aims to address and remedy past discrimination and promote diversity by providing opportunities for underrepresented groups in various areas such as education, employment, and government contracts. However, critics argue that it may benefit mostly middle-class minorities and can lead to negative consequences such as self-doubt, entitlement, exploitation of group preferences, and animosity towards preferred groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which country had  higher gold reserves, Russia or Japan?","output":"Title: Gold Reserves in Russia and Japan: A Comparison Introduction Gold reserves reflect the economic stability and financial strength of a country. These reserves are compelling indicators of a nation's capability to handle market fluctuations and strengthen its currency, particularly in times of crisis. Russia and Japan have been economic powerhouses in their respective regions and the world. As such, it is vital to understand their gold reserve positioning to gain insight into their overall financial status. This article seeks to answer the question: Which country had higher gold reserves, Russia or Japan? Russia's Gold Reserves Russia has persistently been among the top gold reserve holders globally. According to the World Gold Council, as of October 2021, Russia held about 2,296.5 metric tons of gold in its reserves, making it the fifth largest holder in the world. The country has made a strategic move in recent years to increase its gold reserves as part of its effort to reduce its reliance on the US dollar while coping with the economic sanctions imposed on it. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has been active in purchasing gold to stabilize its financial system and diversify its reserves away from foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar. This move has allowed Russia to strengthen its economy and mitigate potential risks caused by geopolitical tensions and market volatilities. Russia is also endowed with abundant gold resources, ranking third in global gold production in 2020. This has facilitated direct procurement of gold by the CBR from domestic mines, significantly contributing to its gold reserves. Japan's Gold Reserves Japan has a substantial amount of gold reserves as well. As of October 2021, Japan possessed approximately 846.9 metric tons of gold, ranking as the ninth largest holder in the world, according to the World Gold Council. However, Japan's approach to gold reserves reflects its conservative monetary policy and emphasis on foreign currency reserves. While gold plays a vital role in Japan's reserves, the nation prioritizes maintaining large amounts of foreign currency reserves, predominantly held in US Treasury bonds. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has consistently maintained its gold reserves at a more or less static level for the past few decades, showcasing its preference for stability and minimal fluctuations. Japan's massive holdings of foreign currencies have contributed to the strength and stability of the yen, demonstrating the efficiency of its monetary policy. Comparison and Conclusion In response to the question, it is clear that Russia currently has higher gold reserves when compared to Japan. With over 2,296.5 metric tons of gold, Russia has managed to secure the fifth-highest position in gold reserves globally. In comparison, Japan's 846.9 metric tons make it the ninth largest holder in the world. The differences in gold reserves between the two countries can be attributed to their divergent approaches toward reserve management and monetary policies. Russia's focus on increasing gold reserves can be seen as a strategic move to boost its economic resilience and diversify its assets, especially in the face of geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions. On the other hand, Japan's preference for stability and a sizable foreign currency reserve illustrates its conservative approach and emphasis on maintaining the strength of the yen. Overall, Russia has managed to accumulate higher gold reserves compared to Japan. However, it is essential to consider that these gold reserves are just one aspect of both countries' complex financial systems and should be analyzed in conjunction with other economic indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their respective financial statuses."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What did you do for your spouse’s birthday? What forms of birth control do you use? You can’t immediately apply for naturalization after receiving your green card. Instead, you must meet the following residency requirements:  You must have been a green card holder for the three years immediately before you apply for naturalization. You must have been a continuous resident for the three years before you apply and have been physically present in the U.S. for at least eighteen months. You must have lived in a marriage with your U.S. citizen spouse during the three years. Your spouse must have been a citizen during the entire time. You must have lived within the state or USCIS district for at least three months before you file your application. In addition to residency, you need to show that you have other personal characteristics to be eligible. Check that you satisfy the following:  You must be at least eighteen years of age. You must be able to write, read, and speak English. You need to be a person of good moral character. Generally, this means you haven’t broken a serious law and that you meet your legal obligations, such as paying taxes and child support.  You must have entered the country legally. For example, you can’t be in the United States illegally and get citizenship simply because you married a citizen. Once you have satisfied the residency requirement, you can submit Form 400, Application for Naturalization. Download and read the instructions before completing the application, available here: https://www.uscis.gov/n-400. When you are ready to file, call 1-800-375-5283 to find out the address.  Read the instructions to find out what documents you must submit along with your application. Make payment to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” As of June 2017, the filing fee is 640 and the biometric fee is 85. You can pay using money order or check. USCIS will send you a notice telling you where to give your fingerprints and when. USCIS needs your fingerprints so that the FBI can run a background check. You’ll need to meet with immigration officials to go over your application. USCIS is looking to confirm that your application is legitimate and that nothing has changed since you submitted it. You’ll receive a checklist of documents to take with you to the interview, so gather everything ahead of time. You must pass exams in civics and English. You will take them at your interview, and you should prepare as much as possible. For example, look to see if a preparation class is offered near you for either test. You can find the nearest classes at this website: https://my.uscis.gov/findaclass. Enter your zip code. Several practice civics tests are available here: https://my.uscis.gov/prep/test/civics. The final step is to swear the Oath of Allegiance at your naturalization ceremony. Form 455 will tell you when and where the ceremony will take place. At the end of the ceremony, you’ll receive your certificate of naturalization.","output":"To become a U.S. citizen through marriage, first, your spouse needs to submit Form I-130 along with proof of marriage. If you are living in the U.S., you can also file Form I-485 to adjust your status. If living outside the U.S., you need to wait for visa approval and attend an interview at the nearest embassy or consulate. You must meet residency requirements before applying for naturalization, including holding a green card for three years, being a continuous resident, and living in a marriage with a U.S. citizen spouse. You also need to meet eligibility criteria, such as being at least 18 years old, possessing English language skills, and having good moral character.  Once you meet the requirements, submit Form 400 and complete associated tasks like fingerprinting and background checks. Attend an interview with immigration officials and pass exams in civics and English.

Q:Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

A 22-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly fatally stabbing a mother of two who tripped her boyfriend over in a Las Vegas bar on Tuesday night. Sarah Ann Chavez is accused of killing 30-year-old Misty Elaine Madera following a brawl at Champagne's Cafe on South Maryland Parkway about 11pm. Officers found Madera lying in the back parking lot with stab wounds to her neck as Chavez, covered in blood, was being held back by a bar patron. Madera was rushed to Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center but was pronounced dead shortly after arriving. Witnesses told police the dispute was triggered when Madera tripped Chavez’s. boyfriend inside the bar as he walked to the restroom, Las Vegas Sun reported. Chavez allegedly confronted Madera, from Las Vegas, and they argued briefly. Chavez and her boyfriend were about to leave the bar, before Chavez decided the issue wasn't settled. She again confronted Madera, but this time Madera's sister got involved. The. fight spilled out a back door and into the lot. A bar patron allegedly separated the women, but Chavez punched Madera. Madera reportedly yelled, 'She has a knife', before she was attacked. A bartender called 911 after seeing blood. Misty Madera (pictured) was allegedly sitting near the back of the bar with her sister when she tripped over Chavez's boyfriend, triggering the fight. Distressing: Misty Madera, left pictured with her husband Willie Henning and one of their children, died in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in the neck on Tuesday night. Las Vegas Sun reported the bar patron who had separated the. women detained Chavez while waiting for police. He also warned Chavez’s. boyfriend to stay away from them. The boyfriend allegedly left before police. arrived. Chavez later told police she started the physical altercation in the bar because she felt 'threatened' when Madera stood up. Chavez said she punched Madera. in the chest and the fight was on. The young woman also admitted she armed herself on. the way back into the bar because she was afraid of the two women. Police discovered a Smith and Wesson folding knife south of the scene. Chavez has been jailed without bond in the Clark County Detention Center on one count of murder with a deadly weapon. The fatal stabbing occurred at Champagne's Cafe on South Maryland Parkway in Las Vegas (pictured) Madera is survived by her husband, Willie Henning, and their two young sons.

Painters, poets, actors, and dancers all thrive here, but our protagonist, Joseph Buquet, is certainly not one of them - at least not yet. A poor migrant worker from the rural provinces, Joseph finds employment as a stagehand at the resplendent Opéra Garnier, enchanted by the prospect of a life embedded in grandeur and art. One evening after a show, while clearing the props, Joseph hears a strange, haunting melody wafting from high in the rafters. Driven by curiosity and fearless naivety, he climbs up into the seemingly endless catacombs that encase the Opéra. He stumbles into an opulent sitting room, where he finds a masked figure playing an organ - the elusive \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". As Joseph confronts him, the Phantom quickly incapacitates him, restrained less by malice than a deep fear of being discovered. In enthralling monologues interspersed with terrified silences from Joseph, the Phantom unveils his backstory - he is Erik, horribly disfigured from birth and rejected by society, who had found refuge and purpose within the opera house. Joseph, a stranger in the grand city himself, feels a surprising connection. Over days of being Erik's captive, he offers to keep Erik's secret if allowed to return to work. Striking an uncertain truce, Erik agrees, releasing Joseph but warning him of severe consequences if he ever breaches their accord. Back amid the stagehands, Joseph's experiences change him, inspiring him to pen a theatrical piece about the Phantom - harboring intentions to assist the misunderstood Erik and transform societal prejudice. His charming script combined with insider secrets from Erik about the opera's design results in a performance that leaves audiences spellbound. However, Madam Carlotta, the opera's lead singer, suspicious of the sudden rise and changing demeanor of a stagehand, starts investigating. Discovering the acquaintance between Joseph and the Phantom, she threatens to unmask Erik's secret, driven by jealousy and a hatred for the unknown. Joseph and Erik now find themselves in a rapidly tightening-corner, wrestling against time to protect both their lives and Erik's secret. The movie culminates in a thrilling climax depicting their desperate efforts to prevent the fall of Erik’s hidden kingdom, ultimately leading to unexpected twists, surrenders, and revelations. \\"The Phantom's Labyrinth\\" explores themes of acceptance, social stigma, dreams, vulnerability, and friendship, providing a poignant narrative that offers more than just a glimpse into the hidden life of a famous phantom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS, though instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion. Plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou. This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE, though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all.

The review starts with a somewhat negative statement, acknowledging that the film isn't great but admires the writers and director for trying something different. 2. The reviewer mentions the film's main theme and compares it to another film, SLIDING DOORS, implying some positive similarities. 3. The reviewer talks about an odd bald guy, showing some curiosity about the character but not strong emotion. 4. The reviewer points out that the DVD jacket capitalizes on Audrey Tautou's success, indicating that it might be misleading as many actors are involved in the film. 5. Positive points are mentioned, such as the brisk pace, fine acting, and a satisfying conclusion. 6. The reviewer ends with some minor criticisms, such as uninteresting characters and a potentially excessive number of subplots. From the analysis, we can infer that the sentiment of this review is mixed leaning towards positive. The reviewer appreciates certain aspects of the film, such as its unique approach and overall execution, but also acknowledges its shortcomings, such as uninteresting characters and unnecessary subplots."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: This article: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium in the Elephant Island party is Frank.

Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Blaisdon is a village and civil parish in the Forest of Dean of Gloucestershire, England, about ten miles west of Gloucester. Its population in 2005 was estimated by Gloucestershire County Council to be 249. A estimate in 2012 placed the population at 420.

Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

The statement \\"Three men are standing outside on the sidewalk conversing.\\" implies that there are three men outside a building, engaging in conversation on a sidewalk. This description provides a clear visual representation of the scenario. Since they are \\"outside\\" on the sidewalk, it is understood that they are not within a building or any indoor setting. On the other hand, the statement \\"The three men are indoors.\\" contradicts the first statement. It suggests that the three men are inside a building or an enclosed space, not outside like the first statement asserts. They cannot be both outside on the sidewalk and indoors simultaneously because these two scenarios are mutually exclusive. Being indoors and being outdoors are two separate and opposing conditions. Given the information presented in both statements, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Three men are standing outside on the sidewalk conversing\\" if \\"The three men are indoors.\\" This is a logical contradiction, and both situations cannot be true at the same time. The two statements are in conflict with each other, and as a result, it would be incorrect to reach the conclusion that the men are outside while also knowing that they are indoors.

German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. Context: The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI.  The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\"  On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal.  The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Question: Was Dear God considered as  heavy as their previous songs ? Answer:","output":"No, \\"Dear God\\" is not as heavy as their previous songs. It has a country style, which is different from Avenged Sevenfold's usual heavy metal sound. The band likes to experiment with different music genres, and \\"Dear God\\" is an example of that."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This may seem irrelevant, but if you're running in shoes that are too old, too snug, too loose, or which just don't give you the correct support, then you may not be maximizing your potential. Don't be shy. Go to a running store, where a professional can help you find the best fit, and sometimes even watch you run to see what type of shoe would suit you the best. Here are some things to keep in mind when you consider buying new running shoes:  How long you've had the old pair. You should replace any pair of running shoes after running between 300–400 miles (480–640 km), which can translate into less than a year of running about 10 miles (16 km) a week, or a lot sooner if you used to them for marathon or half-marathon training. Running in shoes that are no longer in good shape will not only make it harder for you to run fast, but they can lead to injuries.     {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5c/590103-13b1.jpg/v4-460px-590103-13b1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/5/5c/590103-13b1.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-13b1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  Wiggle room. You should have at least a thumb's width of room between the end of your longest toe and the front of your shoe. Most people buy running shoes that are actually too small for them, so it's okay if it feels like you're wearing clown shoes, at first.     {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/590103-13b2.jpg/v4-460px-590103-13b2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/b/b0/590103-13b2.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-13b2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  A secure fit throughout the mid-foot. Your feet should feel pretty snug on either side. A secure fit throughout the heel. Slipping in this area can lead to injuries. You should be eating well enough to give yourself plenty of energy for running, but not so much that you feel sluggish or tired. Don't eat less than an hour before your mile training, or you will feel sluggish and tied down. If you know you'll be doing some intense training on the track or sprinting, eat until you're about 2/3 full. You should eat foods that contain carbohydrates and that are easily digestible, and which will give you energy without weighing you down. Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to eat right to help yourself get faster:  It's all about balance. Though the right carbohydrates will give you energy, don't forget that protein or those fruits and veggies. If you're just training to improve your mile time, you do not need to load up on carbohydrates. Don't eat a heavy bowl of pasta before your run, thinking it will give you the energy you need. If you're looking to eat a snack that will help you train, try a banana, a peach, half of a Cliff bar, a piece of wheat toast, or an English muffin with jelly.     {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/69/590103-14b3.jpg/v4-460px-590103-14b3.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/69/590103-14b3.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-14b3.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Drink at least a 16 oz. glass of water an hour before your run, and make sure you consume at least 8-10 of these glasses throughout the day. In addition to drinking water, drinking a cup of coffee about 30 minutes to an hour before you run can make you go faster. However, don't try this for the first time on race day, or it can make you feel a little bit too jittery and can lead to some digestive issues.     {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d1/590103-15b1.jpg/v4-460px-590103-15b1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/d1/590103-15b1.jpg/aid590103-v4-728px-590103-15b1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you're at a healthy weight for your height and frame, then you don't need to try to lose weight at all. However, if you are carrying a little extra weight, it will slow you down because it will weigh your body down as you try to run your mile. Therefore, work on finding a healthy routine for weight loss while continuing to run regularly and eating foods that keep you strong. Running with people who are at your speed, or preferably faster than you, can help you stay motivated and not slack off if you're getting tired. Whether you're on a track team, in a runner's club, or running 5Ks in your town as often as you can, just having the company of others can help you stay strong, think fit, and try to break your own records. And most of all, running with other people can remind you that while fitness is an important goal, so is having fun! Whether you're doing them with your track team or on your own, if you want to improve your speed, you should periodically time yourself when you run the mile, simulating the pressure you'd feel if you were running a real race. You don't have to time yourself every time you do the mile or you will put too much pressure on yourself, but you should do it at least once a week so you put the pressure on, put your body in adrenaline mode, and get ready to succeed. If you beat your PR (personal record), celebrate and think of all the things you do right, so you can continue to kick up your speed in the future. If you're trying to be the start of your high school track team, then yeah, you can aim for running a 6-6:30 mile, or even a 5-5:30 mile. But if you're just trying to run a mile faster because you want to have fun and stay fit, then aiming for that 12 or 10 minute mile is a very impressive goal as well. You don't have to be Usain Bolt to feel good about how quickly you run, and you don't have to keep the pace with all the other runners around you if your body is screaming for you to slow down. It's great to improve your speed, but it's even more important to stay healthy and be proud of yourself for staying fit.","output":"Improving a mile run time involves proper selection of footwear and adequate nutrition and hydration. Regular footwear checks are encouraged; shoes are to be replaced after running 300–400 miles, taking into consideration factors like proper fit and comfort. Before a mile training, it's advised not to eat less than an hour prior and consume an easily digestible and energizing diet with balanced nutrients. Drinking at least 16 oz. glass of water an hour ahead and maintaining 8-10 glasses throughout the day is also suggested. One may consider coffee too, as it could enhance speed, but should be avoided if it's not part of a regular diet. For improved speed, occasional trials under race-like pressure can be helpful. Also, staying fit and active by running frequently and participating in running groups offer both motivation and fun. Regardless of speed, maintaining a healthy weight and fitness should be prioritized."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Judge Grants Illegal Immigrant Work Privileges In Jail Sentence For Drunken-Driving Incident A Wisconsin sheriff is protesting a recent “slap-on-the wrist” court ruling that allows a man in the country illegally to seek employment as he completes an 11-month jail term from driving drunk in the wrong direction on an interstate. \\"Why would we let an illegal immigrant out on work release to look for a job he's not supposed to have? He's in the country illegally,\\" Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. said, according to a report by The Journal Sentinel. Clarke told his office staff Thursday to inform the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and ask that the man be deported, the paper reported. On July 21, Armando Rodriguez-Benitez, 35, was pulled over by authorities for driving with a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit while headed in the wrong direction on the I-43, the paper reported. An oncoming car was forced to intentionally crash into the median wall to avoid a head-on collision with the intoxicated man's car, according to the report. The paper, citing online court records, reported that a county judge sentenced him to 11 months at a county jail with so-called Huber work release privileges, under a statute that allows some inmates to leave jail to maintain their employment while serving out their sentence. Rick D. Steinberg, Benitez’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com that his client has a \\"high degree\\" of character and education that makes the work release appropriate. \\"This is not your normal criminal,\\" Steinberg said, adding that he has a supportive family and deep roots in the community. \\"Bottom line is that he made a mistake, and he apologized to the court in a better way than I could have.\\" Steinberg didn't dispute that Benitez is in the country illegally, though he declined to discuss Benitez's employment status. Christine Neuman-Ortiz, from Voces de la Frontera, an immigration rights group, told a local radio station that the sheriff is stereotyping immigrants. \\"I think the sheriff should know he's not an immigration judge,\\" she said reported WTMJ. \\"The decision was in regards to driving violations and not related to immigration issues.\\" Benitez pleaded guilty to recklessly endangering safety, a felony, according to court documents. He was fined for drunken driving as a first offense, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. The sheriff, meanwhile, criticized the sentence, considering Benitez had faced up to 10 years in prison and, in Clarke's view, should have been deported immediately. A phone call to the judge's office was not immediately returned. \\"If the judge didn't find this incident serious enough to send him to prison for an extended period of time, then an 11-month bed-and-breakfast stay at the county jail is a waste of taxpayer resources,\\" Clarke said. \\"The deportation process should start today, not 11 months from now.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A Wisconsin sheriff is protesting a court ruling that allows an illegal immigrant to seek employment while serving an 11-month jail term for a drunken-driving incident.

Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood, Ontario in 1997. Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making Three Days Grace a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also bassist Brad Walst's brother. From March to August 2008, and from January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families in which they stated, \\"We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It's a new beginning. It's life starting over.\\"  According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centres around \\"a new sense of freshness\\" and the idea that \\"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change\\".  Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \\"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now \\"...continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a 'hint of sunlight'.\\" He complimented the album, saying it \\"...treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers\\".  The first single release from the album, \\"Break\\", was released on September 1, 2009. In support of the album, Three Days Grace embarked on a 20 date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009. They co-headlined a January-February 2010 tour of the U.S. with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.  Life Starts Now was nominated for \\"Best Rock Album\\" at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Billy Talent III.

Passage: The crew of a malfunctioning alien cargo ship make an emergency landing on Earth. This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being. While conducting a physical examination on Willy, Cosia discovers that his biology is more advanced than anything known to their species; encouraging Cosia with exaggerated claims about his sexual prowess, Willy loses his virginity to her.

By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. This angered the government, and led to his transfer from the capital (1820). He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea, then to Kamenka and Chisinau, where he became a Freemason.

I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word. Some have described us not meeting the goal as a “failure”. I don’t see it that way. Let’s be honest: 32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn’t come cheap (and remember that the 32million didn’t include any costs for software engineering and project management…Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though. I am not surprised that we didn’t hit this ambitious 32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more. Every single person who put their support into the Ubuntu Edge campaign should be proud of their achievements and we are all thankful for your tremendous and inspiring support.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What do people usually tie a ribbon around as a present? Possible A: floral arrangement, girl's hair, box, car, typewriter  Why is \\"floral arrangement\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The \\"floral arrangement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, floral arrangements are commonly given as gifts during various occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and other significant milestones. The use of a ribbon in this context serves to add a touch of beauty, elegance, and thoughtfulness to the presentation of the gift. By tying a ribbon around a floral arrangement, the giver effectively elevates the gift's appearance, making it more visually appealing and showing an additional level of care and consideration. Secondly, from a practical standpoint, a ribbon tied around a floral arrangement can help keep the arrangement intact and organized. This can be particularly important when transporting the arrangement, as a loose bunch of flowers is more likely to become damaged or have individual stems fall out of place. The ribbon serves as a functional component that keeps the floral arrangement looking its best. Furthermore, the use of a ribbon also holds symbolic meaning. In many cultures, ribbons represent various notions such as unity, strength, and the binding together of different elements. Incorporating a ribbon into a floral arrangement aligns with these ideas, as it joins the individual flowers together into a cohesive and united display. In addition, customizing the ribbon's color and design can help personalize the gift, allowing the giver to cater to the recipient's unique tastes and preferences. The choice of ribbon can reflect personal sentiments, too – for example, using a specific color to symbolize love, friendship, or sympathy. Lastly, the concept of tying a ribbon around a floral arrangement is steeped in tradition, having been practiced throughout history. Gifting a floral arrangement with a ribbon signifies that the giver respects and follows this time-honored custom, and positions the gift within a broader cultural context. In summary, \\"floral arrangement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense primarily because tying a ribbon around it enhances both the visual and symbolic aspects of the gift. It conveys thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and an adherence to tradition, making it a popular and fitting way to present a floral arrangement as a gift."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usage: In the review, the text \\"Service was incredibly slow\\" clearly shows the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the service quality. This statement meets the criteria of a negative sentiment related to service. Part #3: Evaluation of wait time. Usage: The text \\"We waited over 45 minutes for our food (if not more).\\" portrays frustration from the customer due to a long wait time.

Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.

By 1916, \\"successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousands.\\"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters (a magnificent chateau) of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready), to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill'. Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it. Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill. After explaining to Broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than \\"all the stars and decorations in France,\\" the ambitious Mireau concludes that an attack on the Anthill just might work.Mireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer, Major Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson).

Please answer this question: Who was the original printer of 'Parliamentary Debates', a verbatim record of Parliamentary speeches?","output":"The original printer of 'Parliamentary Debates,' a verbatim record of Parliamentary speeches, was Thomas Curson Hansard. Born on November 6th, 1776, in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe, Surrey, England, Hansard was a British printer and publisher who became synonymous with the publication of the official transcripts of the proceedings of the British Parliament. Thomas Curson Hansard was the son of Luke Hansard, a respected printer who worked with parliamentary materials. Having printing in his blood, young Thomas pursued a career in this field, facilitating his establishment as the proprietor of his own printing house in 1805. Originally located on Great Turnstile Street, Holborn, London, he later moved the business to John Street, Adelphi's premises in 1811. The very first publication of 'Parliamentary Debates' can be traced back to 1803 when William Cobbett, an English journalist, began recording the speeches verbatim. However, legal concerns and financial troubles plagued Cobbett and forced him to sell the copyright to Hansard in 1810. From that point onwards, Thomas Curson Hansard not only printed the records but also published them, significantly impacting the public sphere. In fact, the term 'Hansard' became synonymous with the publication and is still in use today. This historical document contains comprehensive records of all speeches and discussions taking place during parliamentary sessions. Hansard, being an innovative publisher, understood the importance of accuracy and impartiality, which played a vital role in maintaining the credibility of this publication. Hansard continued the task of editing and publishing 'Parliamentary Debates' until his retirement in 1829, leaving a legacy that continues to resonate with both- historians and political activists. His son, also named Thomas, took over the business after his retirement and was responsible for successfully transferring its management to Thomas Curson Hansard Jr., who was in control from 1860 to 1874. Subsequently, it was handed over to the Hansard Publishing Union. Eventually, in 1909, the printing and publishing of parliamentary debates were taken over by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (now The Stationery Office or TSO), and the publication became an official part of government functions. Thomas Curson Hansard's dedication to creating an accurate, transparent, and unbiased record of parliamentary speeches allowed politicians, members of the public, and academics alike to closely follow the proceedings of the British Parliament. Today, 'Hansard' remains a crucial resource for understanding the political evolution and legislative processes in the United Kingdom, as well as in several countries that have adapted the Hansard system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: China has announced it's abolishing its one-child policy. What difference has it made, statistically speaking? 400 million births prevented The one-child policy, officially in place since 1979, has prevented 400 million births. Parents have faced fines and other punishments for having more children. The majority of the decrease in China's fertility rate happened in the 1970s. It dropped from 5.8 children per woman in 1970 to 2.7 in 1978. Despite the one-child policy the rate had only fallen to 1.7 by 2013. 21:28-baby deaths rate Since the one-child policy was introduced, baby girls have become more likely to die than boys. In the 1970s, according to the United Nations, 60 males per 1, 000 live births died under the age of one. For girls the figure was 53. In the 1980s, after the one-child policy became official, the rate for both was 36. By the 1990s, 26 males per 1,000 live births died before the age of one - and 33 girls. The 2000s saw 21 boys per 1,000 live births dying and 28 girls. 1.16 boys born for every girl Sexually selective abortions have been considered as a major cause of China's unusual imbalance. Gietel-Basten, associate professor in social policy at Oxford University, says the births of many girls are not registered if parents have broken the rule by having two children, adding officials often turn a blind eye. It's estimated there are now 33 million more men than women in China. 4: 2: 1 families With the ageing of China's population and the continuation of the one-child policy, a \\"4: 2 :1\\" home is the description given to households in which there are four grandparent, cared for by two working age parents, who themselves have one child. By 2050, it's predicted that a quarter of China's population will be 65 or older.

Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009.  In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s.  In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque. What did this lead him too","output":"It appears there might be some confusion in your question, as it refers to \\"him\\" whereas the preceding information is about Hattie McDaniel, who was a woman. However, assuming you're asking about the implications of Hattie McDaniel's Oscar disappearance, it has led to many speculations, investigations, and continued interest in her life and career. The disappearance of McDaniel's Oscar has created intrigue and opened up many debates about its fate. W.B. Carter's extensive investigation has provided various probable scenarios for its disappearance, debunking prior claims that it was stolen or discarded during civil rights protests. The mystery surrounding the award has kept the narrative of McDaniel's pioneering achievement alive, encouraging continuous discourse around the issues of racial progression, representation, and equality in the entertainment industry. Moreover, the case of the missing Oscar has stimulated interest in McDaniel's life, achievements, and struggles as an African American actress during racially segregated times in Hollywood. This has, in many ways, preserved her legacy and continually highlights her significant role in the industry. She has become a symbol of endurance and perseverance in the face of racial prejudice. The mystery of McDaniel's Oscar has also led to repeated acknowledgments of her contribution, as demonstrated by actress Mo'Nique during her Oscar acceptance speech in 2010. By channeling McDaniel and mentioning her name, Mo'Nique brought renewed attention to McDaniel's historical significance, casting a spotlight on the lingering issues of racial discrimination and the importance of diversity in Hollywood. In summary, the ongoing search for Hattie McDaniel's Oscar has resulted in continued interest in her life, work, and the larger subject of racial bias in the entertainment industry. This sustained interest keeps her legacy alive and reinforces the importance of her contributions, serving as a reminder of the struggles endured by past generations and lending perspective to the continuing fight for equality and representation in the film industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The app offers various statistics, such as which apps consume the most power, as well as providing wakelock information. This helps me to identify battery-draining apps and adjust my usage accordingly. However, there are a few areas where the app could use some improvements. The user interface is a bit cluttered and not very intuitive, making it difficult for me to navigate through the app to find specific details. Additionally, I have encountered occasional glitches and crashes, which can be annoying. Overall, I believe that the BetterBatteryStats app has potential and can be helpful for users looking to manage their battery life more effectively.

Process:  - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose miners extract more happens, how will it affect less coal is removed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process.  Step-by-step justification: Step 1: The mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - If miners extract more coal, the mine may need to be larger or deeper to accommodate the increased extraction rate. This could result in increased resource requirements for excavating the mine and potential geological or environmental impacts. Step 2: Miners enter the mine - With more coal extraction happening, there might be a need for more miners to enter the mine to keep up with the extraction demand. This could lead to potential safety risks, capacity constraints, and increased labor costs. Step 3: Miners remove the coal from the mine - If more coal is removed, it might deplete the coal resources faster than expected, leading to a shorter mine life. Additionally, there could be an increase in worker fatigue due to the increased workload, leading to a higher chance of accidents or health issues for the miners. Step 4: The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - As more coal is extracted, there could be a need for an expanded transport infrastructure (larger carts, more conveyor belts) within the mine to handle the increased volume of coal. Step 5: The coal is moved up to the surface - With increased coal extraction, more equipment or personnel may be needed to move the coal to the surface, resulting in increased operational costs and potential additional safety risks. Step 6: The coal is loaded onto a truck - As more coal is produced, there may be a need for more trucks or more frequent trips to transport the coal, which could lead to increased transportation costs and a higher likelihood of accidents. Step 7: The truck takes the coal to a power station - With more coal being transported, the power station may need to adjust its processes to handle the increased supply of coal, such as expanding storage capacity or modifying their procedures for handling incoming deliveries. In conclusion, the perturbation of extracting more coal can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process, potentially impacting mine excavation, worker safety, resource depletion, transportation infrastructure, and power station operations. It is essential to carefully consider these factors when adjusting coal extraction rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Both sentences describe how Pixar visited the Disney Cruise Line and studied Las Vegas in order to gain a better understanding of artificial lighting. The key difference between the two sentences lies in the use of the prepositions \\"in\\" and \\"for.\\" In the first sentence: \\"Pixar also visited the Disney Cruise Line and studied Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting.\\" The preposition \\"in\\" is used, indicating that the action of understanding artificial lighting was aided by visiting the Disney Cruise Line and studying Las Vegas. This preposition suggests that the assistance provided by these experiences was beneficial during the process of understanding artificial lighting. In the second sentence: \\"Pixar also visited the Disney Cruise Line and studied Las Vegas, which was helpful for understanding artificial lighting.\\" The preposition \\"for\\" is used, suggesting that the action of understanding artificial lighting was facilitated by the experiences of visiting the Disney Cruise Line and studying Las Vegas. This preposition indicates that these visits were helpful towards the ultimate goal of understanding artificial lighting.

First, let's look at it like this:  -4186190 * b + 4185545 * b - 47730 = 0 Now, we have two parts with 'b' in them: -4186190 * b and 4185545 * b We can combine these two parts by simply adding the numbers.  (-4186190 + 4185545) * b = -645 * b So now, our equation looks like this: -645 * b - 47730 = 0 Now, we want to get 'b' all by itself. To do that, let's add 47730 to both sides of the equation: -645 * b = 47730 Finally, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by -645 to find the value of 'b': b = 47730 / -645 When we do the calculation, we get: b = -74 And there you have it!

Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area \\"Djurgårdsstaden\\", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\").

It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidströmer , father of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurgården into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.  From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \\"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\\"  His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \\"promoting\\" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802.  Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (\\"The Prize\\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg.  At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg. Why caused that?","output":"Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann, also known as E.T.A. Hoffmann, got into some trouble when he drew funny pictures, called caricatures, of military officers at a party. People knew he made the drawings and complained to the important people in Berlin. Even though they didn't want to punish him because he was good at his job, they decided to \\"promote\\" him by moving him to a new place called Plock in New East Prussia. This made Hoffmann very sad because he felt like he was sent far away from everyone and everything he knew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Yune Sugihara (Shan Yuan  You Yin , Sugihara Yune), born Yasuhiro Sugihara (Shan Yuan  Kang Hong , Sugihara Yasuhiro, on July 8, 1969 in Hadano, Kanagawa, Japan), known exclusively by his stage name Sugizo, is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, composer, and record producer. He is best known as lead guitarist and violinist of the rock band Luna Sea. After Luna Sea went on break in 1997, Sugizo started his own solo career and opened the independent label \\"Cross\\" to produce other artists, as well as releasing his own records. He points out that the opening of his record label was one of his very important projects at the time, but not anymore. On July 9, his debut single \\"Lucifer\\" was released and reached number 8 on the Oricon singles chart. It was followed by his first solo tour \\"Abstract Day\\" which lasted until the final performance in August at Akasaka Blitz, where he was joined by DJ Krush, Masami Tsuchiya and members of Japan. Then on September 10 he released his second single, \\"A Prayer\\", which reached number 7 on the charts. On November 19, his first solo album Truth? was released, and reached number 12 on the album charts. It was met with mixed reviews, largely because of the unexpected musical style which mixed different genres with electronica beats. A variety of artists participated in the album, from Ryuichi Sakamoto and Mick Karn, to Lou Rhodes and Valerie Etienne. Towards the end of the year, remix editions of his two maxi singles and album were released.  As Luna Sea resumed activities, until the bands disbandement, Sugizo collaborated in the studio with actress Miki Nakatani, and singers Miu Sakamoto and Vivian Hsu among others. On August 11, 1999 a compilation album titled \\"Grand Cross 1999\\", which was sponsored by Sugizo's record label \\"Cross\\", was released, featuring many musicians with whom he had worked with before and many for the first time.  In 2001, he participated in Ryuichi Sakamoto's N.M.L. (\\"No More Landmines\\"), a campaign to promote awareness of the problems of land mines and promote a ban on them, and helped in the making of the album Zero Landmine. He starred in Ken Nikai's movie Soundtrack and composed the music for the film. On November 14, a compilation album inspired by the film, titled Parallel Side of Soundtrack was released, and the following year he released the single \\"Rest in Peace & Fly Away\\" featuring Bice on vocals. That same year he produced the music for, as well danced in, Suichoku no Yume, a production by the popular contemporary dance company H. Art Chaos.

Movie title: A Canterbury Tale Context: St George's Church tower, seen in the film after being gutted in the Baedeker raids (modern photograph) The story concerns three young people: British Army Sergeant Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), U.S. Army Sergeant Bob Johnson (played by real-life Sergeant John Sweet), and a \\"Land Girl\\", Miss Alison Smith (Sheila Sim). The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement \\"next stop Canterbury\\" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform who pours glue on her hair, before escaping. It transpires that this has happened quite a few times before, to other women. Alison asks Bob if he could spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several young boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and borrows the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson's boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper.

The author is expressing their dissatisfaction with how the character Sarah's actions are portrayed in the movie and questions the overall message conveyed by the storyline. Firstly, the use of the term \\"psychotic\\" to describe Sarah's dedication showcases a sense of disapproval, as it contrasts with the idealized notion of romance that is often expected in movies. A psychotic character is typically mentally unstable and exhibits irrational behaviors that may not be relatable or plausible. Consequently, the author is highlighting a significant flaw in Sarah's characterization by asserting that her dedication to finding her husband may not be relatable or even appealing to the audience. Secondly, the author’s mention of the lack of \\"a convincing case\\" demonstrates an overall negative reaction to the movie's narrative. By suggesting that the storyline does not effectively persuade the audience to comprehend or empathize with Sarah's emotional journey, the author is emphasizing the movie's failure in achieving its desired impact. Furthermore, the author raises a question about the thematic priorities of the movie. By stating that \\"one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness,\\" the author implies that Sarah's personal pain seems to be given undue importance compared to the losses portrayed throughout the movie. This assertion contributes to the perception of the sentiment as critical and disenchanted, since it raises concerns about the movie's moral message and the balance between personal emotions and broader events. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative, critical, and disapproving. The author showcases their dissatisfaction with the character's portrayal, the movie's narrative, and its moral priorities. This sentiment analysis offers valuable insights into the potential shortcomings of the movie, as seen from the author's perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

I admit , I welled up a few times during the fireworks and on that train ride . Both for memories I have from my trip with my dad ( recently passed ) and memories we were making with our girls on this trip . A very , very special place Disneyland is . Why would I well up during the fireworks and train ride ?","output":"Based on the context provided, you would well up during the fireworks and train ride at Disneyland for a combination of emotional reasons, primarily rooted in nostalgia and the creation of new memories with loved ones. These emotional responses are influenced by the following factors: 1. Connection to past memories with your father: Given that your father has recently passed away, the experiences at Disneyland might evoke strong memories of the time you spent with him in the same environment. Theme parks, like Disneyland, are filled with shared experiences, laughter, and fun for families and friends. It is natural for you to associate these events with the unforgettable moments you had with your father. As a result, the fireworks and train ride could trigger emotional reactions—such as welling up—due to the bittersweet remembrance of the joyful times you had with your dad. 2. Creation of new memories with your daughters: Experiencing Disneyland with your daughters signifies the passing on of cherished traditions and the creation of new memories as a family. Seeing your children delight in the magic of Disneyland can evoke strong emotions, especially when it reminds you of your own childhood experiences with your father. The fireworks and train ride, being symbolic representations of these special memories, might cause you to well up as you recognize the significance of sharing similar experiences with your own children. 3. Disneyland as a symbol of happiness and family bonding: Disneyland is well-known for being a place that brings people together and encourages family bonding and togetherness. The atmosphere of the park, the enchanting attractions, and the shared experiences serve as poignant reminders of the importance of maintaining strong connections with our loved ones. As you take part in the spectacle of the fireworks and the train ride, you might be overcome with emotion as Disneyland has a unique ability to amplify feelings of happiness, love, and appreciation for the special moments we spend with our family and friends. 4. Emotional impact of the fireworks and train ride: Both the fireworks display and train ride may hold emotional significance in and of themselves. Fireworks are a symbol of celebration, wonder, and awe, while the train ride may represent a journey and the passing of time. Witnessing these events might evoke deep emotional reactions due to their inherent beauty and the feelings they evoke. This, combined with the emotional connections to your father and the new memories being created with your daughters, would likely make these experiences particularly poignant and lead you to well up during these special moments. In conclusion, the feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions during the fireworks and the train ride at Disneyland is likely a result of the connection between your past memories with your father, the ongoing formation of new memories with your daughters, and the powerful impact of the theme park's atmosphere and attractions. The amalgamation of these factors creates an emotional experience that can indeed make Disneyland a very special place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Alec Miran, the special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, had been negotiating with the Chinese to try to stay on the air.

Based on the sentence \\"Two dogs in harnesses running in tall grass.\\", is the sentence \\"The dog are not on the asphalt.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Based on the initial sentence, \\"Two dogs in harnesses running in tall grass,\\" we have information that indicates a specific situation involving two dogs - they are in harnesses and are running in tall grass. Now, considering the second sentence, \\"The dog are not on the asphalt,\\" the focus is slightly different - it talks about a dog (or potentially multiple dogs, assuming a typo leading to \\"The dogs are not on the asphalt\\") and highlights that these dogs are not on the asphalt. While the first sentence does not explicitly mention anything about asphalt, it does give us information about the dogs' environment. As they are running in tall grass, one can logically infer that the environment they are in is likely to be a field, a meadow, or a similar natural setting, which would strongly suggest the absence of asphalt. It is essential to consider the context and the possible scenarios before making any conclusions. Here's an analysis of potential situations: 1. If the second sentence is taken to mean a general statement that seems unrelated to the first sentence: In this case, we cannot definitively conclude whether the two sentences are related or unrelated. 2. If the second sentence refers to the same dogs as the first sentence: In this case, we can reasonably infer that the sentence \\"The dog(s) are not on the asphalt\\" is true. This is because the second sentence complements the information provided in the first sentence - if two dogs are running in tall grass, it is highly likely that they are not on the asphalt. In conclusion, if we assume that the second sentence refers to the same dogs mentioned in the first sentence, we can assert that \\"The dog(s) are not on the asphalt\\" is a true sentence. The primary reasoning behind this conclusion is that the two dogs in question are running in tall grass, which suggests a natural setting where asphalt is unlikely to be present."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Seeking a fresh start, he plans an escape - a vacation to the charming, historic city of Charleston, South Carolina. John's marriage has been on the rocks, so he takes this opportunity to embark on the trip alone, hoping to find solace and a way to ease his guilt over Mark's death. Upon arriving in Charleston, John is captivated by its beauty and rich history. He makes the decision to stay at a charming bed and breakfast surrounded by ancient oaks and cobblestone streets. The owner, Mrs. Ella Whitmore, a 60-year-old widow with a love for old-world charm and historical tales, warmly welcomes John. Act 2: During his stay, John starts exploring the city, visiting the famous Battery Park and Drayton Hall. While having lunch in a quaint cafe, he overhears a conversation about a mysterious local legend that dates back to the 1700s. Intrigued by the story, John delves into the history of Charleston and discovers that the city is believed to have connections to the early Freemasons. John soon finds himself pulled into the world of Charleston's Freemasons, learning that they allegedly buried a priceless relic – an ancient, powerful jewel – somewhere in the city. However, before John sets out on his quest to find the hidden treasure, he encounters a beautiful antique shop owner named Grace during one of his daily strolls. The two immediately hit it off and begin to bond over their love for Charleston's history. Act 3: As the mysteries of the relic unfurl, John becomes significantly more involved in solving the riddle of its location. While exploring the city's underground tunnels with Grace's help, John stumbles upon Mark's old Freemasonry medallion, only to learn that Mark's ancestors were also linked to the order. John's belief that Mark's death and their visit to Charleston were fated grows stronger, as does his love for Grace. A shadowy group of men - the current protectors of the ancient relic - are revealed to be watching John's every move, willing to do whatever it takes to keep the priceless jewel's location a secret. Enigmatic warnings begin to appear around them, encouraging John to turn back, lest he meets a fate similar to Mark's. Act 4: Unfazed by the veiled threats and driven to uncover the truth, John and Grace soon find themselves in a dangerous game of cat and mouse against their foes. They outwit the shadowy group, following clues and solving riddles that lead them closer to the relic. As John and Grace discover the truth, the rival group corners them, but they are miraculously saved by Mrs. Whitmore, who reveals herself to be a descendant of the original Freemasons and the protector of the hidden jewel. With the relic finally in their possession, John, Grace, and Mrs. Whitmore make the decision to keep the jewel's existence a secret, guarding it from those who wish to harness its power. John, having found love, closure, and a renewed sense of purpose in Charleston, returns to New York City with Grace and a newfound appreciation for life, love, and the mysteries hidden within the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Determine what type of paint remover you will use. Article:","output":"Title: Choosing the Right Paint Remover for Your Project Introduction: When it comes to removing paint from various surfaces, having the appropriate paint remover is an essential part of the process. With numerous paint removers available in the market, selecting the right one for your project can be a daunting task. This article will guide you through the process of determining the most suitable type of paint remover to use, considering factors such as the type of surface, the paint being removed, and safety concerns. Step 1: Examine the surface Before choosing a paint remover, it's crucial to examine the surface that requires paint removal closely. The type of surface will play a significant role in determining the most appropriate paint remover for successful and safe paint stripping. - For wooden surfaces, consider using a solvent-based paint remover, followed by sanding to achieve a smooth result. However, be cautious of potential damage to the wood if used too aggressively. - For metal surfaces, chemical paint removers are a common choice. These removers break down the paint's bond with the metal surface, making it easier to clean off. - For more delicate surfaces like plastic or fiberglass, it is best to choose a non-abrasive paint remover to avoid damaging the surface. Step 2: Identify the type of paint Understanding the type of paint that needs to be removed is also a vital factor in choosing the right paint remover. Different paint types require different removal methods for optimal results. - For oil-based paints, a solvent-based paint remover is typically the most effective option. - For latex or water-based paints, a water-based paint remover will often suffice, proving to be less harsh on surfaces. - For more stubborn paint types like epoxy or polyurethane, a stronger paint remover may be necessary, such as a chemical-based remover. Step 3: Consider safety concerns Safety should always be at the forefront of any project. When working with paint removers, take into account any potential hazards or health concerns associated with using these products. - Opt for eco-friendly or low-VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) options when available. These paint removers will have fewer harmful fumes and lessen the environmental impact of your project. - Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, and a mask when handling paint removers, particularly those with strong chemicals. - Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, ensuring proper use and disposal of the paint remover. Step 4: Test the paint remover Before committing to a specific paint remover, it's always wise to test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the surface. This will help you gauge its effectiveness and ensure that it does not cause any damage to the surface in question. Conclusion: Ultimately, selecting the right paint remover for your project requires thoughtful consideration of various factors such as the type of surface, paint, and safety concerns. Through careful research and testing, you can ensure that you choose a paint remover that effectively and safely completes your project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose Long term smoking shrinks the blood vessels happens, how will it affect the salt does not separate.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The process you've described is distillation, which is a common method for desalinating water, or removing salts and other impurities. Your question seems to inquire about the relationship between long-term smoking and effects on this desalination process, and specifically on the separation of salt from water.  To answer your question, let's first understand what long-term smoking does to the human body. Among many other detrimental health effects, long-term smoking indeed restricts the blood vessels. This condition is also known as vasoconstriction. While vasoconstriction has severe physiological implications, it does not directly affect the process of water desalination at a factory or plant. The typical water desalination process includes steps such as pre-treatment, desalination, post-treatment, and waste disposal. The desalination step often involves heating the saltwater solution to a high temperature, causing the water to evaporate while leaving the salts and other impurities behind. The water vapor is then collected and condensed back into liquid form, while the salt is typically separated manually and removed. This process is largely mechanical and chemical in nature. The primary driving factors in the separation of salt from water in this process include temperature, pressure, and the inherent physical and chemical properties of the components involved (water, salt, and any other compounds present). Human physiological states like those induced by long-term smoking, such as vasoconstriction, do not interact with these factors.  This differs to situations where human physiological changes might influence a process; for example, how dehydration might affect kidney function, or how vasoconstriction might affect blood flow. In comparison, the process of mechanical desalination in a factory is independent of changes in human physiology. In summary, the supposed perturbation of long-term smoking and resulting vasoconstriction would have no effect on the separation of salt from water in a factory desalination process. It's crucial to understand that while long-term smoking has serious health implications, including vasoconstriction, these physiological effects don't influence industrial processes like desalination."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who suggested that clarinetists, by virtue of their not being tied to the melody as much as cornetists and trumpet players, could explore harmonies , can you please find it?   Like Green, who made particular mention of Beiderbecke's \\"amount of teaching,\\" the jazz historian Ted Gioia also has emphasized Beiderbecke's lack of formal instruction, suggesting that it caused him to adopt \\"an unusual, dry embouchure\\" and \\"unconventional fingerings,\\" which he retained for the rest of his life. Gioia points to \\"a characteristic streak of obstinacy\\" in Beiderbecke that provokes \\"this chronic disregard of the tried-and-true.\\" He argues that this stubbornness was behind Beiderbecke's decision not to switch from cornet to trumpet when many other musicians, including Armstrong, did so. In addition, Gioia highlights Beiderbecke's precise timing, relaxed delivery, and pure tone, which contrasted with \\"the dirty, rough-edged sound\\" of King Oliver and his protégé Armstrong, whose playing was often more energetic and whose style held more sway early in the 1920s than Beiderbecke's. Beiderbecke's playing - both as a cornetist and a pianist - had a profound effect on a number of his contemporaries.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that has their name changed in Denise Waverly?  The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.  Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.

(1) He refugeed and returned to Italy , where he retired for two years to private life . (2) He retired to Italy where he escaped and returned to private life for two years . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences appear to convey similar information, there are subtle differences in their meaning and structure. Let's break each sentence down to analyze the variations: 1. \\"He refugeed and returned to Italy, where he retired for two years to private life.\\" - In this sentence, the subject \\"he\\" is described as taking refuge, which implies facing a situation requiring asylum or protection.  - The individual returns to Italy, with the sentence specifying that the return to Italy is related to the act of taking refuge. - Upon returning to Italy, the subject retires to private life for two years. This indicates a withdrawal from public life or professional responsibilities during that period. 2. \\"He retired to Italy where he escaped and returned to private life for two years.\\" - In this sentence, retirement is the initial action, and the individual retires specifically to Italy. - Instead of seeking refuge, the subject escapes, which implies evasion or fleeing from something. This escaping could be related to their retirement, but it is not explicitly stated. - As with the first sentence, the subject participant returns to private life for two years, presumably after escaping, and withdraws from public or professional engagements. To summarize, both sentences convey the idea that the subject returned to Italy, retired from public life, and experienced two years of private life. However, they differ in other aspects. Here's how: - Sentence 1 directly links taking refuge with returning to Italy, and implies this was an act of seeking protection or asylum.  - Sentence 2 focuses on escaping rather than taking refuge, suggesting the subject evaded an undesirable situation instead. Additionally, retirement is mentioned as the initial action in sentence 2, separate from the escape. These nuances change the overall interpretation of each sentence and as such, the statements don't mean exactly the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Build a movie plot around this: Who wrote the autobiography that \\"Before Night Falls\\" is based off of? Reinaldo Arenas","output":"Title: \\"Breaking Free: The Life of Reinaldo Arenas\\" Genre: Biographical Drama Step 1: Introduce the main character The movie begins with a striking portrayal of Reinaldo Arenas (played by an upcoming Latin actor), a Cuban poet, novelist, and playwright, growing up in rural poverty during the 1940s and 1950s. We see a young Reinaldo exhibiting an incredible talent for writing and a passion for literature. Step 2: Establish the historical context The film depicts the early days of Fidel Castro's revolution, which initially captivated  and inspired Arenas, as well as other Cuban intellectuals, who believed that it would bring positive changes to the lives of ordinary people. The film highlights the optimism of the era by showcasing the excitement and fervor surrounding the revolution. Step 3: Introduce the main conflict As the regime becomes increasingly repressive, particularly towards intellectuals and LGBTQ+ individuals, Arenas finds himself a victim of the very revolution he once supported. He is targeted, marginalized, and persecuted, not only for his fierce intellect and subversive words, but also for his homosexuality. Step 4: Show the impact of persecution The movie delves into the harsh realities faced by Arenas under the repressive regime, including his escape from prison, hiding from authorities, and eventual exile from Cuba. Throughout this gripping narrative, the film showcases the resilience and strength of Reinaldo Arenas, who clings to his art as a means of survival, even in the face of immense suffering. Step 5: Focus on the creative process While the movie's main plot follows Arenas' personal struggle for freedom, it also celebrates his creative accomplishments and offers audiences a window into his revolutionary literary work, including the writing of his autobiography, \\"Before Night Falls.\\" We see Arenas' unrelenting dedication to writing, unapologetically sharing his experiences and ideas with the world despite the odds against him. Step 6: Depict Reinaldo Arenas' final years The film concludes with a portrayal of Arenas' life in exile in the United States, as he battles the double-edged sword of newfound freedom and a diagnosis of AIDS. In the face of this adversity, Arenas continues to write and share his work with the world, refusing to ever let go of the hope for a better Cuba. Step 7: Tie the movie back to the source material In the final scene, Reinaldo Arenas completes his autobiography, \\"Before Night Falls,\\" the very book which inspired this movie. This poetic and powerful ending serves as a testament to Arenas' indomitable spirit, ensuring that his legacy will continue to inspire future generations. Throughout the film, we emphasize the transformative power of art, the endurance of the human spirit, and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, even in the face of great adversity. This movie not only tells the extraordinary story of Reinaldo Arenas, but also captures the universal struggle for freedom and self-expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Captain Nairic, an undercover intelligence officer, was abducted, tortured, and murdered in May 1977 by the IRA. His remains, like those of many other victims, have never been found. The Disappeared: The term \\"the Disappeared\\" refers to a group of people who are believed to have been abducted, murdered, and then secretly buried by militant organizations during the Troubles between 1969 and 1998. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, established in 1999, is dedicated to locating and identifying the bodies of the Disappeared. To date, 16 victims out of a total of 20 listed have been found and returned to their families for burial, while four others, including Captain Nairic, remain unaccounted for. Captain Robert Nairic - A Tragic Tale: Robert Nairic, a 28-year-old captain in the British army's Grenadier Guards, was working as an undercover intelligence officer when he was abducted by the Provisional IRA from a pub in South Armagh on May 14, 1977. He had entered the pub alone, using a fake identification and posing as Danny McErlane while attempting to gather sensitive information. Nairic was taken to another location, where he was brutally tortured for several hours before being shot dead. His captors hoped to extract crucial information about other undercover operatives in the area, but Nairic did not divulge any details. His battered body was later discovered near the border with the Republic of Ireland. To this day, the exact location of his remains remains a mystery. The Appeal for Public Help: As part of the ongoing search efforts, the ICLVR has released an appeal for any information that may lead to the discovery of Captain Nairic's remains. The Commission has had previous success in locating the bodies of other victims with the assistance of information from the public, and they are hopeful that someone may hold the vital clue needed. Geoff Knupfer, the lead investigator with the ICLVR, stated, \\"His killers know where they put his body. Only they can tell us, either directly or indirectly through a third party, the ICLVR or a trusted individual, where it is so we can find him, take him back to his family and provide a Christian burial.\\" The Commission guarantees complete confidentiality to anyone who provides information and reiterates that their sole purpose is to recover the remains of the victims, not to pursue criminal prosecutions. This appeal is a chance for those with knowledge of Nairic's final resting place to step forward without fear of reprisal. The Ongoing Search for Closure: The search for Captain Robert Nairic and other Disappeared victims highlights the painful legacy of the Troubles, and the ongoing effort to provide closure to the families who have suffered for decades. The Commission, along with the victims' families, can only hope to bring some measure of solace and resolution through the discovery and return of their loved ones' remains. Conclusion: The urgent appeal for information in locating the remains of Robert Nairic is an important reminder of the ongoing commitment to providing justice and closure for families of the Disappeared. As the search continues, it is essential that any information, no matter how small, is used to finally bring peace to those who have been waiting for so long. It is the responsibility of those who have knowledge of the whereabouts of the victims to come forward and help end this painful chapter of Northern Ireland's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are differences in both the intended action and the route taken by the Sabres. Let's break them down and see what each sentence means: 1. In order to preserve the neutrality of Malaysia, the Sabres were flown to Singapore via Thailand. 2. In order to maintain Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore. While both sentences mention the overarching goal of preserving or maintaining Malaysia's neutrality, they differ in the following aspects: 1. Action difference: In the first sentence, the word \\"preserve\\" is used, expressing the effort to keep something in its original state and prevent any changes. In the second sentence, the word \\"maintain\\" is used, indicating the ongoing effort to sustain Malaysia's neutrality. Although similar, \\"preserve\\" conveys a stronger need for protection, while \\"maintain\\" suggests a more active and continuous process. 2. Route difference: In the first sentence, the Sabres' destination is Singapore, and they travel there via Thailand. This means that the Sabres pass through Thailand on their way to Singapore. In the second sentence, however, the destination is Thailand, with the Sabres passing through Singapore on their way to Thailand. These two flight paths are distinctly different and lead to different end locations.

Given the question: Information:  - The Peerage of England comprises all peerages created in the Kingdom of England before the Act of Union in 1707. In that year, the Peerages of England and Scotland were replaced by one Peerage of Great Britain.  - The Peerage of Great Britain comprises all extant peerages created in the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Act of Union 1707 but before the Act of Union 1800. It replaced the Peerages of England and Scotland, until it was itself replaced by the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1801.  - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.  - Thomas Thynne , 1st Marquess of Bath KG ( 1734 -- 1796 ) was a British politician who held office under George III serving as Southern Secretary , Northern Secretary and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . Between 1751 and 1789 he was known as The Viscount Weymouth . He is often best known for his role in the Falklands Crisis of 1770 .  - The Kingdom of Ireland (Classical Irish: '; Modern Irish: ') was a client state of the Kingdom of England that existed on Ireland from 1542 until 1800. It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown.  - The partition of Ireland was the division of the island of Ireland into two distinct jurisdictions, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. It took place on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Today the former is still known as Northern Ireland and forms part of the United Kingdom while the latter is a now sovereign state also named Ireland, formally known as the Republic of Ireland.  - The Chief Secretary for Ireland was a key political office in the British administration in Ireland. Nominally subordinate to the Lord Lieutenant, and officially the \\"Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant\\", from the early 19th century until the end of British rule he was effectively the government minister with responsibility for governing Ireland; usually it was the Chief Secretary, rather than the Lord Lieutenant, who sat in the British Cabinet. The Chief Secretary was \\"ex officio\\" President of the Local Government Board for Ireland from its creation in 1872.  - Marquess of Bath is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1789 for Thomas Thynne, Viscount Weymouth. The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles Baron Thynne, of Warminster in the County of Wiltshire, and Viscount Weymouth, both created in 1682 in the Peerage of England. He is also a baronet in the Baronetage of England.  - Lord Lieutenant was the title of the chief governor of Ireland from the Williamite Wars of 1690 till the Partition of Ireland in 1922. This spanned the Kingdom of Ireland (15411800) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (18011922). The office, under its various names, was often more generally known as the viceroy, from the French \\"vice roi\\" or deputy king, and his wife was known as the vicereine. The government of Ireland in practice was usually in the hands of the Lord Deputy up to the 17th century, and later of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. Although in the Middle Ages some Lords Deputy were Irish noblemen, only men from Great Britain, usually peers, were appointed to the office of Lord Lieutenant.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922.

The leaking of secret surveillance techniques by Edward Snowden has made the world a more dangerous place, a top officer warned last night. Cressida Dick said the former US National Security Agency contractor’s disclosures, printed by The Guardian newspaper, caused ‘enormous damage’ and ‘hand[ed] the advantage to terrorists’. The Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner added: ‘The so-called Snowden revelations have made our work more difficult. The actions he took helped to signal to people who may try to do us harm  how to avoid surveillance and other techniques. Former CIA agent Edward Snowden made the world a more dangerous place. through leaking secret surveillance techniques, a top officer has warned. ‘In my view that is not going to make the world safer, it is going to make it more dangerous. It has affected public confidence in our abilities to do a job that I believe we do carefully, proportionately and using our powers sparingly within the law.’ Speaking to a meeting of police chiefs in her last days as Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Miss Dick said the police were ‘staring into the abyss’ because of a political deadlock over access to sensitive internet communications. Terrorists and other top-level criminals were taking advantage of rapidly changing technology to evade the security services. Cressida Dick, Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner, told police chiefs that the leaks had affected public confidence in police abilities. Politicians must get to grips with laws allowing police to use so-called ‘communications data’, Miss Dick said, adding that terrorist investigations will be hampered unless police and spies can retain data, including internet browsing and emails. She said: ‘I believe that as technology changes, we are beginning to stare into the abyss. Make no mistake, continuing erosion of this capability without the necessary legislative changes will severely impact on our ability to continue terrorist investigations.’ Asked about the outbreak of extreme violence in Iraq, Miss Dick said the security services were watching the ‘ghastly conflagration’ closely. She said: ‘It is clearly an enormous world-changing event which will have all sorts of ramifications and it may or may not heighten the risk to the UK of terrorism.’ She added that police had no information yet that British jihadists have travelled from Syria to join the wave of barbaric Islamist fighters. But she said police were conscious that hundreds of Britons fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad could move and threaten other areas in  the world. Miss Dick also appealed to the Government to leave terrorism units in the hands of police forces, including the Met, rather than hand them to the National Crime Agency. She said a ‘messy divorce’ risked making the police response to complex terrorist threats less effective and more difficult to co-ordinate. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth.

Strickland was captured Jan. 15 in El Paso. Above, Strickland walks into the El Paso County Jail escorted by the FBI agents who captured him. (Photo: MARK LAMBIE/EL PASO TIMES)      For the second time in less than a year, a Milwaukee homicide suspect has been arrested after being added to the FBI's \\"Ten Most Wanted\\" list.      Terry A.D. Strickland, 24, who is wanted in a double killing, was captured early Sunday in El Paso, Texas, the FBI announced.      When he was added to the most-wanted list last month, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said he was accused of having \\"cold-bloodedly killed\\" two innocent men, Maurice Brown Jr. and Michael Allen Reed.      Strickland was among a group of men arguing in front of a Milwaukee home July 17 when witnesses saw him go inside the house, emerge with a gun and fire into the small crowd, officials said.      Strickland then approached Brown, 38, who was laying on the ground, and shot him multiple times before turning to Reed, 39, and shooting him in the head, according to authorities.      Strickland fled in a black SUV, abandoning his 18-month-old daughter who was inside the house, officials said.      \\"I am ecstatic that he's been arrested for the murder of my son,\\" said Reed's mother, Janice Reed, on Sunday after a reporter told her the news.      \\"My son can rest now,\\" she added.      Flynn described the crime as \\"vicious\\" and \\"unnecessary.\\"      \\"Neither individual posed the slightest threat to Mr. Strickland, but they paid with their lives for occupying the same space,\\" he said.      After the FBI got a tip on its public access line, agents learned on Saturday that Strickland was possibly living in El Paso. Law enforcement officers worked throughout Saturday and into Sunday to locate him before arresting him at 5:10 a.m. during a traffic stop, according to a news release from the FBI. Strickland was arrested without incident.      Strickland had been arrested earlier in 2016, before the double homicide, after he reportedly pointed and aimed a gun at another person, police said. The victim did not cooperate and charges were not filed.      Strickland was the second Milwaukee homicide suspect added to the FBI's most-wanted list within a six-month period.      Last summer, Shanika Minor was arrested in North Carolina within a week of being added. She is charged with fatally shooting her mother's nine-months-pregnant neighbor, Tamecca Perry, hours after Minor confronted the woman with a complaint about loud music.      Minor was the seventh Wisconsin fugitive to appear on the FBI list since its inception in 1950 and the first from Milwaukee. Her jury trial is scheduled to begin in February.      A reward was paid out to an individual who provided information leading directly to Minor's arrest, an FBI official said last month. A 100,000 reward was being offered in the Strickland case but it was not immediately clear Sunday afternoon if anyone had a claim to it.      When Strickland was added to the list, Flynn said the Police Department has a \\"very positive relationship with the FBI\\" and the agencies are members of the same local task forces.      \\"I'd like to believe part of our working relationships contributed to the fact that this is the second individual Milwaukee has been able to place on the most-wanted list just this year,\\" Flynn said last month.      Strickland was charged in July in Milwaukee County Circuit Court with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the case. An arrest warrant was issued at that time. In October, he was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and another arrest warrant was issued.      Federal officials said Strickland, who grew up outside Chicago, had ties to Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. Authorities have not publicly said what Strickland was doing in El Paso, which is on the border with Mexico.      \\"It was one month ago, to this day, that we added Terry A.D. Strickland to the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted,\\" Milwaukee FBI Special Agent in Charge Justin Tolomeo said in a statement. \\"I am proud of the continuous hard work of our agents and law enforcement partners in quickly apprehending this dangerous and violent fugitive.\\"      Meg Jones of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Aaron Martinez of the El Paso Times contributed to this report.

This occurs when rock formations break and move due to the stress and strain built up within the Earth's crust.  In addition, Fact 2 states that earthquakes and volcanoes are evidence of Earth's shifting crust, implying that movement is responsible for these events. The movement of tectonic plates, which make up the Earth's crust, is driven by various processes such as the convection of the Earth's mantle beneath them.

Question: Who is the carrier of Ananka's soul? Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

It is also keen on promoting / selling you some products like thera-bands. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"This review depicts the product in a somewhat unflattering light, primarily for the following reasons: 1. Limited practical applications: The reviewer clearly states that, while the book is useful for developing self-awareness about one's body, it lacks practical exercises to help improve one's dance. This implies that the book may not meet the expectations of readers looking for a more comprehensive guide on dance-related exercise and improvement. 2. Focus on promoting products: Another negative point mentioned in the review is the book's emphasis on promoting or selling additional products, such as thera-bands. This could be off-putting for potential readers, as it may raise concerns about the author's motivation and the overall value of the book's content. 3. Comparison to another work: The reviewer compares this book to Mary Bond's \\"New Rules of Posture.\\" By doing so, they suggest that the book has similarities to another work but does not provide unique insight or a fresh perspective on the subject matter. This could be interpreted as the book lacking originality and offering only an average contribution to the field. However, it is essential to consider that the review does highlight some positive aspects of the book, such as its usefulness in developing self-awareness about one's body. This indicates that the book may still be of value to readers interested in gaining knowledge about body awareness and may provide a foundation for further exploration of dance techniques and exercises. In summary, this review paints the product in a primarily unflattering light, mainly due to shortcomings in providing practical dance exercises and an emphasis on promoting additional products. However, there is still some value to be derived from the book's focus on developing body self-awareness. Overall, potential readers should weigh both the positive and negative aspects of this review before deciding whether this book could effectively meet their needs and expectations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010.

More significantly, its military performance proved far better than during the War of the Austrian Succession and seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms.

Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \\"Flash Alf\\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \\"that whiskered baboon\\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban.

Wir haben große Schwierigkeiten, uns ausreichende Kenntnis von dieser transnationalen Kriminalität zu verschaffen, denn unsere Ordnungskräfte sind ja national organisiert und arbeiten innerhalb ihrer eigenen Grenzen. Translate this to English?","output":"We have great difficulty in gaining sufficient knowledge of this transnational crime because our law enforcement agencies are organized nationally and operate within their own borders. The statement highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in tackling transnational crime. Transnational crime refers to criminal activities that span across multiple countries, which can include activities such as human trafficking, drug smuggling, cybercrime, and terrorism. These types of crime require a high level of coordination and cooperation between law enforcement agencies in different countries to effectively address them. One of the obstacles mentioned in the statement is the national organization of law enforcement agencies. Each country typically has its own set of rules, regulations, and law enforcement bodies that govern and oversee crime within their respective borders. This includes the police, customs, immigration, and other similar agencies. Their main focus is on maintaining order and safety within their jurisdiction, which can often limit their ability to tackle criminal activities that involve other countries. To effectively address transnational crime, there needs to be strong cooperation and communication between the law enforcement agencies of various countries. This can occur through information sharing, joint investigations, mutual legal assistance, and other collaborative efforts. In particular, international organizations like INTERPOL or Europol can play a crucial role in coordinating efforts to tackle transnational crime. These organizations facilitate communication and cooperation between law enforcement agencies across different countries, providing essential support and resources in the fight against transnational criminals. Furthermore, addressing transnational crime requires a comprehensive approach that combines the efforts of law enforcement, justice, and other relevant sectors. This includes implementing preventive measures to reduce opportunities for criminals to exploit cross-border vulnerabilities, strengthening border control and security, and capacity building to enable countries to effectively investigate, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal networks. In conclusion, tackling transnational crime is a complex and challenging task for law enforcement agencies, especially due to their national organization and limited jurisdiction. Encouraging collaboration and cooperation between countries, as well as leveraging resources provided by international organizations, are necessary steps to overcome these challenges and effectively combat transnational criminal activities. This requires not only a strong commitment from governments, but also comprehensive strategies that combine preventive, operational, and legislative measures to dismantle criminal networks and ensure a safer and more secure global community."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],E={key:0},N={key:1};function G(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
