This example assumes you have the historical data of your cryptocurrency in a CSV file with at least the columns: `Date` and `Close`. Adjust the code as necessary for your specific dataset and requirements. First, let\'s import all necessary libraries: ```python import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` Then, load your dataset and preprocess it: ```python # Load the dataset df = pd.read_csv(\\"your_crypto_data.csv\\") # Selecting the \'Close\' column and converting it to numpy array close_prices = df[\'Close\'].values.reshape(-1, 1) # Scale the data between 0 and 1 scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(close_prices) # Creating the dataset with 30 timesteps x = [] y = [] for i in range(30, len(scaled_data)): x.append(scaled_data[i-30:i, 0]) y.append(scaled_data[i, 0]) x, y = np.array(x), np.array(y) # Splitting the dataset into training and testing x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Reshape the data to fit the LSTM layer x_train = np.reshape(x_train, (x_train.shape[0], x_train.shape[1], 1)) x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (x_test.shape[0], x_test.shape[1], 1)) ``` Now, let\'s build the LSTM model: ```python model = Sequential() # Adding the first LSTM layer with some Dropout regularisation model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 1))) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) # Adding a second LSTM layer and some Dropout regularisation model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False)) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) # Adding the output layer model.add(Dense(units=1)) # Compiling the RNN model.compile(optimizer=\'adam\', loss=\'mean_squared_error\') # Fitting the RNN to the Training set model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32) ``` Finally, let\'s make predictions and visualize them: ```python predicted_prices = model.predict(x_test) predicted_prices = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_prices) # Undo the scaling # Visualising the results plt.plot(scaler.inverse_transform(y_test.reshape(-1, 1)), color=\'red\', label=\'Real Crypto Price\') plt.plot(predicted_prices, color=\'blue\', label=\'Predicted Crypto Price\') plt.title(\'Crypto Price Prediction\') plt.xlabel(\'Time\') plt.ylabel(\'Crypto Price\') plt.legend() plt.show() ``` Before running this code, please make sure to install the necessary Python packages if you haven’t done so: ```bash pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib ``` This code serves as a basic template. Depending on your dataset and specific requirements, you may need to adjust the model architecture, hyperparameters (like `epochs`, `batch_size`, number of `units` in LSTM layers), or preprocessing steps. LSTM models can be quite sensitive to these parameters, so experimentation is key to finding the best setup for your particular dataset."},{"instruction":"A Latte Art Love Affair: Where Every Sip is a Masterpiece., generate a description","output":"In the heart of a bustling city, tucked away in a cozy nook, lies a magical café where your morning brew is more than just a drink—it\'s a piece of art.

Tools like nm, readelf and objdump can fulfill this job. Target function address is 08049196, now construct the attack string using your program. And store it in the attack_string file. Your program should be named as attack and take the target function address as the input. For example if 0xdeadbeaf is the target function address, and your code is written in python, then run \\"python3 attack.py deadbeef\\" will create an string stored in attack string file to be further used to exploit the vulnerability in the vulnerable program. The following will try to help you understand how to construct an attack string: Stack layout of vulnerable program contains buf which is 4 bytes, Other vars which is 8 bytes, %ebp which is 4 bytes, %eip and &arg1 while the prompt function invoking. The goal is to overwrite the buffer until return address(%eip) on the stack has contains the target function address. Based on this, construct you attack string carefully. One thing to be aware is the address in little-endian format. For example, if target address is ”0xdeadbeef”, then the bytes of return address at RA will be RA[0]:ef, RA[1]:be, RA[2]:ad, RA[3]:de. Stack layout of launching shellcode contains buffer, return address %eip, nop nop nop....., injected code. Overwrite the buffer in a specific way that: 1. Overwrite the buffer with padding. 2. Overwrite the return address(%eip) on the stack with a guessed address that probably will jump to the injected malicious code. 3. nops(0x90) can be filled in the between the return address and injected malicious code to increase the chance that injected malicious code will be executed. The nop instruction will do nothing but jump to the instruction. 4. The shellcode then provided as payload at the end of the overwrite.

Работая в архиве мореходного музея, она каждый день натыкалась на древние карты, дневники капитанов и рассказы о путешествиях, которые укрепляли в ней желание увидеть все это своими глазами. Однажды, перебирая стопку старинных писем, Елена наткнулась на записку, оставленную неким капитаном Грей, который утверждал, что нашёл обломки древнего корабля, грузившегося золотом и драгоценностями неведомой цивилизации. Годами этот рассказ не давал Елене покоя. Она начала собирать информацию, изучала карты тех времён и искать свидетельства той загадочной экспедиции. С каждым днём, проведённым в архивах и библиотеках, убеждённость в существовании затонувшего сокровища только укреплялась. И вот, спустя несколько лет, обладая солидным объёмом знаний, Елена решает, что пора переходить от слов к делу. Она ушла с работы в музее, продала свою небольшую квартиру и автомобиль, чтобы финансировать свою экспедицию. Елена нашла единомышленников - группу исследователей и моряков, разделяющих её увлечения и мечты. Вместе они арендовали небольшое судно, оснастили его всем необходимым для длительного путешествия и поисков под водой. Самое сложное было решить, куда именно направиться. Капитан Грей в своей записке оставил очень туманные указания, но, основываясь на обрывочных данных и личных догадках, Елена выбрала курс на один из малоизученных участков Карибского моря, где, как предположила, могли обитать древние торговцы, чьи корабли могли истекать чудесами и богатствами. Путешествие было долгим и наполнено трудностями. Штормы, технические неисправности и разногласия в команде испытывали решимость и веру Елены в то, что они на правильном пути. Но её упорство и вера в мечту оказались заразительны. Каждое утро она встречала с надеждой и неумолимо вела свою команду вперёд. И однажды их терпение и настойчивость были вознаграждены. Обнаружив под водой необычные формации, они спустили водолазов, которые вскоре подняли на поверхность первые находки — предметы, чья историческая и культурная ценность была несомненна. Невозможно было описать те чувства, которые переполняли Елену, когда она, наконец, коснулась того, о чём мечтала так долго. Это путешествие стало не только достижением её личной мечты, но и важным научным открытием, которое принесло Елене признание в научном мире. Но для неё самой главным сокровищем было осуществление мечты и уверенность в том, что даже самые смелые путешествия начинаются с первого шага."},{"instruction":"A Latte Art Love Affair: Where Every Sip is a Masterpiece., generate SEO\'s, tips, how you can sell, strategies, platform to use to sell like amazon store, keywords for instagram, keywords for instagram, etsy, and other ecommerce social media","output":"Creating engaging content around the theme of \\"A Latte Art Love Affair\\" offers an exciting opportunity to captivate a dedicated audience of coffee enthusiasts and art lovers.

B. mit dem viel zitierten und viel verlangten Alternativangebot des Räte-kommunismus (in Westdeutschland aus Berührungsangst häufig Rätedemokratie genannt). Vielmehr gilt es, in der Konfliktpraxis, in den autonomen Organisatonsbestrebungen der Arbeiter, in der neuen Form der Selbstorganisation im Reproduktionsbereich, in der Bewegung der abhängigen Massen zu experimentieren, innerhalb welcher realen Grenzen und in welcher Richtung eine gesellschaftliche Reproduktion in Formen möglich ist, die nichts mehr zu tun haben mit der alten Form der Herrschaft durch Vertretung. Am Ende noch eine Bemerkung, die zum Thema zurück-führt. Es wurde bemerkt, daß ein Volk von 60 Millionen sich nur über Vermittler regieren läßt. Lenin selbst hat andererseits bekanntlich die Notwendigkeit von Delegation hervorgehoben. Und oft greift man gerne auf Lenin zurück, um die zeitlose Notwendigkeit des Parlamentarismus für eine „rational“ ver-faßte Gesellschaft zu betonen. Indessen bedeutet Delegation in keiner Weise Repräsentation im politisch-parlamentarischen Sinn des Wortes, da „Repräsentation“ (ohnehin Stellvertretung und nicht unmittelbare Vertretung) sich immer mit spezifischen Macht- und Herrschaftsstrukturen verbindet. Das, was man Herrschaft durch Vertretung nennen kann (Marx nannte es den „politischen Staat“), als organisatorische Form kapitalistischer Gesellschaften, kam eindeutig in dem programmatischen Text der fraglichen Tagung zum Ausdruck: „Es war nie das letzte Ziel des Parlamentarismus, Vertretung und Herrschaft abzuschaffen.“ Gewiß hat das auf allgemeines Wahlrecht gegründete Reprä-sentativverfahren viel zur Milderung der Herrschaftsstrukturen des ancien regime beigetragen. Das wollen wir keineswegs vergessen. Noch mehr, es schafft dem Klassenkampf politische Räume, deren Weite erst an der Enge und an der Einschnürung faschistischer Regime sich messen läßt, auch wenn man nicht vergessen soll, daß die Tendenz in Richtung auf neue Formen der Einschnürung und der Schließung solcher Räume geht. Mit dem Delegationsprinzip - angenommen, es sei unvermeidlich - fällt dies alles aber nicht zusammen, sofern dieses Prinzip nicht die Milderung der Herrschaft, sondern deren Absterben intendiert. Das Problem liegt genau in dieser Perspektive: Das Verhältnis zwischen Delegation von Entscheidungsbefugnissen und Absterben der Herrschaft vom Ziel des Absterbens her zu bestimmen und experimentell zu verwirklichen. Nur wird sich die konkrete Seite dieses Verhältnisses kaum durch akademische Diskussionen klären, noch durch philosophische Ableitungen oder durch hilfreiche Konstruktionen System- oder modelltheoretischer Art simulieren lassen. Allerdings muß gegenwärtig bleiben, daß es im Interesse der Gesellschaftsordnung, in der wir leben, oder in Klartext gesprochen, daß es im Interesse des Kapitals liegt, alle Erfahrung eines Absterbens der Herrschaft zu verhindern (selbst im kleinen - daher die Angriffe auf alle Autonomiebestrebungen); und die sozialen Spannungen, die ihnen zugrundeliegende Rebellion gegen das Kapital zu kanalisieren, auf Pseudokonflikte oder Marginalkonflikte umzupolen - wie dies immer in einem Wahlkampf vor sich zu gehen pflegt. Die empirisch-soziologische Analyse will nachweisen, daß der Wahlkampf an sich „insignifikant“ ist. Wir müssen vielmehr darüber im klaren sein, daß gerade in seiner unmittelbar erfahrbaren Unbedeutsamkeit sich dessen versteckte politische Bedeutung verbirgt.”翻译为中文","output":"通过一个词来说：问题（我们的问题）无法仅通过向公众提供一个选项来解决——例如，经常被引用和强烈要求的苏维埃共产主义的替代方案（在西德，因接触恐惧症，经常被称为苏维埃民主）。相反，我们需要在冲突实践中、工人的自治组织努力中、在再生产领域的新自组织形式中，在依赖群众的运动中进行实验，试验在哪些实际边界内以及在哪个方向上，一种与旧的代表统治形式无关的社会再生产是可能的。 最后还有一点，这将我们带回主题。有人评论说，一个6000万人口的国家只能通过中介来治理。另一方面，列宁本人显然强调了代表制的必要性。而且，人们经常乐于引用列宁，以强调议会制对于一个“理性”构建的社会的永恒必要性。然而，在政治-议会意义上的“代表”（即使是代替而非直接代表）总是与特定的权力和统治结构相结合的，代表制绝不意味着代表。所谓的通过代表进行统治（马克思称之为“政治国家”），作为资本主义社会的组织形式，在所讨论的会议的纲领性文本中被明确表达：“议会制从来不是为了废除代表和统治而存在。” 当然，基于普遍选举权的代表制程序极大地缓和了旧制度的统治结构。我们绝不忘记这一点。更重要的是，它为阶级斗争创造了政治空间，这些空间的广度只有与法西斯主义政权的狭隘和限制相比较才能衡量，尽管我们不应忘记，趋势是朝向新形式的限制和关闭这些空间的方向发展。假设代表原则是不可避免的，这一切都不会因为它而改变，只要这一原则不是为了减轻统治，而是旨在统治的消亡。 问题正是在这个视角中：从统治消亡的目标出发，确定决策权限代表与统治消亡之间的关系，并通过实验实现这一关系。只是这种关系的具体方面几乎无法通过学术讨论、哲学推导或通过系统论或模型理论类的有益构建来澄清。然而，必须一直清楚，对我们生活中的社会秩序，或者直白地说，对资本的利益来说，防止任何形式的统治消亡的经验（即使是在小范围内——因此对所有自治努力的攻击）；以及将基于反对资本的叛乱所产生的社会紧张状态，转向伪冲突或边缘冲突上——正如选举战中经常发生的那样。 实证社会学分析旨在证明，选举战本身是“无关紧要的”。我们必须清楚地认识到，正是在它直接体验到的无足轻重中，隐藏着其隐蔽的政治意义。"},{"instruction":"请将“AUF DEM WEG ZUR UNMITTELBAREN DEMOKRATIE? I Ich schulde meinem Vorredner, Herrn Leisner, großen Dank. Nach dem, was er gesagt hat, dürfte für mich nicht viel übrig bleiben. Er hat schon vorweggenommen, was ich in der Kon-zeption dieses Kongresses hätte leisten sollen: die in der ersten Gesprächsrunde nackt dargestellte Schönheit des Grundgesetzes mit einem ornamental-kritischen Feigenblatt zu verzieren. Wissenschaft soll plural und abgewogen sein. Nun hat also Leisner das Feigenblatt geliefert - nur in einer ganz anderen Richtung als der möglichen meinen. Der Beifall der mutmaßlich eher kritischen Zuhörer mag der Offenheit seiner Aussage gegolten haben. Meinte er aber den Inhalt, so läge Selbsttäuschung oder Mißverständnis vor. Leisners Thesen, daß im Zeichen des Grundgesetzes nicht der demos, sondern Minderheiten herrschen, wollte wohl nicht Mißstände denunzieren, sondern Zustände bejahen: eine Laudatio der Wirklichkeit, verbunden mit der beruhigenden Zusicherung, daß die Bundesrepublik sich keineswegs auf unmittelbar - demokratischen Abwegen befände. Bei der Feststellung der wirklichen Lage des gemeinen Volks wurde derart die Lebenslüge enthüllt, die in der Präambel unseres Jubilars enthalten ist: Das deutsche Volk habe sich sozusagen vollverantwortlich ein Grundgesetz gegeben und also von Anfang an seine, des Volks und seiner Mehrheit, Souveränität vollzogen. Mitnichten, weder durch die direkte Wahl einer verfassunggebenden Versammlung, noch durch die direkte Abstimmung über einen dem Volk vorgelegten Verfassungsentwurf. Das will heißen, daß unser Jubilar in Wirklichkeit vom Volk weder gegeben noch gewollt wurde, vielmehr einen klassischen Fall von oktroyierter, verfassungsähnlicher politischer Ordnung darstellt; was über die Qualität derselbigen fraglos nichts aussagt und ebensowenig ausschließt, daß das Grundgesetz später die Zustimmung der Bevölkerung erfahren hätte. Die nachträgliche Legitimation wurde reichlich eingebracht, bis hin zu einem beinah total zu nennenden Konsensus. Sollte es jetzt mit dem Konsens zu Ende gehen, sollte sich eine ebenso totale Konfliktualität anmelden, die Unmittel-barkeit durchbrechen? Bei der Behandlung des Themas - die zugleich eine Kritik am Grundgesetz einschließen sollte - emp-finde ich doch eine gewisse Verlegenheit. Wenn ein geschicht-liches Institut Geburtstag hat, sollte korrekterweise nur Lob gespendet werden, wie bisher in der Tat schon geschehen, wenn auch in der Form des Repetitoriums längst bekannter ideologischer Positionen. Ich habe keine Schwierigkeiten, ins allgemeine Lob einzustimmen. Das Geburtstagskind scheint mir sich der besten Gesundheit zu erfreuen. Ich wundere mich eher über all das, was so nebenbei und kassandrisch über Verfallserscheinungen, Krankheitssymptome und alternative Abgründe dahergeredet wurde. Man stand knapp vor dem magischen Ort der Unregierbarkeit. In Wirklichkeit leben wir in einem politischen System, das in einem ziemlich hohen Grad funktionstüchtig und funktionsfähig ist. Also: Das Grundgesetz hat sich in dieser Hinsicht bewährt. Allen Befürchtungen zum Trotz garantiert das von ihm be-stimmte „Ordnungsgefüge“ (so heißt es wohl) genau das, wozu es strategisch institutionell da ist. Nicht etwa die Menschenrechte. Diese gewiß auch, sofern sie seinem funktionsgerechten Handeln dienlich sind1, in erster Linie aber die geordnete, friedliche, soweit wie möglich von destruktiven Konflikten frei gemachte Reproduktion unserer Gesellschaft. Da bleibt mir jeder Versuch, gewissermaßen Weimar herbei-zuprojizieren, gänzlich unverständlich. Wie kann jemand, der nicht bloß fiktive Gefahren an die Wand malt, um seine Forderung nach dem starken Staat zu begründen und durchzusetzen, auf den Gedanken einer erneuten „Krise des Parlamentarismus“ und einer real vorhandenen Gefährdung des grundgesetzlichen Systems kommen, nur weil einer vorläufig unbotmäßig sich gebenden Bewegung es gelungen ist, das heilbringende Hindernis des Quorums zu überspringen, oder gar weil APO-Reminiszenzen immer noch im Hinter- oder Untergrund Geschichte zu machen drohen - oder zu machen scheinen. Von einer, durch außerinstitutionelle Kräfte und Gruppen verursachten Krise des politischen Systems mögen die Innenminister und das Bundeskriminalamt, sprechen. Die Bevölkerung nimmt das kaum zur Kenntnis - und hat ohnehin andere Sorgen. II Uber diese Sorgen will ich versuchen, Anschluß an mein Thema zu finden, ohne übrigens den erwarteten Rahmen des polito- logischen Raisonnements zu verlassen, ohne also Ausflüge in die Tiefe sozioökonomischer Bedingtheiten zu unternehmen - also mit Goethe gesprochen, ohne in die Basis, zu den Müttern, hinabzusteigen. Erstens: Ist es Ulk, Scherz oder hat es eine tiefere Bedeutung, daß manchenorts an der Freien Universität der Titel des schönen Kongreßplakats „Konsens und Konflikt“ überklebt wurde mit dem Satz „Flick und Nonsens“? Ist die Bevölkerung der Bundesrepublik wirklich beunruhigt von der Möglichkeit, daß im Spannungsfeld zwischen Konflikt und Konsens sich Risse in der politischen Ordnung auftun, oder gilt die Sorge anderen Problemen? Ich meine hier nicht die Arbeitslosigkeit und deren Folgen, die atomare Aufrüstung und deren Gefahren. Vielmehr und formell im Politischen verbleibend, denke ich an die, für viele von uns brüchig gewordene Glaubwürdigkeit der politischen Klasse, an die in brutaler Form offenkundig gewordene Verfilzung von Geld und Macht, von Kapital und Staat. Daraus kann die Glaubwürdigkeit des Verfassungsstaats eher Schaden nehmen als aus den ebenso spektakulären wie vernunftlosen Bombaroladen. Zweitens: Eben darum ist an meinem Thema nur das Frage-zeichen richtig. Wenn wir uns überlegen, was unmittelbare Demokratie bedeuten könnte im allgemeinen Verstände des Wortes (über mein eigenes Verständnis später ganz kurz kritisch): mehr Partizipation der Bürger, größeres Gewicht der Bedürfnisse der „Betroffenen“ (ein Ausdruck, der inzwischen zur normalen Bürokratensprache verkommen ist), Beteiligung an Entscheidungsprozessen (an welchen freilich: ob eine Straße nach Ernst Thälmann oder sagen wir nach Ludwig Erhard benannt werden soll) - so fragt sich, ob dies alles überhaupt Aktualität und Substanz zeigt und in der Lage ist, politische Glaubwürdigkeit wiederherzustellen. Erhöhte Partizipation findet in der Tat schon allenthalben statt, aber in der Form der Informatik, der elektronischen Datenverarbeitung, der Computerisierung der Bevölkerung, des fälschungssicheren Ausweises, also in der Form zunehmender Partizipation des staatlichen Machtapparats an gesellschaftlichen Prozessen und am Alltag eines jeden. Ohne die Grundrechte prinzipiell und formell in Frage zu stellen, beteiligen sich der Staat, die Rechtsordnung, das Polizeiwesen und diverse Schutzinstanzen an unserem Leben, greifen permanent in unsere „unmittelbaren” Entscheidungen ein. Die Omnipräsenz der freiheitlich-demokratischen Grundordnung und deren Macht- und Amtsträger weitet sich aus zur zunehmenden Verstaatung der Gesellschaft: zur berühmten „Landnahme“, emblematisch und hautnah erfahrbar an den Universitäten, denen im gleichen Atemzug größere Autonomie und verordnete Strukturierung gegeben werden. Wir sind also auf dem Weg der vermittelten Verstaatung - durch jene Minderheiten vermittelt, von denen Leisner sprach. Sie scheint mir um so interessanter und durchgreifender zu sein, als sie sich nicht als Idealisierung und Potenzierung des Staats ausgibt (da wäre sie nämlich handgreiflich faßbar); viel-mehr und erstaunlicherweise unter der politisch-ideologischen Parole des „Abbaus des Staates“ daherkommt. Aber es liegt hier kein Widerspruch vor. In der institutionellen Strategie bürgerlicher Staaten bedeutet Abbau des Staates nie dessen Abschwächung. Der starke Staat deckt sich durchaus mit dem „schmalen“ Staat, der gerne Entscheidungskompetenzen an (eben verstaatete) gesellschaftliche intermediäre Instanzen weitergibt, sofern es sich um Entscheidungen in sekundären Bereichen handelt. Das Primäre bleibt beim Staat. Erst dadurch werden Basis-Wildwuchs und Zugang der Massen zu den Machtzentren verhindert: Zu Brot und Spielen kommen noch die Bürgerinitiativen hinzu.”翻译为中文","output":"**在直接民主制的道路上？** **一** 我欠我的前辈雷斯纳先生一个大大的感谢。在他说过的之后，对我而言似乎没有剩下太多可以讲的了。他已经提前表达了我在本次会议概念上本应完成的任务：用一片装饰性批判的无花果叶来装点第一轮对话中裸露展示的基本法之美。科学应当是多元和审慎的。现在雷斯纳提供了那片无花果叶——只不过是朝着一个可能与我不同的方向。 那些可能更加批判性的听众们的掌声，可能是针对他陈述的坦率。但如果是针对内容的话，则可能是自欺欺人或是误解。雷斯纳的论点，即在基本法的标志下不是人民而是少数派统治，似乎并非要揭露弊端，而是肯定现状：这是对现实的赞誉，伴随着安慰人心的保证，即联邦共和国绝不走上直接民主的歧途。 在确立普通民众实际状况时，因而揭示了我们的基本法导言中包含的生活谎言：德国人民好像全权给予自己一部基本法，从一开始就实践了人民及其多数的主权。不尽然，既没有通过直接选举一个宪法制定大会，也没有通过直接对提交给人民的宪法草案进行投票。这意味着，我们的庆典主角实际上既非人民给予也非人民所愿，更多地代表了一种被赋予的、类似宪法的政治秩序案例；这无疑不涉及其质量，也不意味着基本法后来没有获得人民的认可。事后的合法化已经充分实现，达到几乎可以说是全民共识的地步。 如果现在共识即将结束，是否就意味着全面的冲突性开始，直接性贯穿其中？在处理这个主题时——同时应包含对基本法的批评——我确实感到有些尴尬。当一个历史机构庆祝生日时，按道理只应该给予赞美，如迄今为止确实已经做到的，尽管形式上是重复已知的意识形态立场。我没有难度加入普遍的赞美之中。对我来说，生日的主角似乎正享受着最佳的健康。我更感到惊讶的是，所有这些关于衰落迹象、疾病症状和替代性深渊的陈述，似乎是随意而语重心长地提及的。我们几乎站在了无法治理的神奇地带的边缘。实际上，我们生活在一个功能相当高效和有能力的政治系统中。 所以：在这方面，基本法已经证明了自身的价值。尽管有所有的担忧，由它确定的“秩序架构”（这应该是它的称呼）确切地保证了它策略性、机构性存在的目的。不是人权——当然也包括人权，只要它们对它的功能性行动有益——而是首先确保我们社会的有序、和平、尽可能避免破坞性冲突的再生产。 因此，任何试图将魏玛共和国的情况投射到这里的尝试，对我来说完全是不可理解的。一个人如何能够，仅仅因为一个暂时不服从的运动成功地跨过了有益的限额障碍，或者因为APO的回忆仍然在历史的表面或底层造成威胁——或者看似如此——就认为存在对基本法制度的“议会危机”和真实的威胁，而不仅仅是为了宣传强国政府的需求和实现这一目标而制造虚构的危险？内政部长和联邦刑警局可能会谈论政治系统由非机关力量和团体引起的危机。公众几乎不会注意到这些——而且无论如何有其他的担忧。 **二** 关于这些担忧，我将试图找到接近我的主题的方法，同时不偏离预期的政治学推理框架，即不深入到社会经济条件的深处——用歌德的话说，不下到基础，到母亲那里。 首先：这是笑话、玩笑，还是具有更深层次的意义，某些地方在自由大学的美丽会议海报标题“共识与冲突”上被覆盖了“Flick和Nonsens”（小把戏和胡说）的话？德国联邦共和国的民众真的因为政治秩序中可能出现裂痕的冲突与共识领域而感到不安，还是关注其他问题？这里我不是在谈论失业及其后果，核武器升级及其危险。更准确地，保持在政治形式上，我在想对于我们许多人来说，政治阶层的可信度变得脆弱，资金与权力、资本与国家之间以粗暴形式明显的勾结。这可能会对宪法国家的信誉造成更大的损害，而不是那些同样引人注目但无理的炸弹事件。 第二：正因为如此，我的主题中唯一正确的是问号。如果我们考虑一下直接民主可能在一般意义上意味着什么（稍后再简要批判性地谈谈我的个人理解）：市民更多的参与，受影响人“需求”的更大权重（一个现在已经沦为常规官僚用语的表达），参与决策过程（但究竟是哪些决策：是否应该将一条街以恩斯特·泰尔曼或比方说路德维希·艾哈德命名）——我们不禁要问，这一切是否真的有实际意义和实质，是否能够恢复政治的可信度。实际上，增加的参与已经无处不在，但以信息学、电子数据处理、人口计算机化、防伪身份证的形式，即以国家权力装置对社会过程和每个人日常生活的越来越多的参与形式。在不从原则上和形式上质疑基本权利的情况下，国家、法律秩序、警察和各种保护机构持续介入我们的“直接”决策。自由民主基本秩序及其权力和职官的无处不在性扩展为社会的逐渐国家化：在大学中体现和切身体验到的著名的“土地占领”，同时在同一口气中给予更大的自治和规定的结构化。 我们因此在通过中介的国家化道路上——通过雷斯纳所说的那些少数派来中介。我发现这一点尤其有趣且深刻，因为它并不以国家的理想化和放大自居（那样的话它会是实实在在的）；奇怪的是，它在政治-意识形态的“国家削减”口号下进行。但这里没有矛盾。在资本主义国家的机构策略中，削减国家从不意味着减弱国家。强大的国家与“瘦小”的国家完全一致，后者乐于将决策权力（在次要领域）移交给（即便是国家化的）社会中介机构。主要权力仍归国家所有。这样，基层的迅猛发展和大众进入权力中心的可能性被防止了：除了面包和游戏，还有市民倡议。"},{"instruction":"请将“III An dieser Stelle verdeutlicht sich der grundgesetzkonforme Charakter der heute praktizierten und verlangten Basisdemo-kratie und des heute geforderten Plebiszits. Beide sind instru-mentell in den gegebenen Verfassungsstaat einbringbar, sie lassen sich mühelos in das System einbinden (System übrigens systemisch und nicht weimarerisch gemeint) und tragen zum besseren Funktionieren eines, mit Randproblemen nicht weiter belasteten Staats bei. Befürchtungen gegenüber der Delegierung sekundärer Entscheidungen nach unten und gegenüber dieser Form der unmittelbaren Demokratie sind widersinnig: Da wird keine Republik verändert, die bestehende eher befestigt und verfestigt in ihrer Funktion, die politische Energie auf den Zuwachs der innen- und außenstaatlichen Macht zu konzentrieren, wie auf die Aufrechterhaltung bürgerlich-kapitalistischer Strukturen - bekanntlich auch eine „Basis“. Das wäre eine erste, längst fällige kritische Bemerkung zum Thema. Nun eine zweite Bemerkung - auf die andere Richtung hin, im Hinblick auf schon praktizierte Unmittelbarkeit. Was sich in der Forderung nach Basisdemokratie konkretisiert und das Entgegenkommen des Staats schon findet (von den Deponie-fragen über den Umweltschutz bis hin zu den Frauenhäusern und der neuen Frauenpolitik der alten Parteien), erscheint beim ersten Zusehen als Ausweitung der gesellschaftlichen Autonomie („es wird immer mehr von unten her entschieden“). In der Wirklichkeit verwandelt sich die Autonomie in die eingegliederte Subsidiarität. Die Beteiligung wird institutionalisiert, in eine rechtliche Form gegossen und zu einem geregelten und kontrollierbaren Institut des Staats gemacht. Sie verliert mit anderen Worten genau ihre Qualität, staatsfreie, machtpolitisch nicht tangierbare Räume zu schaffen und auszuweiten. Ein Beispiel, wie diese Strategie funktioniert, wie also eine von unten gebildete Form gesellschaftlicher Selbstentscheidung und Selbstbestimmung durch eine Verrechtlichung vom Staat förmlich übernommen und von der politischen Klasse aufgesogen wird, liefern uns die Vorgänge um die italienischen „Zonenräte“ - die consigli di zona. Die consigli di zona, aus den revolutionären Umtrieben der 60er Jahre und aus dem heißen Herbst des italienischen Klassenkampfs entstanden, bildeten in ihren Anfängen die Fortsetzung der autonomen Fabrikräte in die Gesellschaft hinein. Sie entsprachen auch organisatorisch den Fabrikräten und waren durch die gleichen Strukturen charakterisiert, die die hegemoniale Stellung der Fabrikräte gegenüber dem Kapital und ebenso gegenüber den traditionellen Arbeiterorganisationen ausmachten. Es handelte sich um die gleichen Strukturen, die die basisdemokratischen Vorstellungen hierzulande bestimmen: freie Listen, Rotation, jederzeitige Abwählbarkeit der Delegierten, jederzeitige Einberufung der Zonenversammlungen und dergleichen mehr. Die Zonenräte hatten nicht nur die Aufgabe, die Probleme der Wohnviertel vor Ort zu erkennen und zu lösen; genauso vertraten sie als außerinstitutionelle Instanzen die Interessen und die Bedürfnisse der Zonenbevölkerung gegen die städtische Verwaltung, gegen den Staat und nicht zuletzt gegen die Staatsparteien. Letztere blieben organisatorisch draußen vor der Tür; Ein-gang fanden sie nur in der Profilierung als Personen und in der Klassengebundenheit. Es wurden also „staatsfreie“ gesellschaftliche Organe geschaffen - und phantasiereiche Interpreten verglichen die Zonenräte mit der außerinstitutionellen Instanz der römischen tribuni plebis. Was ist inzwischen daraus geworden? Sobald sie gesellschaftliche Wirksamkeit und Aktionsfähigkeit zeigten, wurden sie nicht mehr vom Staat als illegal betrachtet und von den Parteien als regelwidrige Konkurrenz bekämpft. Man fing vielmehr an, sich um sie zu „bemühen“, ihnen Anerkennung zu zollen und sie in einen langsamen institutionellen Prozeß der Landnahme (der Verstaatung) hereinzuziehen, an dessen Ende das rechtlich geregelte Staatsinstitut stand, dessen Wahlen zum Beispiel schlicht an die Kommunalwahlen gekoppelt wurden. Einmal staatsrechtlich und rechtsstaatlich formalisiert, sind sie inzwischen nichts weiter als bürgernahe, betroffenheitsorientierte Unterabteilungen der ganz normalen Stadtverwaltungen, in denen sich die Parteien herumtummeln und sich Klientele schaffen, ganz nach dem normalen Bild des (natürlich italienischen) Verfassungsstaates. Die unmittelbare Demokratie kehrte - gewiß unfreiwillig - in das Prinzip der Parteienvermittlung und der staatlich vorgegebenen Repräsentation zurück. IV Dieser Vorgang: Die Reintegration der autonom gewordenen Gesellschaft in den Staat, die zweifellos einen Sieg des parla-mentarischen Regimes und des Parteiensystems gegen verän-dernde Umtriebe darstellt, gibt Anlaß zu einer dritten kriti-schen Bemerkung über westdeutsche Projekte und Wünsche, die eine anders geartete Politik herbeiführen möchten. Sie scheitern (und lassen sich ohne große Mühewaltung wieder vereinnahmen) schon auf der Ebene des Bewußtseins. Die unmittelbare Demokratie weiß selber nicht, was sie ist oder sein soll. Besser gesagt: Die unmittelbaren Demokraten, so sie parteiförmig organisiert und parlamentarisch präsent sind, verfügen nur über sehr unklare Vorstellungen ihrer eigenen Pläne, Hoffnungen, Bedürfnisse. Es fehlt ihnen am Begriff, da die harte Wirklichkeit nicht erkannt wird, die Erkenntnis zuweilen ohnehin durch dumpfe Gefühle ersetzt wird. Emblematisch dabei ist die Verwirrung in den entsprechenden Diskussionen und Klärungsversuchen, mit der die Basisdemokratie und das Plebiszit durcheinander geworfen werden. Daß es sich um ähnliche Forderungen handelt: Die Bevölkerung soll direkt entscheiden, will ich gar nicht bestreiten. Dennoch geht es dabei um zwei Formen des politischen Lebens und zwei Formalisierungen des Entscheidungsprozesses, die dem Programm nach und von der Formseite her durchaus in Widerspruch zueinander geraten. Denn Basisdemokratie bedeutet im wesentlichen die Möglichkeit des gemeinen Volkes, an der Basis der Gesellschaft - und diese Basis ist in sich strukturiert, bildet keine konturlose Ebene, auf der sich individuelle Atome tummeln, sondern ist organisatorisch und materialiter verbandlich und lokal gegliedert - ohne Einmischung staatli-cher, übergeordneter, das große Ganze verkörpernder Organe die eigenen Angelegenheiten selbst zu regeln. Daß institutionell auch ein Weg zu den allgemeinen Angelegenheiten, zur Republik gesucht werden muß, steht außer Frage. Fundamental bleibt aber, daß zur Basisdemokratie auch eine sehr weitgehende Dezentralisierung gehört. Eine zentralistische Basisdemokratie ist ein schwarzer Schimmel. Und da liegt der Punkt, an dem die Basisdemokratie sich mit der plebiszitären beißt: Plebiszitäre Demokratie ruft die ganze Plebs auf den Plan, und nicht nur die unmittelbar Betroffenen; läßt das ganze Volk über die Startbahn-West entscheiden, und nicht nur die Frankfurter Ausflügler. Sie ist also eine zentrali-stische Institution. Die Schwierigkeiten der unmittelbaren Demokratie, diese zwei Formen miteinander zu koppeln (eine wahrhaft geschichtliche Aufgabe), besteht für eine reformfreudige repräsentativbürokratische Demokratie nicht. Auf dem Weg zum starken Staat ist es durchaus möglich, sich beider zu bedienen, sie zu Verfassungsinstituten zu machen. Was ich vorhin über die Verlegung sekundärer Entscheidungen auf die untere Ebene sagte, gilt auch für die Einführung eines unverbindlichen Volksbegehrens. Auch hier finde ich die Kassandrarufe widersinnig - abgesehen davon, daß sie von der Legende (um nicht zu sagen: von der Lüge) leben, die Volksentscheide hätten die Weimarer Republik zerstört. Ob das eine oder andere verwirklicht wird, liegt nicht im Wesen des Grundgesetzes, sondern in der machtpolitischen Opportunität, mit dem entsprechenden parlamentarischen Quorum über die Ergänzung, Ausweitung und Änderung des besagten Wesens zu beschließen. Und das Quorum wird gegen die hier vorgetragenen Bedenken von Hofmann sehr schnell erreicht, wenn die von Leisner so plastisch analysierten Machtminderheiten sich kluge Gedanken machen über die staatspolitisch-wertmoralische Nützlichkeit eines plebiszitären Ventils. Genau so wie bei der Basisdemokratie, kommt es auch in diesem zweiten Fall der Unmittelbarkeit nicht auf das Plebiszit an, sondern auf dessen institutionelle Eingrenzung und Instru- mentalisierbarkeit, vor allem in der Sicht, die Wähler bei einem Referendum dennoch unter Kontrolle zu halten. Italia docet.”翻译为中文","output":"**三** 在这里，今天实践和要求的基础民主制与公民投票的符合基本法的特性变得明显。两者都可以工具性地融入现有的宪政国家，它们可以轻易地被整合进系统中（顺便说一句，这里的系统是指系统性的，而不是魏玛式的），并有助于一个不再被边缘问题困扰的国家更好地运作。对于向下级别代理次要决策以及对这种形式的直接民主的恐惧是毫无道理的：这并没有改变任何共和国的性质，相反，它在其功能上加强和巩固了现有状态，即将政治能量集中在增强国内外权力上，以及维持资产阶级-资本主义结构——众所周知的也是一种“基础”。这是关于这个话题的第一个早该提出的批评性评论。 现在提出第二个评论 - 朝着另一个方向，关于已经实践的直接性。那些在基础民主化的要求中具体化，并且已经获得国家容纳（从垃圾填埋问题到环保，再到女性庇护所及老党派的新女性政策)的事物，在第一眼看去似乎是社会自治范围的扩大（“越来越多的决策由底层决定”）。但实际上，自治正在转变为被吸纳的辅助性角色。参与被制度化，被融入法律形式，并变成了国家控制和可监管的机构。换句话说，它准确失去了创造和扩展与国家无关、政治力量无法触及空间的质量。意大利的“区域委员会”（consigli di zona）的事件向我们展示了这种策略如何运作，即如何将一种自下而上形成的社会自我决策和自我决定的形式通过法律化由国家正式接管，并被政治阶层吸收。 “区域委员会”，起源于60年代的革命动荡和意大利阶级斗争的热烈秋天，初期延续了自主工厂委员会进入社会的形式。它们在组织上类似于工厂委员会，具有相同的结构特征，这些结构特征构成了工厂委员会对资本以及传统工人组织的主导地位。这些结构特征也决定了我们这里的基础民主的想法：自由候选名单、轮换制、代表随时可被解职、区域大会随时召开等等。区域委员会的任务不仅是识别和解决居民区的问题；它们作为非制度化的机构，同样代表区域居民的利益和需求对抗城市管理、对抗国家，尤其是对抗国家党派。 后者在组织上被排除在外；只有作为个人和阶级属性才能入内。因此，创建了“非国家”社会机构——而且富有想象力的解释者将区域委员会与罗马的平民保护官（tribuni plebis）这一非制度化机构相提并论。结果如何呢？ 一旦它们显示出社会影响力和行动能力，它们不再被国家视为非法，也不再被政党视为规则之外的竞争对手。相反，人们开始“关注”它们，给予它们认可，并将它们吸纳进一个缓慢的国家化的制度过程中，在这一过程的最后，成为了法律规定的国家机构，其选举例如简单地与市政选举挂钩。一旦成为国家法律和法治正式化的组成部分，它们现在不过是普通市政管理的亲民、关注受影响问题的部门，在其中各个政党活动，建立自己的客户群，完全按照（当然是意大利式的）宪政国家的常规模式。直接民主制——无疑是无意中——回归到了党派调解和国家规定的代表制原则之中。 **四** 这一过程：自治社会被重新整合入国家，无疑代表了议会制和党派系统对变革动向的一次胜利，这引发了我对希望实现不同政策的西德项目和愿望的第三次批判性评论。它们在意识层面上就失败了（并且可以轻易地再次被同化），因为直接民主制自身不知道它是什么或应该是什么。更确切地说：那些以党派形式组织并在议会中有表现的直接民主者，对自己的计划、希望、需求只有非常模糊的概念。他们缺乏对硬性现实的认识，而这种认识有时甚至被模糊的感觉所取代。在这里标志性的是有关基础民主和公民投票的相应讨论和澄清尝试中的混乱，它们被混为一谈。 这里涉及相似的要求，即人民应该直接做出决定，我并不否认。然而，这涉及到两种政治生活的形式和两种决策过程的形式化，按计划和形式上完全有可能相互矛盾。因为基础民主实质上意味着普通人民在社会基础上——这个基础本身是有结构的，不是一个没有轮廓的平面，在这个平面上个别原子聚集在一起，而是组织上和物质上是团体和地方性的——无需国家的干预、没有上层代表整体的机构的干涉，自己管理自己的事务。毫无疑问，机构上也必须寻找到通往共同事务、通往共和国的途径。但根本的是，基础民主还包括非常广泛的去中心化。中央集权的基础民主是个矛盾。 这就是基础民主与公民投票制相冲突的地方：公民投票式的民主将全体民众召唤到场，而不仅仅是直接受影响的人；让全体人民对西启动道（Startbahn-West）做出决定，而不仅是法兰克福的郊游者。因此，它是一种中央集权的机构。 直接民主制面临的困难，在于将这两种形式结合在一起（一个真正的历史性任务），对于一个改革热衷的代表性官僚民主国家来说，不存在这样的问题。在走向强国的道路上，完全有可能同时利用这两者，将它们变成宪法机构。我之前关于将次级决策下放到底层的说法，也适用于引进非约束性的民众提议。在这里，我也发现卡珊德拉式的警告是无意义的——除了它们依赖于这样一个传说（不妨说：谎言），即公民投票摧毁了魏玛共和国。 是否实现这一点或那一点，并不在于基本法的本质，而在于根据相应的议会门槛来决定对该本质的补充、扩展和修改的政治机会。当雷斯纳如此生动地分析的权力少数派对于公民投票的国家政治-道德效用的明智思考时，这个门槛将迅速达成，尽管有霍夫曼提出的反对意见。就像在基础民主的情况下，这第二种直接性情况下，重点不在于公民投票本身，而在于其制度化的限制和工具化的可能性，特别是在公投中仍然控制选民的视角。意大利是个教训。"},{"instruction":"请将“Damit hätte ich mein Thema abgehandelt. Die unmittelbare Demokratie, auf deren Weg sich die Bundesrepublik angeblich befindet, steht weder als solche auf der Tagesordnung noch ist sie, sofern formell verwirklicht, eine solche. Es bleibt aber noch ein Punkt, eine ganz anders geartete, jenseits des Themas und des Jubiläums sich entwickelnde Möglichkeit. Basis- und gesellschaftliche Autonomie, Unmittelbarkeit und Zwangsfreiheit der Reproduktion mögen in ihrer politischen, genauer gesagt, politik-kritischen Übersetzung heute noch allerhand Fehler aufweisen, unsichere und ungesicherte Perspektiven eröffnen. Sie stellen indes gegen die Organisationsform des Verfassungsstaates eine durchgängige Alternative dar. Insofern ist es durchaus richtig, in ihnen eine künftige Gefährdung des grundgesetzlichen Systems zu sehen - die eigentliche Konfliktquelle und die wirkliche Aufkündigung des Konsenses. Aus solchen, ich betone: alternativ, und nicht systemkonform erhobenen Forderungen (wie sagte doch eine grüne Abgeordnete: Sie habe «den alten Kasten», also den Bundestag, inzwischen richtig lieb gewonnen) können Prozesse entstehen, die zur Destabilisierung führen, die Destabilisierung zu einer Strategie machen können, um eine - wie man so zu sagen pflegt - andere Republik aufzubauen. Oder am Ende eine richtige res publica, eine öffentliche Sache ohne „politischen Charakter“, ohne Staat. Daß aber diese andere Republik schon gegeben sei, wie bei einer unlängst im Wildbad Kreuth stattgefundenen Tagung behauptet, wenn im Hessischen zeitweise die grüne Parlamentsfraktion eine sozialdemokratische Regierung unterstützt oder gar mit der SPD koaliert (das famose rot-grüne Bündnis, bei dem ich mich zuweilen frage, wo denn da das Rote sei), das halte ich für eine Legende, für einen propagandistischen Einfall oder schlicht für das, was Lessing in seiner «Minna» eine Korrektur der fortune nannte: der weiteren Rede nicht wert. Eine wirklich alternative, den bestehenden Verfassungsstaat gefährdende Form kann die Forderung nach Unmittelbarkeit und Autonomie nur unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen gewinnen, die bei den heutigen «neuen» sozialen Bewegungen wenn schon, dann nur am Rande reflektiert werden. Jede organisatorische Form ist immer Form eines spezifischen gesellschaftlichen Inhalts. Sie kann nicht beliebig einem jeden ökonomischsozialen Verhältnis übergestülpt werden. Daher übrigens auch das Scheitern eines jeden Versuchs, die römischen republikanischen Institute etwa in der italienischen Renaissance oder im Verlauf der französischen Revolution wieder zum Leben zu erwecken - also in Gesellschaften, die nicht mehr auf der Grundlage der bäuerlichen einfachen Reproduktion existierten. Kann der Verfassungsstaat des Grundgesetzes zurecht und ohne jeden pejorativen Sinn bürgerlich-kapitalistisch genannt werden, da er die formelle Synthese einer Gesellschaft darstellt, die politisch, kulturell und ideologisch bürgerlich ist und sein will und die kapitalistisch („marktwirtschaftlich“) produziert und verteilt, produzieren und verteilen will, so leuchtet es ein, daß eine ganz anders sein sollende, alternative gesellschaftliche Formation auch einer anders funktionierenden (anders produzierenden und die Reproduktion anders organisierenden) sozialen und ökonomischen Basis, anderer gesellschaftlicher Produktions- und Reproduktionsverhältnisse bedarf. Wer also ernsthaft nach einer anderen Ordnung der öffentlichen Sache (und übrigens der privaten auch) verlangt, muß die Konsequenzen ziehen und die liebliche Vorstellung fallen lassen, die Al-ternative ließe sich nach vorgegebenen, einer anderen Rationalität zugeordneten Regeln verwirklichen. Hic Rhodos, hier haben wir alle zu tanzen - wie Hegel zu sagen pflegte. Gewiß: Solches zu fordern, selbst in der Bescheidung sich mit dem Prinzip einer solchen Hoffnung zu begnügen, klingt heute utopisch, da wir bekanntlich in einer der besten politi-schen Welten leben. Wozu denn Veränderung, wozu - horribile dictu - Revolution, wenn der ökonomischen Krise und der ökologischen Bewegung zum Trotz das politische System hält, Abschwächungen der Legitimation durch offensichtliche (oder auch nur propagierte) Erfolge neutralisiert und um auf den Anfang zurückzukommen - von förmlicher Gesundheit strotzt, ebenso förmlich verkörpert in der, die Stabilität und das Wahre und das Gute ausstrahlenden Gestalt des Kanzlers. Der Begriff also, hier täte Umwälzung gut und das Volk täte recht, die Revolution zu machen, wäre gar kein Begriff, sondern nur abwe- giges Wunschdenken. Guterweise gibt es auch ein Andererseits. Denn andererseits frage ich mich in der Stille meines gesellschaftlichen Hinterkopfes, ob im Wunschdenken doch Begriff und Wirklichkeit sich anmelden; ob in der Welt, in der wir heute leben, ohne geographisch-politische Differenzierungen, die sogenannte Utopie in Wirklichkeit den einzig realen Ausweg zeigt aus der Inhumanität, in der wir uns befinden. Verbleiben wir in der vorfindbaren Welt: Der Einbau demo-kratischerer Elemente in den Staat des Grundgesetzes könnte durchaus das politische Leben bereichern, es interessanter machen und „bürgernah“ gestalten; und am Ende aus der Bundesrepublik einen noch freieren Staat machen, als sie nach kompetentem Urteil schon heute ist. Aber wir werden dadurch bestimmt keine freiere Gesellschaft mit freieren Menschen haben. Anmerkungen 1 Vgl. Vilfredo Pareto, „Economia e demagogia“, in: Giomale economico vom 10.10.1923. ZWANZIG JAHRE DANACH Kommemorativabhandlung zur Transformation der Demokratie „Ich habe das alte Haus inzwischen liebgewon-nen.“ (Eine grüne Abgeordnete über den Bundestag) „Die Institutionen sind mächtiger als die einzelnen Menschen.“ (Marx) Einleitend Zwanzig Jahre sind eine lange Zeit. Der jetzige Zeitpunkt: Die Tendenzwende nach den sozialliberalen - sagen wir Re-formversuchen, bietet sich als überaus günstige Gelegenheit, das Verhältnis der Linken zur Demokratie, zum Verfassungs-staat, zu den Klassen und den Massen neu zu bedenken. Es gilt, all das zu überprüfen, zu korrigieren - oder zu bestätigen - was wir hierzulande gedacht, gemacht, vorgeschlagen und perspektivisch geöffnet haben oder öffnen wollten. Sofern die allgemeine Thematik freilich sich auf das Verhältnis der Linken zur Demokratie bezieht und dabei unter Demokratie die in Westdeutschland herrschenden Zustände meint, scheint sie mir der Änderung bedürftig. Denn sie unterstellt eine in Wahrheit vorhandene Volksherrschaft; sie hält also für wahr, was in jedem Sozialkundebuch steht und im Grundgesetz festgelegt ist: Daß das Wahlvolk zumindest in seiner Vertretung das wirkliche Zentrum, das Subjekt der politischen Macht sei. Die Fragestellung verwandelt sich derart unversehens in die Gretchenfrage der Linken. Die „Demokratie“ als unschuldiges Gretchen fragt uns böse linke Heinriche, wie es denn um unser politisches Glaubensbekenntnis stünde. Die Rationalität des Problems stellt sich aber erst in der Umkehrung her: Was von den de-mokratisch genannten Eigenschaften des bürgerlichen Verfassungsstaats und seiner Institutionen zu halten sei. Wie weiland bei Aristoteles in dem Verhältnis zwischen Koch und Gast: Wir haben das Fragerecht, nicht die konstituierte Ordnung. Darum geht es also nach wie vor. Es geht aber auch - wie es sich gleich zeigen wird - um Persönliches. Ich bitte die sonst streng objektiv-wissenschaftlich eingestellten Leser der Zeitschrift Probleme des Klassenkampfs um Nachsicht, wenn in diesem Beitrag - zumal am Anfang - Persönliches auftaucht. Nicht, daß ich von der berühmten Parole viel hielte: Das Persönliche sei politisch, da ich das Politische eher negativ besetze und auf die Rückgewinnung der gesellschaftlichen und persönlichen Autonomie gegenüber der Form Staat und aller staatlich-politischen Gewaltförmigkeit durchaus Wert lege. Darin sehe ich überhaupt das Geschäft, auf das ich mich schon seit längerer Zeit einlasse, und mit dem die ganze Linke sich befassen sollte: Die Politik theoretisch und so weit wie möglich auch praktisch zu kritisieren. Gerade in diesem Punkt vermischten sich Sache und Person, Projekt und Subjekt, anläßlich einer denkwürdigen Veranstaltung, in der über die Transformation der Demokratie und über meine Positionen verhandelt wurde - in meiner, durch alltägliche Umstände erzwungenen Abwesenheit? Nun soll dies alles eher Gelegenheit sein, einige Begriffe und selbst einige ge-schichtliche Daten zu klären, zum Behufe einer besseren, stichhaltigeren Überprüfung der vor zwanzig Jahren vorgeschlagenen Analysen unserer politischen Zustände.”翻译为中文","output":"这样，我就讨论完了我的主题。联邦共和国据称正走在直接民主制的道路上，但这既不作为一个议题出现，就算形式上实现了，也不是真正的直接民主制。然而，还有一点，一种完全不同的可能性，在主题和纪念之外发展。基础与社会自治、直接性与自由再生产在其政治上，更准确地说，政治批判的翻译中今天可能仍存在许多错误，展开了不稳定和不确定的视角。然而，它们对于宪政国家的组织形式提出了一个全面的替代方案。因此，将它们视为基本法制度的未来威胁是完全正确的 - 这是真正的冲突源和对共识的实质拒绝。从这些，我要强调：是替代的，而不是体制符合的要求（正如一位绿党议员所说：她已经开始真心喜欢“那旧房子”，即指联邦议院）中，可能产生导致不稳定，将不稳定变为策略的过程，以建立一个——如人们常说——不同的共和国。或者最终是一个真正的公共事务，一个没有“政治特性”，没有国家的res publica。 然而，像最近在维尔德巴德克勒特举行的会议上所声称的那样，这个不同的共和国已经存在，当在黑森州时有时绿党议会党团支持一个社会民主党政府，甚至与社民党联合（那著名的红绿联盟，我时常想，红色在哪里），我认为这是一个传说，一个宣传噱头，或者仅仅是，如莱辛在他的《米娜》中所说的，是对命运的一次修正：不值得进一步讨论。 只有在某些条件下，要求直接性和自治才可能获得真正替代现有的宪政国家构成威胁的形式，这些条件在如今的“新”社会运动中如果有的话，那也只是边缘反映了一下。任何组织形式始终是某个特定社会内容的形式。它不能任意套用在任何经济社会关系上。因此，也正是任何试图在意大利文艺复兴或者法国大革命过程中复活罗马共和国机构的努力都失败了——也就是在不再基于农民简单再生产基础上的社会中。 如果说，基本法的宪政国家可以正确且无任何贬义地被称为资产阶级-资本主义的，因为它代表着一个在政治上、文化上和意识形态上是且愿意成为资产阶级的社会，并且在资本主义（“市场经济”）方式下生产和分配，希望生产和分配，那么很明显，一个期望完全不同的，替代性的社会组织形式也需要不同的工作原理（不同的生产和组织再生产方式）的社会和经济基础，需要不同的社会生产和再生产关系。因此，任何认真寻求公共事务（而且是私人事务）不同秩序的人，必须接受这些后果，并放弃美好的想法，即这种替代性可以按照预设的、属于其他理性的规则来实现。“这里是罗得岛，我们所有人都必须在这里跳舞”——正如黑格尔所习惯说的。 当然：提出这样的要求，即便是满足于这种希望的原则，今天听起来很乌托邦，因为我们众所周知生活在最佳的政治世界之一。为什么需要变革，为什么——可怕的说——革命，即使政治制度在经济危机和生态运动的冲击下仍旧维持，通过明显的（或仅仅是宣传的）成功中和合法性的减弱，并且——回到开始——显示出形式上的健康，正式体现在散发着稳定、真实和美好的宰相形象中。所以，这个概念，即变革是好的，人民起来革命是正当的，根本不是个概念，而只是一种不切实际的愿望。幸好还有另一面。因为另一方面，在我社会思想的内心深处，我自问，在愿望中是否确实存在概念和现实；在我们今天生活的世界中，无需地理政治区分，所谓的乌托邦实际上展示了从我们所处的非人道状态中出路的唯一现实途径。 让我们留在可见的世界中：在基本法的国家中加入更多民主元素确实可以丰富政治生活，使其变得更有趣且“亲民”；并最终使联邦共和国比根据专家评价现已如此的状态更自由。但我们绝不会因此拥有一个更自由的社会和更自由的人们。 注释 1 参见Vilfredo Pareto，《经济学与民粹主义》，载于《经济日报》，1923年10月10日。 二十年后 纪念性论文关于民主的转变 “我现在已经开始喜欢那旧房子了。”（一位绿党议员谈论联邦议院） “机构比个人更有力量。”（马克思） 导言 二十年是很长的时间。现在这个时刻：在社会自由主义的——让我们说改革尝试之后的趋势转变，提供了一个极好的机会，重新思考左翼对民主、对宪政国家、对阶级和大众的关系。我们需要复审、修正——或确认——我们在这个国家所思考、所做、所提议的和想要开启或已经开启的视角。只要这一通用主题确实涉及左翼与民主的关系，并且在此将民主解释为在西德所盛行的状态，我认为它需要被修改。因为它假设了实际存在的人民统治；因此，它认为每本社会科学书中所写的和基本法中规定的是真的：即选民至少在其代表中是政治权力的真正中心、主体。这样的问题设定从而变得不知不觉地转化为左翼的核心问题。作为无辜的“格雷琴”（Gretchen）的“民主”恶意地询问我们这些坏蛋“海因里希”（Heinrich），我们的政治信仰是什么。但是，问题的合理性只有在反转中才能建立：对所谓民主的资产阶级宪法国家及其机构的特质持何看法。正如亚里士多德在厨师与宾客之间的关系中所做的那样：我们拥有提问的权利，而不是既定的秩序。所以，这还是围绕着同样的问题。但也——正如我们马上就会看到的——涉及个人。我请求那些通常严格遵循客观科学标准的《阶级斗争问题》杂志的读者谅解，如果本文——特别是开头——出现了个人内容。不是我特别重视那句名言：个人的就是政治的，因为我倾向于将政治赋予负面含义，并且非常重视恢复社会和个人对国家形式及所有国家-政治强制性的自治。我认为这正是我长期以来一直从事的业务，整个左翼都应该处理的事务：理论上和尽可能实践上批判政治。正是在这一点上，事情和人物、项目和主体在一次值得纪念的活动中混合在一起，在那里讨论了民主的转变和我的立场——在我因日常情况被迫缺席的情况下？现在，这一切更多地是为了澄清一些概念甚至一些历史数据的机会，以便更好、更有力地复审二十年前提出的对我们政治状态的分析。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die denkwürdige Veranstaltung Sie fand in einem größeren Rahmen statt, als Teil und Sitzung eines beachtenswerten und beachteten Gedenkkongresses, der ohne erkennbares Jubiläumsdatum, vielmehr zufällig und aus Gründen akademischer Betriebsamkeit zustandekam, vorläufig folgenlos zwar, aber zumindest publizistisch erfolgreich zu sein schien - und an dem des SDS und der Revolteepoche der 60er und 70er Jahre gedacht wurde. Genauer ging es um das Jahr 1968. In der Öffentlichkeit fehlte es ebensowenig an einer Ironisierung der Veteranen, die sich gegenseitig Irrtümer vorwarfen, zugleich aber sich der „Taten erinnerten, welche gescha-hen“ (Hölderlin), wie an dem Hinweis auf die „Nostalgie“ - beides belanglose Anwürfe für diejenigen, die dabei waren und darüber denken wie über die Kanonade von Valmy. Ich vermute ohnehin, daß eines Tages das Jahr 1968 ebenso in die geschichtliche Erinnerung eingehen wird wie das Jahr 1848 - auch Datum eines gescheiterten Schritts zur Emanzipation. „E tutto un quarantotto“ [Es ist wie in der 48er Revolution], sagt man noch heute in Norditalien, um Rebellion, Chaos und Befreiung aus verhaßter Herrschaft zu bezeichnen. Keine Nostalgie, sondern Neudenken eines nach vorne gerichteten Anspruchs. In diesem Zusammenhang konnte es nicht ausbleiben, daß - ebenso folgenlos wie erfolgreich - auch über die Parlamenta-rismus-Diskussion der APO (mir wäre der Ausdruck AIO lie-ber, sprachlich andere Assoziationen hervorrufend und korrekter die außerinstitutionelle Perspektive anzeigend, um die es uns anfänglich ging) Altes, Neues und Originelles mitgeteilt wurde. In freundlicher Erinnerung rückte also die von mir und Peter Brückner gemeinsam vorgelegte Studie über die Transformationen in den Mittelpunkt, die der westliche Staat (stellvertretend: die Bundesrepublik) und das Bewußtsein der in ihm lebenden Individuen nach der Zerschlagung des Faschismus erfahren hatten. Die Gelegenheit wäre günstig, und die intellektuelle Potenz der Kongreßteilnehmer durchaus in der Lage gewesen, Aktualität, Gültigkeit, Brüchigkeit einer nunmehr 20 Jahre zurückliegenden Analyse zu überprüfen, meine - wie sie richtigerweise genannt wurde - „Involutionstheorie“ des Ver-fassungsstaats an den Veränderungen zu messen, die inzwischen eingetreten sind. Um einige Punkte und Fragen zu nennen, die von mir gewiß nicht absichtslos oder zufällig herausgegriffen, sondern in eindeutiger Absicht ausgewählt worden sind: Ist die Verlagerung des Klassenkonflikts auf den horizontalen Verteilungskonflikt gescheitert, gar umgekippt? Ist die institutionelle Strategie des Pluralismus ad absurdum geführt oder ohnmächtig geworden? Ist das Parlament, der grün angereicherte Bundestag doch noch zum Zentrum der politischen Form geworden, verkörpert er inzwischen die Präsenz und verwirklicht er die Verfügungs- und Entscheidungsgewalt des Volkes? Wer hat nun das Richtigere getroffen: Carl Schmitt mit seiner These von der parlamentarisch bedingten Destabilisierung und Parti- kularisierung der Staatsmacht oder meine Mutmaßung, daß ge-rade das parlamentarische System ein Verfahren zur Herbei-führung friedlich-integrativer Reproduktionsformen sei. Man möge mir die grobe Ironie nachsehen: Haben wir 20 Jahre danach „mehr Demokratie“, eine größere Eingriffsmöglichkeit der Bevölkerung in die politischen Entscheidungsprozesse? Was hat sich geändert, daß die ganze Theorie der Transfor-mation der Demokratie als obsolet zu betrachten wäre? Ich räume ein, daß es der Möglichkeiten der Falsifizierung viele gibt. Wir erleben zur Zeit - und nicht nur in der Bundesrepu-blik - eine Tendenzwende. Zumindest hören wir davon. Das könnte bedeuten, daß in der Tat der Involutionsprozeß sich umgekehrt und sich umtransformiert hat in einen Evolutions-prozeß, der uns zu neuen Ufern der Emanzipation führt. Es wäre nachzusehen, inwieweit der westdeutsche Staat, der Verfassungsstaat überhaupt, wenn nicht vor der Selbstauflösung, so doch zumindest vor der Humboldtschen Selbstbeschneidung stünde; und ob die Gesellschaft sich die öffentliche Verfügung über sich selbst zurückholte, die sie vor langer Zeit der Politik und der Form Staat übereignet hatte. Weder Involution, noch die von Wolf-Dieter Narr so sehr gefürchtete „Landnahme“ behielten Aktualität. Vielmehr: „Weniger Staat, mehr Markt“ - es klingt beinah wie die Erfüllung eines anarchischen Blütentraums. Es bedeutet in Wirklichkeit genau das Gegenteil. Offensichtlich hatte sich der sozial genannte Staat, wenn auch nur geringfügig, von seinem Zweck entfernt, Garant der Reproduktion einer kapitalistisch produzierenden Gesellschaft zu sein. Das heißt: Von Entfernung kann gar keine Rede sein. Er hatte in löblicher Weise versucht, wie weiland Giolitti anfangs der 20er Jahre in Italien, die in den 60er Jahren in ganz (West-) Europa aus den Fugen geratene Gesellschaft durch eine Erhöhung der Integrationskosten (Lohnpolitik, Bildungsurlaub, Sti-pendienvergabe, Betriebsverfassungen) wieder fügsam zu machen - ökonomisch unvermeidlicherweise auf Kosten der Akkumulationsrate und der unternehmerischen Verfügungsgewalt - und überdies zu einem Zeitpunkt, als die endemische Krise einsetzte und das Kapital an anderen Formen der Integration sich interessiert zeigte. „Mehr Markt“: Kein Flug ins Autonome also, sondern Rückbesinnung der politischen Klasse (eine Gesinnungsinvolution) auf das eigene Geschäft, für die Identität von bonum comune und Gewinnspanne zuständig zu sein und nicht für die Identifikation des bonum comune mit der salus populi. Es hätte in der Tat genügend aktuelle Fälle gegeben, die In-volutionstheorie, jenseits der im Grunde banalen Thematik der Wahlbeteiligung dissidenter Bewegungen, zu falsifizieren und zu Fall zu bringen. Ich schlage zur Überprüfung eine Einrich-tung vor, die in der Transformation der Demokratie gewiß nur eine Randrolle spielt, ohnehin nicht zum harten Kern des Verfassungsstaats gehört, im Zusammenhang von Herrschaft und Öffentlichkeit aber eine durchaus originelle Funktion ausübt: das Institut des parlamentarischen Untersuchungsausschusses. Der Untersuchungsausschuß des Bundestags, der sich mit allerlei dunklen Geldtransaktionen und mit der Tätigkeit einiger Dunkelmänner befaßte, erlangte in der Öffentlichkeit eine noch nie dagewesene Bedeutung. „Nur Fundamentalopposition ist daran interessiert, politische und gesellschaftliche Mißstände schonungslos aufzudecken.“ (Transformation der Demokratie, im folgenden TdD, siehe S. 89) Aufdeckung fand in der Tat statt, Schonungslosigkeit machte sich breit. Das Volk konnte zufrieden sein und zufriedengestellt werden - das Volk, das ist wir alle, die mit großem Vergnügen und großem Gewinn den Verlauf der Untersuchung in der Presse verfolgten, um dann überrascht festzustellen, daß trotz Schilys tapferen Verhaltens am Ende das Institut doch so funktionierte, wie in der Trans-formation der Demokratie analysiert: „Zentrum einer gesell-schaftlichen Machtfunktion, das sich auch zum Subjekt unmittelbarer Bedürfnisse entwickeln kann, unter Umständen aber eine Fiktion darstellt oder durch einen fiktiven Stellenwert charakterisiert ist... (Es geht um) symbolische Einrichtungen, die über keine effektive Macht verfügen, im Machtsystem jedoch spezifische Aufgaben erfüllen - ohne die also ein Machtsystem brüchig werden könnte.“ Freilich könnte darauf hingewiesen werden, daß ein mutmaßlicher Dunkelmann, obzwar Minister, gehen und sich einem Gerichtsverfahren unterziehen mußte. Nur scheint mir der Weggang eines Ministers, des Verdachts wegen, unbefugterweise silberne Löffel geschenkt erhalten zu haben, zwar erfreuliche Aspekte zu haben. Als Beweis einer fundamentalen Tendenzänderung von der Involution zur Evo-lution, von der Verstaatung der Gesellschaft zur gesellschaftli-chen Autonomie, von der Transmissionsrolle des Parlaments zu einer neuen, emanzipatorischen Aufgabe - kurz: als Falsifi-zierung der Involutionstheorie sind all diese Ereignisse ziemlich dürftig. Darüber hätte ich also gerne mit den alten Genossen und mit der so oft genannten, neuen Studentengeneration diskutiert und gestritten. Wie gesagt: Es ging nicht. Ich wurde sehr häufig direkt ad personam angesprochen, in prima persona zu reden war mir leider nicht vergönnt. Ein betrüblicher Umstand, für-wahr. Indessen: Einigen Diskutanten erschien der Umstand so betrüblich wiederum nicht, vielmehr der Rede- und Gedankenfreiheit durchaus dienlich. Von mir aus fraglos sehr subjektbezogen und, wie erwähnt, persönlich gesehen: Da der Missetäter fehlte, konnte um so freizügiger über seine Positionen hergezogen werden. ”翻译为中文","output":"**这场值得纪念的活动** 这场活动在一个更大的背景下举行，作为一个值得关注的纪念大会的一部分和一次会议。这个大会没有明显的纪念日，而是偶然地，出于学术活动的原因，组织起来的，虽然暂时没有什么后果，但至少在新闻上似乎成功了——回顾了SDS（社会民主学生联盟）和60年代及70年代反叛时代。更具体地说，讨论的焦点是1968年。公众对于那些互相指责错误的老兵们的讽刺，并不缺少，同时他们又回忆着那些“已经发生的行动”（荷尔德林），就像对待瓦尔米炮击战一样。也有人提到了“怀旧”——对于那些参与其中并思考其意义的人来说，这些都是微不足道的指控。我猜测，有一天1968年会像1848年那样被记载进历史记忆中——也是自由化进程失败的一个日期。“E tutto un quarantotto” [就像在48年革命中]，今天在意大利北部仍然用来指代反抗、混乱和从令人厌恶的统治中解放出来。没有怀旧，而是对面向未来的要求进行重新思考。 在这样的背景下，不可避免地针对APO的议会主义讨论——我更喜欢AIO这个表述，因为它带来不同的联想并更准确地指向了我们最初关注的非体制观点——分享了旧观点、新观点和创新观点。因此，我和彼得·布吕克纳共同进行的研究变得令人怀念地成为焦点，该研究探讨了西方国家（代表性的是联邦共和国）及其居民意识在粉碎法西斯主义之后所经历的转变。这次会议是一个很好的机会，会议参与者的智力潜力完全有能力审查直到现在为止的20年的分析的时效性、有效性、脆弱性，对我的所谓“宪法国家逆向发展理论”根据此间发生的变化进行评估。这里提出了一些问题和观点，这些问题和观点绝非偶然或无意选择，而是有着明确意图挑选的：阶级冲突转移到水平分配冲突上是否失败甚至逆转了？多元主义的制度战略是否被证明荒谬或变得无力？联邦议院——绿色党的加入是否让其成为了政治形态的中心，它是否实现了民众的存在和作出决策的权力？谁的预测更准确：卡尔·施密特关于议会引发的国家权力不稳定和细分化的论断，还是我对议会制度将成为和平整合再生产方式途径的设想？请原谅我的粗糙讽刺：20年后我们是否拥有了“更多的民主”，人口对政治决策过程的更大介入权？ 改变了什么，使得整个民主转变的理论被认为是过时的？我承认，存在很多可能的错误之处。我们目前正在经历——不仅仅在联邦共和国——一种趋势转变。至少我们听说了这些。这可能意味着，事实上逆向发展过程已经逆转，并转变为将我们引向新的解放彼岸的进化过程。值得检查的是，西德国家，宪法国家总体是否面临着自我解散，至少是自我限制的处境；社会是否收回了她很久以前赋予政治和国家形式的公共处置权。不再是逆向发展，也不是沃尔夫-迪特·纳尔所极为担忧的“土地兼并”保持着现实性。相反：“少点国家，多点市场”——这几乎听起来像是无政府主义者的梦想成真。实际上，这正好相反。显然，所谓的社会国家，即便只是稍微，也偏离了其作为资本主义生产社会再生产保障者的目的。也就是说：根本无从谈起偏离。它试图以值得称赞的方式，就像20世纪20年代初的意大利的焦利提一样，通过提高整合成本（薪资政策、教育假、奖学金发放、企业宪章），使在60年代整个（西）欧洲动荡不安的社会再次变得驯服——经济上不可避免地以牺牲积累率和企业家控制权为代价——而且是在内在危机开始之际，资本对其他形式的整合表现出兴趣之时。 “更多市场”：因此并不是飞向自主，而是政治阶级（一种观念上的逆向发展）回归其本职工作，即负责维护公共利益与利润之间的一致，而不是将公共利益与人民福祉相认同。 事实上，有足够的当前案例可以证伪逆向发展理论，超越了起初平凡的选举参与异议运动的主题，推翻它。我建议审查一个在民主转变中只扮演着边缘角色的机构，它本身并不属于宪法国家的核心，但在统治与公众领域中担任着相当独特的功能：议会调查委员会。联邦议院的调查委员会处理了一些不透明的金钱交易以及一些阴暗人物的活动，在公众中获得了前所未有的重要性。“只有根本性的反对派对无情揭露政治和社会弊端感兴趣。”（《民主转变》，以下简称TdD，参见第89页）的确进行了揭露，坦率变得普遍。人民可以感到满意并被满足——人民，即我们所有人，我们通过媒体跟踪调查的进展，然后惊讶地发现，尽管希利勇敢的行为，最终该机构的运作与《民主转变》中的分析一致：“一个社会权力功能的中心，它也可以发展成直接需求的主体，但有时却是一个虚构或以虚构地位为特征的主体......（它关乎）象征性的机构，它们没有有效的权力，但在权力系统中履行特定的任务——没有它们，权力系统可能会变得脆弱。”当然，可以指出一位被怀疑的黑暗人物，尽管是一位部长，必须离职并接受法庭审判。只是我认为一位部长因被怀疑不当地收到银勺作为礼物而离职，虽然令人高兴，但作为从逆向发展到进化、从社会国家化到社会自治、从议会的传递角色到新的、解放性任务的根本趋势变化的证据——简而言之，作为证伪逆向发展理论的证据，这些事件似乎相当不足。 因此，我很想与老同志们以及经常提到的新一代学生讨论和争论这些问题。正如我所说：不可能。我频繁地直接被提及，但遗憾的是我无法亲自发言。这是一个令人遗憾的情况，的确如此。然而，对一些讨论者来说，这种情况似乎并不那么令人遗憾，反而对言论自由和思想自由大有裨益。就我个人而言，如前所述，个人视角下：由于缺席者，可以更自由地对其立场进行批评。"},{"instruction":"请将“Wieder bäte ich die Leser gerne um Nachsicht. Wie gesagt, zwanzig Jahre sind eine lange Zeit und Korrekturen sind denkbar, vielleicht notwendig. Damals gab es die Grünen noch nicht, die Alternative verstand sich als klassen- und nicht als umweltbedingt; die Kanzler waren intelligent und redeten keinen Kohl. Verfassungsstaat oder was sonst - so lautete die Parole; und nicht, ob Abgeordnete rotieren sollten oder sich permanent etablieren. Die sachliche Auseinandersetzung über Gültigkeit und Zeitbedingtheit des „Involutionsansatzes“ ging unter in einer eigentümlichen Art von Quellen- und Motivationsforschung. Man gefiel sich sehr in der Suche nach Vorbildern und Absichten der Transformation der Demokratie, nach Vergangenheit und vormaliger Orientierung - wohl der mittel-alterlichen (oder auch linken) scholastischen Methode gemäß, das Kriterium (criterium veritatis - so wurde es genannt) für Sinn, Wert und Richtigkeit einer Theorie nicht in der Sache selbst und in der adaequatio ad rem zu suchen, sondern in der reconductio ad auctoritatem. Woher also die Transformation der Demokratie: Schmitt, Kirchheimer, Pareto, Spirito, Plato; oder aus jugendlichem Erlebnis, Gymnasialzeit, Krieg, Studentenzeit und entsprechenden Theorievorbildern? Erweist sich nun die vermeintliche Quelle als famos oder als dubios; die entdeckte, autoritativ gegründete ursprüngliche Motivation als erkennbar oder bestreitbar, so kann danach auch das Urteil über die diskutierte Theorie ausfallen. Die Beschäftigung mit der Sache selbst erübrigt sich. Zu dieser Art, sich mit Autoren statt mit Problemen zu beschäftigen, gleich eine zwar nicht notwendige, aber doch nützliche Bemerkung. Sie soll den Diskutanten zum Begriff verhelfen, deren Denken offensichtlich und bequem nur in Vorstellungen verharrt (vgl. Hegels Phänomenologie des Geistes, Schlußsatz der Schädellehre).2 Zunächst aber eine geschichtliche Erinnerung, ganz im Sinne einer Gedenkveranstaltung, die auch zur begrifflichen Klärung gehört und Mißverständnisse über die Transformation der Demokratie ausräumen könnte. Zur Vorgeschichte der Transformation Geschichtliche Erinnerungen, die unvermeidlicherweise zuweilen sich mit Lebenserinnerungen vermischen, dienen auch der Richtigstellung mystologischer Neu- oder Spätdeutungen, die mit Daten und Fakten willkürlich verfahren und zum Beispiel aus dem Zusammentreffen von Schrift und Ereignis ein Mysterium besonderer Art machten: die „Bibel der APO“. Dies zurecht zu rücken ist um so interessanter, als Rezensenten, Historiographen und sonstige Autoren offensichtlich mit der zeitlichen Reihenfolge der Weltgeschichte nicht ganz zurecht kommen. Teils aus banalen, zufälligen Gründen: So schrieb das Argument 1970 in einer, übrigens sehr wohlwollenden und lobenden Besprechung, die Transformation der Demokratie sei „ein wichtiges Produkt der Studentenbewegung“, welche bekanntlich vor 1970 begann. Und ein bedeutsamer LeviathanAutor, der den Einfluß Kirchheimers (1967) namentlich auf meinen Teil der schmalen Schrift nicht ohne Erfolg zu beweisen sich bemühte, verlegte zum Behufe der Richtigkeit seiner Beweisführung das Erscheinungsdatum der Transformation der Demokratie um zwei ganze Jahre nach hinten, also auf das Jahr 1969. Es menschelt halt allenthalben, wie die Schwaben zu sagen pflegen. Also komme ich zur Sache, eine Sache, die sich mit einer der aufrichtigsten Persönlichkeiten der deutschen Linken und mit einem der klarsten Kritiker der westdeutschen Mißstände verbindet. Als Brückner und ich den Plan faßten, nach dem Scheitern eines verlegerischen Projektes gemeinsam über Politik, Gegenwart und Staat etwas zu veröffentlichen, stand die später so genannte Studentenbewegung, (also: die Protest- und Revoltebewegung der 60er Jahre) noch nicht auf der Tagesordnung. Man stand eher unter dem Eindruck der glücklicherweise sich als falsch erwiesenen Habermasschen Untersuchung über Student und Politik. Die damals noch junge Bundesrepublik galt als Modell eines friedenspolitischen, stabilen und west-demokratischen Staats: ohne Klassenkämpfe, ohne institutionelle Krisen mit kontinuierlicher Wachstumsrate. Das Schlagwort „Modell Deutschland“ gab es schon in der Adenauerschen Zeit und tauchte - nach meinem Wissen - erstmalig 1960 auf, anläßlich eines von mir gehaltenen, mißglückten Referats an der Universität Florenz. Mißglückt insofern, als ich naiv über die westdeutschen Zustände kritisch zu referieren glaubte, während der einladende Professor, Giuseppe Maranini, der große alte Herr der italienischen politischen Wissenschaft, aus meinen Ausführungen nur Erfreuliches heraushörte und also beschloß: „Dobbiamo prendere la repubblica federale come modello di stato democratico moderno.“ [„Wir müssen die Bundesrepublik als das Modell eines modernen demokratischen Staates ansehen.“] In die Gültigkeit dieses Modells schlug zunächst Peter Brückner ein. Als wir uns erstmalig trafen (bei einer Tagung der Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung), war er mir schon bekannt, ich ihm ein Unbekannter. Meine, wenn man so sagen kann, Urfassung der Transformation, „Demokratie und Neue Obrigkeit“ (eine kurze Analyse der Vermählung von parlamentarischem System und obrigkeitsstaatlicher Politik im sogenannten CDUStaat), blieb unbeachtet oder ungelesen. Brückners Vorschlag aber: „Erziehung zum Ungehorsam“, hatte Signalwirkung für die immer noch verunsicherte Linke. Ich selber erkannte in Brückners Ausführungen die Übersetzung meiner politischen Kritik ins Psychologisch-pädagogische und die Geburtsstunde der späteren antiautoritären Erziehung. Die Anregung, mich näher mit dem politischen System der BRD zu beschäftigen, ging von Ossip K. Flechtheim aus - zunächst zwecks Herstellung einer Habilitationsarbeit. So begab ich mich Ende Februar 1965 zusammen mit Steffani nach Bonn, um vor Ort Informationen, empirisches Material und arcana über Vor- und Hintergründe einer parlamentarisch verfaßten Republik zu sammeln. Ein erstes, synthetisierendes Ergebnis dieser Forschungsarbeit erschien im gleichen Jahr in Lelio Bassos Zeitschrift Problemi del socialismo mit dem Titel: „11 regime Parlamentäre nella repubblica federale“ [Das parlamentarische Regime in der BRD] - sozusagen, und wenn die vergleichende Anmaßung erlaubt ist, mein Rohentwurf der späteren Transformation der Demokratie und zugleich die Enthüllung des Geheimnisses im Titel dieses Beitrags: eben 20 Jahre danach. Noch wichtiger freilich, daß Ende 1965 Peter Brückner sich beim Kölner SDS meinen Vortrag über „Verfassung und Herrschaft“ anhörte - eine weitergehende Fassung des ersten Entwurfs. Brückner hatte kurz zuvor vom Fischer-Verlag den Auftrag erhalten, einen Sammelband über die Bundesrepublik, ihre Politik und ihre gesellschaftlichen Probleme zu besorgen. Seinem Vorschlag folgend schrieb ich für den Sammelband - eben die Transformation der Demokratie - , allerdings mit dem Arbeitstitel „Verfassung und Herrschaft“. Dabei spielte das politische System der Bundesrepublik für mich nur eine exemplarische und exemplifizierende Rolle. Auch Brückner war mehr an einer generalisierbaren Analyse des modernen bürgerlichen Staats und dessen institutioneller Strategie interessiert. Die geschichtliche Funktion des bürgerlichen Staats vorausgesetzt (und nicht erst „abgeleitet“), die Reproduktion einer kapitalistisch produzierenden, bürgerlich bestimmten Gesellschaft zu garantieren, galt es zu untersuchen, wie diese allgemeine Funktion im Einzelnen, in ihren Einrichtungen und durch ihre Organe funktionierte: Wie werden staatliche Institutionen benutzt und transformiert, um als Instrumente der Friedensstiftung in einer kon- fliktual strukturierten Gesellschaft zu dienen, um mögliche Einbrüche unbotmäßiger (akkumulationswidriger) Impulse oder Bewegungen einzudämmen? Instrumente einer gewaltförmigen, aber unblutigen und rechtlich friedlichen Konterrevolution. Das war und ist gewiß nichts Neues: Der Staat eliminiert die Bedingungen eines latenten Bürgerkrieges. Das Neue lag höchstens darin, daß dies offen und offensichtlich überzeugend dargestellt wurde. Der Fischer-Verlag lehnte meinen Beitrag ab - übrigens aus Gründen, die mit den Quellen und Motiven der Berliner Kongreß-Diskutanten nichts zu tun hatten. Die Kritik an den bundesrepublikanischen Zuständen hielt sich damals noch in den Grenzen der Frankfurter Schule und der Marburger Perspektive einer Diskrepanz zwischen Verfassungsnorm und Verfassungswirklichkeit.”翻译为中文","output":"再次请求读者的宽容。如所说，二十年是很长的时间，修正也许是必要的，也是可行的。那时，绿党还不存在，替代被视为阶级而非环境问题；总理富有智慧，不会说废话。宪法国家还是其他什么——这是口号；而不是议员是否应当轮换或永久性地扎根。围绕“逆向发展观点”的有效性和时效性的实质性讨论消失在一种特殊类型的来源和动机研究中。大家非常喜欢寻找《民主的转变》的灵感来源和原始动机，对过去和早期的导向进行探索——可能是遵循中世纪（或左翼）经院派的方法，不是根据事物本身和与事物的对应来寻求理论的意义、价值和正确性的标准（criterium veritatis——这是当时的说法），而是通过reconductio ad auctoritatem（追溯到权威）。那么，《民主的转变》源自哪里：施米特、基希海默、帕累托、斯皮里托、柏拉图；还是来自青少年经历、高中时代、战争、学生时代和相关的理论灵感？现在，如果所谓的来源被认为是值得赞扬或可疑的；如果发现的、权威性的原始动机被认为是可识别的或有争议的，那么对所讨论的理论也可以作出相应的评价。这样，处理作者而非问题本身的做法便免去了对实质问题本身的关注。顺带说一句，虽然这不是必要的，但却是有用的评论，它应该帮助那些思考显然并且方便地只停留在概念上的辩论者（参见黑格尔《精神现象学》，颅骨论的最后一句）。但首先，作为纪念活动的一部分，有必要进行历史回顾，这也属于概念澄清的一部分，可以消除关于《民主的转变》的误解。 **《民主的转变》的前史** 不可避免地，历史回忆有时会与生活回忆混合，这也有助于纠正那些对日期和事实随意处理的神秘化的新解释或晚期解释，比如将文字和事件的相遇制造成一种特殊的神秘现象：“APO的圣经”。纠正这一点尤为有趣，因为评论家、历史学家和其他作者显然对世界历史的时间顺序有些混淆。有时这是出于琐碎、偶然的原因：例如，《论点》杂志在1970年的一篇非常友好和赞扬的评论中写道，《民主的转变》是“学生运动的一个重要产物”，而众所周知，学生运动是在1970年之前开始的。一位重要的《利维坦》作者，他试图成功地证明基希海默（1967年）对我那篇小册子部分的影响，为了使他的证据更有说服力，将《民主的转变》的出版日期推迟了整整两年，即到1969年。人人都有人性弱点，正如斯瓦比亚人所说。 所以，让我来谈谈实际情况，这与德国左翼中最真诚的人物之一以及西德乱象最清晰的批评者有关。 当布吕克纳和我计划在一个出版项目失败后共同发表有关政治、当代和国家的作品时，后来所谓的学生运动（即60年代的抗议和反叛运动）还未成为议题。更多的是受到幸运地被证明是错误的哈贝马斯关于《学生与政治》的研究的印象。当时仍然年轻的联邦共和国被视为和平政策的、稳定的、西方式民主的国家模型：没有阶级斗争、没有制度危机、持续的增长率。\\"模范德国\\"的口号在阿登纳时期就已存在，并且据我所知，最早出现在1960年，当时我在佛罗伦萨大学举行的一次不成功的演讲上提到了它。不成功是因为我天真地认为可以批判性地讲述西德的情况，而邀请我的教授，意大利政治学的重要人物朱塞佩·马拉尼尼，却从我的演讲中只听到了令人愉快的事情，因此得出结论：“我们必须将联邦共和国视为现代民主国家的模型。”首先是彼得·布吕克纳打破了这个模型的有效性。当我们第一次见面（在弗里德里希·艾伯特基金会的一个会议上）时，他对我来说已经是众所周知的，而我对他来说还是个陌生人。我的所谓《民主的转变》的初始版本，《民主与新权威》（对议会制与所谓的基督教民主联盟国家中的议会制和权威政治的结合进行了简短分析），未受到注意或未被阅读。布吕克纳的建议：“对不服从的教育”，对仍不安的左翼产生了信号效应。我在布吕克纳的作品中认出了我政治批判的心理学-教育学翻译，以及后来反权威教育的诞生。 奥西普·K·弗莱希海姆激励我更深入地研究联邦德国的政治体系——起初是为了完成一篇学术论文。因此，我于1965年2月底与斯特法尼一起前往波恩，就地收集信息、实证材料和关于议会共和国背景与底层的秘密。这项研究工作的第一份综合性成果于同年在莱里奥·巴索的杂志《社会主义问题》上发表，标题为：\\"11 regime Parlamentäre nella repubblica federale\\" [联邦共和国中的议会制度]——可以说，如果允许进行比较的话，这是我后来《民主的转变》的草稿，同时也揭示了本文标题中的秘密：即二十年后。更重要的是，在1965年底，彼得·布吕克纳在科隆SDS听了我关于《宪法与统治》的讲座——这是第一个草稿的进一步版本。不久之前，布吕克纳接到了费舍尔出版社的任务，编辑一本关于联邦共和国、其政治和社会问题的合集。遵循他的建议，我为这本合集写了——《民主的转变》——当时的工作标题是《宪法与统治》。对我来说，联邦共和国的政治体制仅仅是一个典型和例证的角色。布吕克纳更感兴趣的是对现代资产阶级国家及其制度战略的可概括分析。假定（而不是首次“推导”）资产阶级国家的历史职能是保证资本主义生产、资产阶级决定的社会的再生产，我们的目标是研究这一总体功能是如何在实践中、通过其机构和机关运作的：国家机构是如何被使用和转变的，以便充当冲突结构化社会中的和平创造工具，以限制不守规矩的（反积累）冲动或运动的可能突破？这些是强制性的、但非血腥且合法和平的反革命工具。这当然不是什么新鲜事：国家消除了潜在内战的条件。新颖之处可能仅在于这一点被开放且令人信服地展示了。费舍尔出版社拒绝了我的稿件——顺便说一句，这与柏林大会辩论者的来源和动机无关。当时，对联邦共和国的批评仍然局限于法兰克福学派和马尔堡的视角，即宪法规范与宪法现实之间的差异。"},{"instruction":"请将“Peter Brückner gab seinen Auftrag zurück und schlug mir einen Einzelgang vor: eine gemeinsame Schrift über die Politik des Verfassungsstaats (Agnoli) und über das politische Bewußtsein, das dieser Politik die Zustim-mung gibt (Brückner). Der Titel meines Beitrags hieß nach wie vor „Verfassung und Herrschaft“. Es ist dem glücklichen Einfall des jungen Berliner Verlegers Neumann zu verdanken, aus dem Titel des ersten Abschnitts meines Textes den Gesamttitel der Schrift gemacht zu haben. Also: Transformation der Demokratie. Die ursprüngliche Fassung traf das Richtigere, hätte vielleicht auch interessierte Fehldeutungen verhindert, aber dem schmalen Bändchen weit weniger Erfolg beschert. Brückners Beitrag über die subjektive Seite des politischen Konsenses fiel bekanntlich anders aus als geplant, als am 2. Juni 1967 ein „jeder rationalen Kontrolle entglittener Polizist“ (Peter Brückner, in: TdD, Frankfurt 1968, S. 91) in Erfüllung seines Amtsauftrags und durch Gebrauch seiner Dienstwaffe Benno Ohnesorg irr-tümlich exekutierte und mit seinem Irrtum die Grenzen der subjektiven Rechte im objektiven Staatsrecht anzeigte. Da kurz darauf aus der Transformation der Demokratie eine linke „Parlamentarismus-Kritik“ und die „Bibel der APO“ wurde, bot sich beim Berliner Gedenkkongreß 1985 die Aktualisierung von selbst an. In der BRD gibt es heute eine Fundamentalopposition mit teilweise außerinstitutionellen, strategischen Vorschlägen, die sich nicht nur etwa anschickt, ins Institutionelle einzukehren, sondern schon längst darin wirkt und sich dabei - Vernünftiges, Massenfreundliches und, obzwar ideologisch widerwillig, sogar Fortschrittliches veröffentlichend (und das ist gewiß nicht geringwertig) - sehr wohl fühlt. In der Transformation der Demokratie steht aber - horribile dictu - Kritisches darüber: daß die Herrschaft sich stabilisiert, „wenn die Opposition ihren fundamentalen Charakter ablegt und sich konstitutionalisiert“; und dabei die „formale Seite - die Einhaltung der Spielregeln - ergänzt ... durch die materiale Verkürzung der gesellschaftlichen Opposition zu einem nur staatlich, nämlich parlamentarisch wirkenden Aktionszentrum“. Und noch schlimmer: „In den westlichen Ländern ist die Parlamentarisierung der Linken zu einer Lebensfrage des Kapitalismus geworden“ (TdD S. 83). Daraus droht nun die Lebensfrage der oppositionellen Linken zu werden. „Wir werden zermalmt zwischen unserer radikalen Absage an das System und der Mitwirkung am Funktionieren des Systems“ - so ein italienischer Radikaler auf dem letzten Kongreß seiner Partei (vgl. Il Tirreno, 3.11.85, 2). Wohlgemerkt, das sind andere Probleme der fundamentalen Opposition als die von den so genannten Fundamentalisten, Antiaufklärern und Bahro-Mystologen aufgeworfenen, die mit ihrem Meister um Gott, den uralten Turm, kreisen und immer noch nicht wissen, was sie sind: „ein Falke, ein Sturm, oder ein großer Gesang“ (Rilke, Stundenbuch, nach Bahros Aussage eine seiner wesentlichen Lektüren und Inspirationen - beato lui! [der Glückliche]). Nein. Auf dem Kongreß mußte vielmehr gegen eine aufklärerische Position Stellung bezogen, vor ihr gewarnt werden. Nützliche metakritische Bemerkung „Agnoli wird sich noch äußern müssen.“ Johannes Wendt in der Frankfurter Rundschau vom 4.7.85, S. 13 Goethe schrieb irgendwo, es ließe sich geschichtlich nichts mehr Neues denken: Alles Vortreffliche und alles Verwerfliche sei schon einmal gedacht worden. Daran ändert weder die Computerisierung der Gesellschaft noch die informatische Gesamtkontrolle des Lebens etwas. Darüber läßt sich - wenn auch in der Ausdrucksweise einer anderen Epoche - bei Campanella schon etwas nachlesen oder auch bei den Saint-Simonisten. Da also kein Mensch mehr ab ovo denken kann, können die Quellen aufgespürt werden, aus denen er seine Gedanken entnimmt; und ohne Motive kommt man auch nicht aus, die zu solchen Gedanken zwingen: förmlich, beinah nach einem „Naturgesetz“ im Vicoschen oder Marxschen Sinn. Was nun: Vico selbst, Kant, oder die jüngeren Sophisten; das Jakobinertum, Rousseau, Marat; oder Pareto, die Anarchie, antikapitalistische Sehnsucht? Auf die Suche begaben sich vornehmlich Jakob Taubes und „Wolfgang Kraushaar aus Frankfurt“. Kraushaar setzte auf Pareto, da ich Pareto sehr oft zitierte und mir seine kritischen Bemerkungen zur (liberalen) Demokratie zueigen machte: Ich schlösse mich also der Parlamentarismus-Kritik des (notorisch faschistenfreundlichen) Pareto an. Diese Deutung war aber ein ziemlich grober Fehler. Pareto, nicht ganz zu Unrecht der intellektuellen Größe wegen der „Marx der Bourgeoise“ genannt, ohnehin ein rechtsgerichteter Altliberaler, war alles andere als ein Gegner des Verfassungsstaats. Vielmehr trat er für eine starke politische Klasse ein: für die Herrschaft der Eliten, im übrigen für eine ungehemmte kapitalistische Wirtschaft und die Beibehaltung des Parlaments (vgl. TdD, siehe S. 67 ff.). Er interessierte sich nur für Führungsgruppen, erhoffte sich von den Führern der 2. Internationale die Verwirklichung seines „starken Staats“ und verlegte seine Hoffnungen am Ende auf die Faschisten und auf Mussolini - ohne mit deren Projekten völlig einverstanden zu sein. Kraushaars Hinweis auf Pareto entbehrt nicht der Komik, denn ich ziehe Pareto, teilweise gewaltsam, herbei, nicht um mich seiner Kritik am bürgerlichen Verfassungsstaat anzuschließen, sondern um zu zeigen, daß der Ver-fassungsstaat eher seinen Vorstellungen entspricht und deshalb zu kritisieren sei. Ich vermute hinter Kraushaars Einfall nicht Verfälschung oder Mangel an Offenheit, sondern schlichte Ignoranz, die allerdings mit der Ignoranz der Zuhörer rechnen konnte. Wer kennt hierzulande schon Pareto. Von seinem Gesamtwerk samt Briefwechsel mit Pantaleone (dem italienischen Nationalökonomen, extremen Liberisten und Verbindungsmann zwischen Pareto und Mussolini), einige tausend Seiten umfassend, sind meines Wissens bisher nur einige hundert dem deutschen Lesepublikum dargeboten worden. Kraushaar konnte sich auf zahlreiche Pareto-Hinweise in der Transformation berufen. Jakob Taubes zog den größeren Zusammenhang vor und setzte auf den von mir eher beiläufig und - im Gegensatz zu Pareto - geringschätzig erwähnten, hierzulande aber bekannteren Carl Schmitt. Taubes Anwurf (als Kritik und Warnung zugleich ausgesprochen) fiel origineller aus als Kraushaars Fehlleistung. Taubes Originalität fand sich allerdings nicht in der von ihm entdeckten, übrigens schon seit 1968 von rechten Politologen behaupteten, parlamentarismuskritischen Wahlverwandschaft zwischen dem von vielen so genannten juristischen Theoretiker des Nationalsozialismus und der Transformation der Demokratie. Dazu brauche ich mich nicht zu äußern, da zu diesem Thema schon Kluges von Klügeren mitgeteilt wurde, die auf die Absurdität der Berührungsthesen rechts-und linksextremer Staatskritik hingewiesen und gerade die Wahlverwandtschaft Schmitt-Agnoli ins Reich des ideologischen Trugs verwiesen haben. Ich bedaure nur, daß Jakob Taubes der Gelehrtenrepublik der Fraenkel, Fetscher und Grebing den Rücken gekehrt und sich den Dunkelmännern angeschlossen hat - zu haben scheint. Anders ist es mit meiner Einschätzung der Schmittschen Theoreme und seiner politischen Bedeutung bestellt. In diesen Punkten weiche ich von den gängigen Vorstellungen ziemlich ab - was übrigens die Schwäche des Taubesschen Anwurfs nur bestätigt. Seine Stellung als „Kronjurist des Dritten Reichs“ mag vielleicht seinen eigenen Ambitionen entsprochen haben - in Wirklichkeit gab es sie nicht. Es kann sein, daß in der akademischen Welt der damaligen Zeit, namentlich bei den ohnehin ideologisch anfäl-ligen Rechtsgelehrten, Schmitt zur Durchsetzung und zur Le-gitimation des Nationalsozialismus beigetragen hat. Den NaziFührern war er aber unbedeutend, wahrscheinlich sogar unbekannt. Ein Vergleich mit Alfredo Rocco (den Ernst Nolte den „Carl Schmitt des italienischen Faschismus“ nennt) ver-deutlicht das Mißverhältnis zwischen wirklicher Bedeutung und nachträglich rekonstruierter Rolle: Rocco war auch ein Rechtstheoretiker, ein Faschist, ein Schriftsteller - ein Schmitt also. Zugleich aber schuf er als Minister die neue faschistische Verfassung, den, wie er sagte, „Modernen Staat“; und seine „co- dici“ stehen in Italien immer noch im Mittelpunkt der Diskussion - zum Beispiel in der Frage der Staatsmaßnahmen gegen subversive Vereinigungen.”翻译为中文","output":"彼得·布吕克纳退回了他的任务，并建议我独自进行：共同撰写一篇关于宪法国家政治（阿格诺利）及给予这种政治认可的政治意识（布吕克纳）的论文。我的贡献标题仍然是“宪法与统治”。我们要感谢年轻的柏林出版商诺伊曼的灵感，他将我文本第一部分的标题用作了整篇论文的总标题。于是产生了：《民主的转变》。原始版本可能更准确，也许还能避免有趣的误解，但它不会给这本薄册子带来那么大的成功。如众所周知，布吕克纳关于政治共识的主观方面的贡献与计划有所不同，当1967年6月2日一位“失去理性控制的警察”（彼得·布吕克纳，在TdD，法兰克福，1968年，第91页）执行他的职务并误用武器致使本诺·奥内索格错误地被杀害，揭示了宪法中主观权利的界限。 此后，《民主的转变》很快成为了左翼的“议会主义批评”和“APO的圣经”，因此在1985年柏林纪念大会上自然而然地进行了更新。如今的德国存在着部分具有超体制、战略性建议的根本性反对派，这些反对派不仅准备进入体制，而且早已在其中发挥作用，并在其中——发布理智、大众友好且尽管出于意识形态上的不情愿也是进步的内容（这当然不是无关紧要的）——感到非常满意。然而，《民主的转变》中却有关于批评的内容——不可思议——指出，当反对派放弃其根本性特征并宪政化时，“统治得以稳固”；并且，“形式方面——遵守游戏规则——通过将社会反对派缩减为仅在国家层面，即议会层面行动的中心来补充”。更糟的是：“在西方国家，左翼的议会化已成为资本主义生存的生命问题”（TdD第83页）。这现在威胁着成为反对派左翼的生存问题。“我们在我们对体制的根本性拒绝和参与体制运作之间被粉碎”——这是意大利一个激进派在他党的最后一次大会上的评论（参见Il Tirreno, 1985年11月3日，第2页）。 请注意，这是根本性反对派面临的问题，与所谓的原教旨主义者、反启蒙者和巴霍的迷信者提出的问题不同，后者围绕着自己的导师绕着上帝、古老的塔旋转，仍然不知道他们是什么：“是一只鹰，一场风暴，还是一首伟大的歌”（里尔克，小时祷书，据巴霍的说法是他的主要阅读和灵感来源之一——幸运的他！）。不。在大会上，更需要对启蒙主义立场采取立场，对它表示警告。 **有益的元批评评论** “阿格诺利将不得不作出回应。” 约翰内斯·温特在《法兰克福汇报》1985年7月4日第13版 歌德在某处写道，历史上不可能再有新思想：所有优秀和可恶的东西都已经被想过了。无论是社会的计算化还是生活的信息全控制都不会改变这一点。这一点可以在坎帕内拉那里找到阅读材料，或者在圣西门主义者那里也可以。因此，没有人能够从零开始思考，可以追溯到他从中汲取思想的源泉；没有动机，也就无法产生这样的思想：几乎就像维柯或马克思意义上的“自然法则”。那么是什么呢：维柯自身、康德，还是年轻的诡辩家；雅各宾主义、卢梭、马拉；或帕累托、无政府主义、反资本主义的渴望？ 主要是雅各·陶博斯和“来自法兰克福的沃尔夫冈·克劳沙尔”开始了这场寻找。克劳沙尔押注在帕累托身上，因为我经常引用帕累托并认同他对（自由主义）民主的批评性评论：因此我加入了（臭名昭著的法西斯友好者）帕累托的议会批评。但这种解释是一个相当严重的错误。帕累托，被称为“资产阶级的马克思”是有其原因的，他是一个右翼自由主义者，绝不是宪法国家的敌人。相反，他主张强大的政治阶层：精英统治，还有无限制的资本主义经济和保持议会（见TdD，第67页及以下）。他只对领导集团感兴趣，希望第二国际的领导人实现他的“强国梦”，最终把他的希望寄托在法西斯分子和墨索里尼身上——尽管他并不完全同意他们的项目。克劳沙尔对帕累托的指引缺乏喜剧性，因为我有些强行引用帕累托，不是为了加入他对资产阶级宪法国家的批评，而是为了说明宪法国家更符合他的观点，因此应该受到批评。我猜克劳沙尔的想法不是歪曲或不诚实，而只是简单的无知，但这种无知可以指望听众的无知。谁在这个国家真正了解帕累托呢？据我所知，他的大量著作及与潘塔莱奥尼（意大利国民经济学家，极端自由主义者，帕累托与墨索里尼之间的联络人）的通信，共有数千页，只有几百页被呈现给德语读者。 克劳沙尔可以借助《民主的转变》中众多的帕累托引用来支持他的观点。雅各·陶博斯选择了更广泛的背景，并押注在我偶尔提及并轻视的、在这里更广为人知的卡尔·施密特身上。陶博斯的指责（同时作为批评和警告）比克劳沙尔的失误更具原创性。然而，陶博斯的原创性并不在于他发现的、从1968年以来由右翼政治学家声称的、议会主义批评的渊源与《民主的转变》之间确实存在的联系。对此我不必发表意见，因为那些已经由更聪明的人做出过明智的发言，他们指出了将右翼和左翼极端国家批评的接触论断归为意识形态谬误的荒谬性。我只遗憾雅各·陶博斯背弃了弗兰克尔、费策尔和格雷宾的学者共和国，看起来好像加入了阴暗人物行列。关于我的对施密特定理和其政治重要性的评估，我与流行观点相去甚远——这也只证实了陶博斯指责的脆弱性。他作为“第三帝国的御用学者”的地位也许符合他自己的野心——实际上根本不存在。可能在当时的学术界，特别是在意识形态上容易受影响的法律学者中，施密特为推进和合法化纳粹主义做出了贡献。但对于纳粹领导人来说，他却微不足道，可能甚至不为人知。与阿尔弗雷多·罗科（恩斯特·诺尔特称其为“意大利法西斯主义的卡尔·施密特”）相比，能够明显看出实际重要性与后来重构的角色之间的不匹配：罗科也是一位法律理论家、法西斯分子、作家——一个施密特。但同时，作为部长，他创建了新的法西斯宪法，“现代国家”；以及他的“法典”在意大利至今仍是讨论的中心——例如在针对颠覆性组织的国家措施问题上。"},{"instruction":"请将“Zu Carl Schmitt aber scheinen mir einige Klärungen nötig zu sein. Die von Jakob Taubes verkündete Nähe der Transforma-tion zu Schmitts Parlamentarismus-Schrift träfe mich in der Tat empfindlich - aber nicht, weil die Schmittsche Arbeit nazistisch wäre oder dem Nazismus geholfen hätte, sondern weil sie in der Methode falsch liegt und im Ergebnis entsprechend irrtümlich ausfällt. Schmitt konnte als romantisch-idealistischer Rechtstheoretiker ohne gesellschaftskritische Kategorien - sehr im Gegensatz zu Pareto - das parlamentarische System, seine Funktion und seine Lebenskraft gar nicht begreifen. Er blieb in seinen Vorstellungen den Besonderheiten der Weimarer Republik verhaftet. Daher halte ich diese immer wieder erwähnte Arbeit von Schmitt nicht für das Wichtigste, was wir ihm zu „verdanken“ haben. Das gleiche gilt aber auch für das Freund-Feind-Schema, das sonst allerorten als der Kerngedanke des Schmittschen Begriffs des Politischen gilt und als Zentrum sei-nes Denkens und seiner faschistischen Orientierung sozusagen gefeiert wird. Die Aufteilung der Welt, der äußeren wie der inneren, in Freund und Feind findet sich schon im Alten Testament, wiederholt sich im Neuen und wird später von Augustin zur philosophischen Würde erhoben. Das hat also mit Faschismus nichts zu tun - noch brauchte Schmitt sich dabei an einer Art Säkularisierung, will sagen Verbürgerlichung des Marxschen Klassenkampfs zu orientieren. Er brachte zum Ausdruck, was Politik sei. Freund-Feind-Manichäismen sind zum Beispiel heutzutage aus dem Munde Reagans zu hören - der sich bekanntlich an der Bibel, und gewiß nicht an Schmitt orientiert. Selbst dort, wo Schmitt nazistisch argumentiert, genauer gesagt den Anforderungen der Naziherrschaft sich anpaßt und dadurch zum Nazisten wird, spielt das berühmte Schema nur eine zweitrangige Rolle: Daß „der Führer der Herr des Rechtes“ sei, findet seine Begründung nicht in der Fähigkeit, Freund und Feind zu unterscheiden, vielmehr in der geschichtlichen Legitimität und in der politischen Notwendigkeit einer durchgängig autonomen Entscheidungsgewalt der Exekutive: im „Dezisionismus“. Und wer meine, in der Transformation der Demokratie bis zum Überdruß analysierte und kritisierte und verdammende Auffassung von der Entschei-dungsbefugnis der Exekutive kennt, dem brauche ich nicht mitzuteilen, was ich von Taubes Argumenten halte. Der Mitteilung wert ist aber doch, warum ich Taubes Anwurf für originell halte: Er fand eine Wendung, die aller akademischen Gepflogenheit zum Trotz tatsächlich zu innovatorischen Maßstäben führte, zu einem unerwarteten, gastrologischen Schluß: „Agnoli hat Carl Schmitt mit Löffeln gegessen“. Damit waren also zwei Quellen ausgemacht: Pareto und Schmitt, rechts- oder altliberal der eine, rechtskonservativ der andere - beide allemal mit der rechtesten Form des historischen Faschismus verbunden. „Rot gleich braun“ in vergröberter Form meldete sich wieder an. Im Verlauf der Diskussion aber, und im Übergang von der Quellen- zur Motivforschung, vollzog Wolfgang Kraushaar nicht ohne Eleganz einen salto, ich will nicht sagen mortale, aber immerhin mortificante und landete beim Linksfaschismus. Hatte der Gastrologe meine vermeintliche Quelle in eine Suppe verwandelt (denn mit Löffeln kann man bekanntlich nur eine Suppe essen), so verwandelt der Motivforscher meine „Parlamentarismus-Kritik“ in die Folge jugendlicher Irrungen und Wirrungen. Irgendwann muß Kraushaar gehört oder gelesen haben, daß ich im hohen Alter von 17 Jahren Linksfaschist gewesen oder - wie Krippendorff freundlicherweise in der 7L4Z schrieb - ein „revolutionärer Faschist“. Ich wüßte nicht, warum ich dies leugnen sollte - auch wenn die Verbindung zur Transformation der Demokratie mir sehr geheimnisvoll bleibt. Es geht hier ohnehin nicht um meine Analyse des Verfassungsstaats, sondern um eine - in dieser Form direkt angesprochene - persönliche Kontinuität, die mich selber verblüfft und verunsichert, die mich also vor gewisse Probleme stellt, ohne daß ich mich deren zu grämen bräuchte. „Der gegenwärtige Krieg ist der Krieg zwischen dem Prinzip Arbeit und dem Prinzip Kapital“, und weiter: „Nach dem Krieg wird es unsere Aufgabe sein, die von den Bolschewiki mit der Neuen Ökonomischen Politik verratene Oktoberrevolution fortzuführen“(Originalton - wie man heute zu sagen pflegt - Agnoli 1942 und 1943). Linksfaschismus? Aber ganz gewiß, denn er verstand sich als solcher und wurde im übrigen nur zu Propagandazwecken geduldet. Daher durfte der erste linksfaschistische Satz erscheinen (in der Gymnasialzeitschrift II Tiziano), weil er sich mühelos in den faschistischen Versuch einfügte, die damals schon rebellisch werdende italienische Arbeiterklasse ideologisch bei der Stange zu halten und zu betrügen (eine Klasse allerdings, die bestimmt den Tiziano nicht las). Der zweite Satz, die Fortführung der Oktoberrevolution betreffend, fiel hingegen der Zensur zum Opfer. Wie ein Jahrzehnt früher gegen den größeren Ugo Spi- rito wurde mir amtlicherweise bescheinigt, ich stelle mich „außerhalb des Faschismus“. Der Schulleiter Pellegrini, aktiver Katholik und militanter Faschist zugleich, bezichtigte mich öffentlich des „Marxismus“. Was mich damals, der Leser möge staunen, erheblich belastete und beleidigte. Nun entdeckte Kraushaar in meiner Transformation der Demokratie eine „linksfaschistische Parlamentarismus-Kritik“, ohne Näheres über Form und Inhalt einer solchen etwas sagen zu können. Wie könnte er’s auch. Eine solche Kritik hat der Linksfaschismus nirgends hervorgebracht, veröffentlicht, überhaupt zur Kenntnis genommen. Bei seiner deutschen Art (in der ihm eigenen Sprache ausgedrückt), etwa bei Gregor Strasser und den Seinen, ging es nie über die rechtskonservativ-rechtsextremistische Ablehnung der Weimarer Republik als „marxistischer Staat“ hinaus - höchstens zur Banalität der „Quasselbude“ hinüber. Dort wo Linksfaschismus zu Hause war und sich auch so nannte: In dem Kreis um die Korporativisten Spi- rito, Fontanelli, Rigola gab es andere Probleme und andere Sorgen. Der liberale Staat wurde kritisiert, hegelianisch als mißglückte Verbindung von Individuum und Gemeinschaft, nicht aber in der spezifischen Form des repräsentativen Systems, das vielmehr „modernisiert“ werden sollte: „Camera delle corpo- razioni“ anstelle der „Camera dei deputati“ und „Consigli di competenza“ [Ständekammer; Abgeordnetenhaus; Sachverständigenräte] als Organe der Gesetzgebungsvorschläge - beides stark dem Wirtschaftsrat der Weimarer Verfassung nachempfunden.3 Die Thematik des Linksfaschismus lag auf der Ebene des Verhältnisses von Ökonomie und Politik, befaßte sich mit der staatlichen Reorganisation der Gesellschaft, mit Produktionsweise und Eigentumsverhältnissen („corporazione pro- prietaria“ als dritter Weg zwischen Kapitalismus und Kommunismus). Für den Linksfaschismus existierte das parlamentarische System als Problem oder als Gegenstand einer Kritik gar nicht. Emblematisch gesprochen: „Westliche Demokratie“, ohnehin eher westliche Plutokratie genannt, bedeutete Wall Street und nicht Westminster; „Moskau“ bedeutete Staatskapitalismus und nicht die Verließe des Kremls. Und doch hat Kraushaar aus Frankfurt so unrecht nicht. Nur ist er einer Metalepsis zum Opfer gefallen. Was er „linksfaschistische Parlamentarismus-Kritik“ nennt, meint etwas ganz anderes, geschichtlich Verbürgtes, das ohne Zweifel Eingang in den italienischen Faschismus fand (und zum Teil bewußt suchte): die bekannte „Entrismustaktik“, gegen deren Positionen und Perspektiven sich schon Lenin mit seiner verunglückten Antiradikalismus-Schrift wandte. Linkskommunismus, Anarchosyndikalismus, vor allem aber revolutionärer Syndikalismus: das sind die Quellen der linken Parlamentarismus-Kritik; in ihren Vorschlägen, Hoffnungen und (meinetwegen!) Utopien, Irrungen und Wirrungen finden sich Motive wieder, die in der Transformation der Demokratie auftauchen. Was soll nun das ganze Gemisch aus Pareto, Schmitt und Linksfaschismus? Auf der einen Seite befürchte ich sehr, das Ganze sei veranstaltet worden zu dem legitimatorischen Zweck, das theoretische Umdenken ehemaliger Linker nicht als Ergebnis eines Umfalls, sondern eines reifen Nachdenkens erscheinen zu lassen. ”翻译为中文","output":"关于卡尔·施密特，我认为有必要进行一些澄清。如果雅各·陶博斯宣称《民主的转变》与施密特的议会主义论文密切相关，那确实会使我感到不安——但不是因为施密特的工作是纳粹主义的或对纳粹主义有帮助，而是因为它在方法上是错误的，结果也相应地出现了错误。作为一个缺乏社会批判类别的浪漫主义-理想主义法律理论家——与帕累托截然相反——施密特根本无法理解议会制、其功能和生命力。他的想法仍旧停留在魏玛共和国的特殊性上。因此，我认为施密特这部经常被提及的作品并不是我们应该“感激”的最重要的东西。对于施密特的朋友-敌人模式，这同样适用，这在其他地方被视为施密特政治概念核心思想，并被视为庆祝他的思想和法西斯主义定位的中心。将世界，无论是外部还是内部，划分为朋友和敌人早在旧约中就有记载，新约中也有重复，后来被奥古斯丁提升到哲学的尊严。这与法西斯主义无关——施密特也无需借此来定位于马克思的阶级斗争的一种世俗化，或者说资产阶级化。他表达了政治的本质。例如，今天从里根口中听到的朋友-敌人摩尼教式二元对立——他显然是以圣经为指导，而不是施密特。即使是在施密特的纳粹主义论证中，也就是说，当他适应纳粹统治的要求从而成为纳粹分子时，这个著名的模式只扮演了次要角色：“领袖是法律的主人”的说法不是因为能够区分朋友和敌人的能力，而是因为历史的合法性和政治的必要性，即执行部门全面自主的决策权：在“决策主义”中。熟悉我在《民主的转变》中反复分析、批评并谴责的关于执行部门决策权的观点的人，无需我告诉他们我对陶博斯论点的看法。但值得一提的是，我为什么认为陶博斯的指控很有创意：他找到了一种转折，尽管违反了学术惯例，却真正引领到了创新的标准，得出了一个意想不到的、美食学的结论：“阿格诺利用勺子吃掉了卡尔·施密特”。 因此，我们找到了两个源头：帕累托和施密特，一个右派或旧自由主义者，另一个右翼保守主义者——两者都与历史上最极右的法西斯主义形式相关。在粗略的形式中，“红色等于棕色”再次出现。然而，在讨论过程中，以及从源头研究转向动机研究时，沃尔夫冈·克劳沙尔不失优雅地完成了一个跳跃，我不会说这是致命的，但至少是致死性的，并着陆在了左翼法西斯主义上。如果美食学家将我的假定来源变成了一锅汤（因为众所周知，只能用勺子吃汤），那么动机研究者将我的“议会主义批评”变成了青少年时期的迷茫和困惑。 克劳沙尔不知何时听说或读到，我在17岁高龄时是左翼法西斯主义者，或者——如克里彭多夫在《时间周刊》上更友善地写道——是一个“革命性的法西斯主义者”。我不知道为什么我会否认这一点——即使这与《民主的转变》的联系对我来说非常神秘。无论如何，这里并不是关于我对宪法国家的分析，而是关于一种直接涉及到的个人连续性，这使我感到惊讶和不安，给我带来了一些问题，而我无需为此感到烦恼。“当前的战争是劳动原则与资本原则之间的战争”，以及：“战后我们的任务将是继续被布尔什维克通过新经济政策背叛的十月革命”（原声——如今所说——阿格诺利1942年和1943年）。左翼法西斯主义？当然，因为它就是这样理解的，并且只是出于宣传目的而被容忍。因此，第一个左翼法西斯主义的句子被刊登（在高中杂志《第提希安》上），因为它毫不费力地融入了法西斯主义试图在当时已经变得叛逆的意大利工人阶级中进行意识形态控制和欺骗的尝试中（尽管这个阶级肯定不会阅读《第提希安》）。关于继续十月革命的第二个句子，则被审查所禁止。就像十年前针对更伟大的乌戈·斯皮里托一样，我被官方证明“站在了法西斯主义之外”。学校校长佩莱格里尼，一个积极的天主教徒和坚定的法西斯主义者，公开指责我是“马克思主义者”。这在当时，读者可能会惊讶，给我带来了相当大的负担和侮辱。 现在，克劳沙尔在我的《民主的转变》中发现了一种“左翼法西斯主义的议会主义批评”，却未能具体说明这种批评的形式和内容。他怎么能做到呢。左翼法西斯主义从未产生、出版或注意到这样的批评。在它的德国形式中，如格雷戈尔·施特拉塞和他的同僚，从未超出对魏玛共和国作为“马克思主义国家”的保守主义-极右翼批评——顶多到“闲聊小屋”的陈词滥调。在左翼法西斯主义的发源地及其命名之处，围绕着斯皮里托、丰塔内利、里戈拉等公司主义者，存在着其他问题和关切。自由州被批评为个体与社群未能结合的失败，而不是以代议制的特殊形式批评，这种形式反而应该被“现代化”：“工会议会”取代“议员议会”和“能力委员会”作为立法提案的机构——两者都与魏玛宪法中的经济委员会有很大相似之处。左翼法西斯主义的主题在于经济与政治的关系，涉及到社会的国家重组、生产方式和所有权关系（“所有权公司”作为资本主义与共产主义之间的第三种方式）。对左翼法西斯主义来说，议会制度根本不存在作为一个问题或批评的对象。用象征性的话来说：“西方民主”，更多地被称为西方寡头政治，指的是华尔街而不是威斯敏斯特；“莫斯科”指的是国家资本主义而不是克里姆林宫的地牢。 然而，克劳沙尔并没有完全错误。只是他成了换喻的受害者。他所谓的“左翼法西斯主义议会主义批评”实际上指的是另一种历史上证实的东西，这无疑找到了它在意大利法西斯主义中的一席之地（部分是有意寻找的）：著名的“渗透策略”，列宁在他失败的反激进主义著作中反对这些立场和观点。左翼共产主义、无政府工团主义、尤其是革命工团主义：这些是左翼议会主义批评的来源；在它们的提案、希望和（如果您愿意的话！）乌托邦、迷惘和困惑中，可以找到出现在《民主的转变》中的动机。那么，所有这些关于帕累托、施密特和左翼法西斯主义的混合是什么意思呢？一方面，我非常担心，这一切是为了合理化前左翼人士理论上的反思不是作为摇摆不定的结果，而是作为成熟思考的结果而组织的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Auf der anderen Seite aber darf man nicht vergessen, daß alles Tun auch eine redliche Seele hat! Ich vermute also eben so sehr, daß die Anwürfe, Warnungen und Zweckverbindungen der Gastro- und sonstigen -logen aus brennender Sorge stammten und sich um den edlen Zweck bemühten, die im Auditorium maximum der FU versammelten Generationen und die breite Öffentlichkeit vor den Gefahren eines gleichwie gearteten autonomen Denkens, einer emanzipatorisch zu weit gehenden Kritik der Politik und des Verfassungsstaats zu warnen. Meine Verlegenheit aber bleibt. Pareto, Schmitt, revolutionärer Syndikalismus, Spirito und Hegel und Leibholz und Abendroth, von Vico und Marx ganz zu schweigen: Hier reicht die Suppe als Emblem der Sache nicht mehr aus. Die italienischen Küche muß herhalten. Die Transformation der Demokratie scheint eine echte minestrone zu sein: chi piü ne ha, piü ne metta [Wer mehr (Gemüse, Zutaten etc.) davon hat, wirft mehr in den Kessel.]. Vielleicht liegt darin der Grund, warum sie immer noch schmeckt - zwanzig Jahre danach. Womit ich, Wendts Aufforderung sorgfältig Folge leistend, mich zu der an mir geübten Kritik hinlänglich geäußert hätte. Verfassung, Herrschaft und Faszination Es wäre nicht nur töricht, es käme einer Selbstverleugnung gleich, zu behaupten, es hätte sich in den letzten zwanzig Jahren nichts geändert. Lassen wir vorläufig das Sein beiseite. Im Bewußtsein der Leute sieht vieles anders aus als vor zwei Jahrzehnten. Der Protest hat sich gewissermaßen verallgemeinert: Einspruch gegen politische Entscheidungen anzumelden, Verwahrung gegen Maßnahmen einzulegen, nimmt zuweilen sogar modische, dennoch erfreuliche Formen an. Nicht, daß dies alles immer und überall auch politisch Bedeutsames erreichen würde. Es ist aber immer von Bedeutung, sich nicht alles gefallen zu lassen. Und wir, die Linke insgesamt: Die extreme, die radikale, die parteikommunistische und die antiparteikommunistische, selbst die reformerische Linke und ganz am Rande auch die Linksliberalen (und in einem geringen, ihr aber zustehenden Teil die Transformation der Demokratie) haben viel in Bewegung gebracht, emanzipatorische Kräfte wachgerufen, überhaupt eine Kraft entfaltet, die in den fünfziger Jahren undenkbar gewesen und bestenfalls in den Bereich des Prinzips Hoffnung verlegt worden wäre. Obzwar der Durchbruch nicht gelang, wurde so viel geändert, daß seit einiger Zeit in der westlichen Gesellschaft allenthalben versucht wird, das brüchig gemachte Haus zu reparieren, vom Einsturz bedrohte Wertsysteme zu befestigen oder gar eingestürzte wieder aufzurichten, „Erkenntnisparadigmen“ zu wechseln - mit einem Wort, und beinahe wie zu Metternichs Zeiten: zu restaurieren. Und anscheinend mit Erfolg. Dies will heißen: Die europäische Gesellschaft ist 1985 anders als 1965. Doch liegt die Macht nirgends auf der Straße. In der BRD liegt sie - die politische Macht, versteht sich; nicht die Herrschaft - formell in den Händen eines notorisch genialen Kanzlers; in Großbritannien bei einer eisernen Frau. Mitterand zeigt, was Sozialismus ohne Revolution und also innerhalb der Grenzen des bürgerlichen Staats bedeutet; und Craxi wird nicht nur in Bar-Gesprächen (Bar im italienischen Verstände des Wortes) längst Benito, statt Bettino genannt: nur an der Macht interessiert. Banal wäre es beinahe, hinzuzufügen, daß der Sozialstaat im gleichen Schritt abgebaut wird, wie der Machtstaat sich weiter ausbreitet. Die Frage, die wir uns zu stellen haben, lautet daher und angesichts der tatsächlich eingetretenen Erschütterungen der 60er und der 70er Jahre nicht triumphalistisch, was die Linke denn alles erreicht habe; vielmehr umgekehrt: Warum konnte und kann überhaupt restauriert werden. Anders gesagt: Was hat sich in der allgemeinen Verschiebung (im Sein und Bewußtsein) dieser zwanzig Jahre gar nicht verschoben, nicht verschieben lassen; was hat sich nicht verändert. Und zwar derart, daß aus der Revolte das Gegenteil dessen entstehen konnte, was sie sich erhofft hatte: eine autonome, befreite Gesellschaft, Sturz der Herrschaft, als Mindestprogramm der Abbau (nicht der staatlichen Sozialzuwendungen, sondern) der staatlichen Macht. Demgegenüber zogen die Konservativen mit ihrer Strategie Vorteile aus dem Drang zur Verschiebung - dank ihrer klugen Politik, soviel Äußerungen zuzulassen oder einzuführen, daß alles bei den alten Zuständen blieb, bzw. soviel zu verändern, daß eine günstige Ausgangslage für die Wiederherstellung und die Reproduzierbarkeit des bewährten „Ord-nungsgefüges“ gewonnen wurde. Ich will keineswegs behaupten, daß alle Kinder der Revolte in der Restauration baden gegangen wären. Auch Metternich gelang die totale Rückgängigmachung nicht. Abtreibung auf Krankenschein oder nicht; aber eine Rückkehr zur alten strafrechtlichen Verfolgung streben kluge konservative Politiker nicht an, auch wenn sie es für richtig hielten. Für die Frauen, die davon betroffen sind, ein wichtiger Fortschritt, der zugleich anzeigt, in welcher Richtung es hätte weiter gehen können. Aber etwas Wesentliches? Abgesehen von Moralaposteln und päpstlichen Äußerungen und politischen Pflichtübungen (wg. der nächsten Wahlen): Was kümmert es das Herrschaftssystem, in dem wir leben, ob weniger Kinder gezeugt werden? Was im Zeichen des allgemeinen Rückgangs des variablen Kapitals und der Möglichkeit, durch massenhaften Raketeneinsatz auf den Einsatz massenhafter Heereshaufen zu verzichten? Intakt geblieben sind: Die Produktionsweise, oder will jemand behaupten, der Kapitalismus sei inzwischen durch eine postindustrielle, friedliche Revolution in aller Stille abgeschafft worden; die gesellschaftliche Struktur, für die Kenner oder Kennerinnen der alten Melodie: die gesellschaftlichen Produktions- und Reproduktionsverhält-nisse, oder haben wir keine Klassen mehr, bloß weil das Be-wußtsein davon abgebaut wurde; kein Oben und Unten; keinen Menschen mehr, der vom Verkauf der eigenen Arbeitskraft leben muß; keine Ungleichheit in der Befriedigung der Bedürfnisse; oder haben wir inzwischen „paritätische“ Verhältnisse der Geschlechter?; und schließlich die politische Form. Es sind also genau die drei Grundelemente geblieben, die die Gründe der kritischen Analyse der Transformation der Demokratie lieferten. Mittlerweile kam allerdings ein weiteres Element hinzu, das sich auch zunächst als Grundelement verstand und ankündigte - eine Art Spätfolge, zum Teil uneingestandene Fortsetzung der 68er Revolte; oder, anders betrachtet und wenn man die Berliner Hausbesetzer-Bewegung dazu rechnet, die deutsche Fassung der italienischen „77er Bewegung“, wenn auch konsistenter und erfolgreicher. So erfolgreich, daß nunmehr eine erstaunliche Gegenströmung einsetzte. Hatte 1968/69 die deutsche Linke sich an Italien orientiert, theoretisch wie praktisch, so fing die italienische radikale Linke an, von deutschen Zuständen zu reden als der Verwirklichung möglicher Emanzipation. Die Grünen, die Bunten, die Alternativen traten auf den Plan: Systemveränderer, Element des Bruchs, der radikalen Äußerung und der durchgängigen Kampfansage gegen alle Herrschaft, Ausbeutung, Zerstörung der Menschen und der Natur - auch gegen die politische Form und die durch sie zementierten, zubetonierten Zustände. Und dann begaben sie sich - in seltsamer Wiederholung der Engelsschen Euphorie über die Wahlerfolge der Sozialdemokraten - genau in die Verfassung der Zustände, die sie abschaffen wollten. Dieses Ereignis und seine Folgen verifiziert, allen Vorwürfen und Ungültigkeitserklärungen zum Trotz, die Involutionstheorie. Ein Umfallen war es nicht, sondern das Ergebnis langer Diskussionen (die heute noch andauern) und strategischer Beschlüsse. Gründe dafür gab es und gibt es genug - teils einsehbare, teils vernünftige, meist kurzgedachte. Ich will nicht politisch-psychologische Erklärungsversuche für das Scheitern des derzeitigen Anlaufs zur Fundamentalopposition unternehmen. Dafür bin ich nicht zuständig. Uns fehlt hier Peter Brückner sehr - bekanntlich ein Opfer der genannten Zustände. Das Scheitern kann aber objektiv festgestellt werden. Es ist also dienlich, von der Objektseite auszugehen und auszumachen, welche Vorzüge der Verfassungsstaat bietet und worin seine Faszination für Gruppen besteht, die anfänglich gegen ihn antraten - gegen seine Anmaßung, Staat des Volks und Demokratie zu sein.”翻译为中文","output":"在另一方面，我们也不能忘记，所有的行为都有其真诚的一面！因此，我同样怀疑，那些来自美食学家和其他学者的攻击、警告和目的性联系，是出于迫切的担忧，并试图以崇高的目的，警告FU大礼堂聚集的各代人和广大公众，防范任何形式的自主思考、过于激进的政治和宪法国家批判所带来的风险。但我的尴尬仍然存在。帕累托、施密特、革命工团主义、斯皮里托、黑格尔、莱布霍尔茨和阿本德罗思，更不用说维柯和马克思：这里，汤作为事物的象征已经不够用了。需要借助意大利厨艺。《民主的转变》似乎是一道真正的意大利杂烩汤：chi più ne ha, più ne metta [谁有更多（蔬菜、配料等），就往锅里加更多]。也许这就是为什么它二十年后仍然让人回味无穷的原因。 至此，我已经充分按照温特的要求，对针对我的批评发表了我的意见。 **宪法、统治与魅力** 声称过去二十年间没有发生任何变化不仅愚蠢，而且等同于自我否定。暂且不论存在本身，在人们的意识中许多东西看起来与二十年前大不相同。抗议在某种程度上已经普及：对政治决策提出异议，对措施提出反对，有时甚至采取时髦但仍然令人欣慰的形式。这并不意味着这一切总是在政治上具有意义。但不对一切听之任之总是重要的。我们，左翼整体：极端的、激进的、党派共产主义和非党派共产主义派别，甚至改革派左翼，以及边缘的左翼自由主义者（《民主的转变》在很小的、但属于它的一部分中）已经促成了许多变革，唤醒了解放力量，总之发挥了一种在五十年代无法想象、最好放在希望原则领域的力量。尽管没有实现突破，但已经发生了如此多的变化，以至于在西方社会，到处都在试图修补已变脆弱的家园，巩固或甚至重建已垮掉的价值体系，更换“认识范式”——总之，几乎如同梅特涅时代一样：进行恢复。而且似乎很成功。这意味着：1985年的欧洲社会与1965年不同。但是，权力——当然，是政治权力；不是统治——从未在大街上出现过。在德国，它形式上掌握在一个众所周知的天才总理手中；在英国，掌握在一位铁娘子手中。密特朗展示了没有革命、因此在资产阶级国家界限内意味着什么；克拉克西在酒吧谈话中（意大利对“酒吧”的理解）早已被称为贝尼托，而不是贝蒂诺：只关注权力。几乎是陈词滥调，补充说社会国家正如权力国家不断扩张一样在减少。 因此，鉴于六十年代和七十年代确实发生的动荡，我们要问的问题并不是左翼到底实现了什么；而是相反：为什么能够并且仍然可以恢复。换句话说：在这二十年的总体转变（在存在和意识中）中，什么根本没有改变、无法改变；什么没有变化。以至于从叛乱中产生了它所希望的完全相反的东西：一个自主的、解放的社会，推翻统治，至少是减少（不是国家的社会福利，而是）国家权力。与此相反，保守派凭借他们的策略从变革冲动中获益——感谢他们的明智政策，允许或引入了这么多表达，以至于一切保持原状，或者变化了足够多，以获得修复和再现验证过的“秩序框架”的有利基础。我绝不是说，所有叛乱的孩子都陷入了恢复。连梅特涅也没有完全成功。是否还在医保下堕胎；但聪明的保守派政客不会寻求回到旧的刑事追诉，即使他们认为这是正确的。对于受影响的女性来说，这是一个重要的进步，同时也表明了可以继续朝哪个方向发展。但这是重要的吗？除了道德使徒和教皇的言论以及政治应付（因为下一次选举）：在我们生活的统治系统中，孩子们是否减少了有什么关系呢？在可变资本普遍减少和可以依靠大规模火箭使用来替代大规模军队使用的可能性下呢？保持不变的是：生产方式，或者有人会说，资本主义是否在不知不觉中通过一场和平的、后工业革命被废除了；社会结构，对于那些熟悉或熟知旧旋律的人来说：社会生产和再生产关系，或者我们没有阶级了，只是因为对它们的意识被削弱了；没有上层和下层；没有人需要靠出售自己的劳动力生活；没有满足需求的不平等；或者我们是否已经拥有了“平等”的性别关系？；最后是政治形式。因此，正是三个基本元素保持不变，这些元素提供了对《民主的转变》批判性分析的理由。 同时，另一个元素出现了，最初被视为并宣称为基本元素——一种后来的效应，部分是68年叛乱未承认的延续；或者，如果考虑到柏林的占领者运动，从另一个角度看，是意大利“77年运动”的德国版本，尽管更为稳定和成功。如此成功，以至于现在出现了一个惊人的逆流。如果1968/69年德国左翼在理论和实践上以意大利为榜样，那么现在意大利激进左翼开始将德国状况视为可能解放的实现。绿党、五颜六色的派系、替代派出现了：体制变革者，断裂元素，彻底表达和全面对抗所有统治、剥削、人和自然的破坏者——也对抗政治形式和由其巩固的状态。然后，他们就像恩格斯对社会民主党选举成功的欣喜若狂一样，确切地进入了他们想要废除的状态。这一事件及其后果，尽管有所有的指责和失效声明，却验证了逆向发展理论。这不是倒退，而是经过长时间的讨论（今天仍在继续）和战略决策的结果。有足够的理由——部分是可见的，部分是合理的，大多是短视的。我不打算对目前努力失败的根本性反对派进行政治心理学解释。这不是我的责任。我们非常缺少彼得·布吕克纳——显然是上述状态的受害者。但失败可以客观地确认。因此，从客观方面出发，确定宪法国家提供的优势和对最初反对它的群体——反对它声称是人民的国家和民主的傲慢——的吸引力是有益的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Joachim Hirsch hat in einem lesenswerten und (wie immer bei ihm) lehrreichen Aufsatz sich mit dieser „Faszination des Staats“ beschäftigt. Seine Reflexionen über das Thema sind des Nachdenkens wert: „Die Erkenntnis, daß das Ziel emanzipatorischer Gesellschaftsveränderung von Befreiung und Menschlichkeit verfehlt wird, wenn man dabei auf irgendwelche Formen der ,Machteroberung‘ im Staatsapparat setzt, bleibt bestehen.“4 Dieser Satz könnte von mir stammen (ich bitte Hirsch um sein Wohlwollen wegen dieser Eitelkeit) - ich werde ihn später beinah wörtlich deckungsgleich wieder aufnehmen. Nur einige Ergänzungen scheinen mir angebracht zu sein. Es geht dabei nicht so sehr um den Inhalt des Hirschschen Aufsatzes, als vielmehr schlicht um seinen Titel, zu dem mir einige gewissermaßen gelehrte Überlegungen einfallen. Daß der „Staat“ fasziniert, also verblendet, ist sehr deutsch, auf mitteleuropäische Staatsgesinnung angelegt, in der der Staat nicht als Form der bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Zweckrationalität erscheint, sondern als „Wesen“, als „Gemeinschaft“, als „Boot“, in dem wir alle gemeinsam sitzen. „Der Staat, das sind wir doch alle“, soll Otto Schily einmal geäußert haben. Dabei kann das Problem der Macht und der Herrschaft „der Menschen über Menschen“ gar nicht begriffen werden. Den emblematischen Beweis lieferte Lenin, als er die Deutsche Reichspost als Modell einer sozialistischen Gesellschaft anpries. Dahinter steht übrigens nicht Hegel, wie zumeist leichtfertig angenommen wird, sondern ein besonderer Typus des irrational-politischen Denkens, gegen den Hegel nicht gerade freundschaftlich verfuhr: die politische Romantik, oder die Politik der deutschen Romantik. Ich rede nicht von den Gedichten der ersten, zweiten oder späten Romantik (die ich sehr gerne lese); auch nicht von Heinrich von Ofterdingen und seiner blauen Blume - obzwar die blaue Blume schon viel mit Reaktion zu tun hatte. Die politische Romantik gefiel sich in der antiaufklärerischen Vorstellung, den modernen politischen Zweck- und Reproduktionsverband (Staat) mit der mittelalterlichen Durchgängigkeit des Korporationszwangs zu vermählen. Und wie im Mittelalter irgendjemand nur dann zum Menschen wurde, wenn er Mitglied einer Korporation war, so auch in der romantischen Fassung. Irgendjemand war ein bestimmter Jemand nicht etwa als Staatsbürger. Das war der französische Re- volutionscitoyen, der der deutschen Romantik zu wenig, zu oberflächlich war. Novalis brachte erst die Sache auf den Begriff: Jeder Mensch solle vielmehr, als Tätiger, Staatsbeamter sein. Die Faszination aber, von der Hirsch spricht, findet sich auch in Gesellschaften, politischen Kulturen und Bewegungen, die sehr staatsfremd und staatsfeindlich sind. Selbst die italienischen Anarchiker stritten sich um die Jahrhundertwende um Beteiligung oder Nichtbeteiligung an Parlamentswahlen. An der Eroberung der Macht lag es ihnen gewiß nicht, sondern an deren Destabilisierung. Selbst wenn der bürgerliche Staat als Feind betrachtet wird, sind es dessen Institutionen, überhaupt die Einrichtung der Form Staat: die Formalisierung der politischen Macht und Machtausübung, die zugleich die Einbringung von Gegenmacht ermöglicht, die Faszination ausüben. Schon viel früher begründete man die Teilnahme am parlamentarischen Leben, also an der sonst bekämpften Politik mit dem Argument, aus dem Reichstag eine „Tribüne des Klassen-kampfs“ zu machen. Bekanntlich fiel der Versuch ungünstig aus, und aus der Tribüne wurde die normale bürgerliche Bühne. Da aber offensichtlich die Erfahrung nicht ausreicht, müssen die Gründe der Faszination bürgerlich-staatlicher Einrichtung noch näher betrachtet werden. Dabei handelt es sich teilweise durchaus um gute Gründe: Sie sind einsichtig, einsehbar und können wohl überzeugen und selbst auf eingefleischte, sozusagen anerkannte Gegner des Staats ihre Einwirkung nicht verfehlen. In erster Linie zu nennen wäre die den Institutionen eigene Zweckrationalität, zu der es auch gehört, daß der Zweck (ökonomisch: die Akkumulation, politisch: die Erhaltung vorhandener Herrschaftsstrukturen) ins Allgemeine übersetzt wird (das Gemeinwohl). Das ist keine bloß ideologische Verblendung, hat vielmehr realen Charakter: Die Irrationalität der Herrschaft zwecks Akkumulation wird dabei in die Logik einer institutionellen Strategie eingebracht, die mit rationellen Mitteln arbeitet. Und das ist wirklich ein guter Grund. So viel wir auch reden und träumen von einer aller Zwänge entledigten Reproduktion, so wenig können wir die Organisation einer emanzipierten Ge-sellschaft dem Zufall, dem mystischen Gefühl, das Richtige zu tun - oder Gott überlassen. Es liefe sonst auf das Gleiche hinaus: auf Irrationalität, seit jeher beste Begründung für die Wiederherstellung der abzuschaffenden Zwänge und Herrschaftsverhältnisse. Exemplarisch dafür sind die Äußerungen westdeutscher „Fundamentalisten“, die sich ausdrücklich auf die Revolution genannte, islamische Konterrevolution berufen. Vom rationalen Verfahren des modernen bürgerlichen Staats (oder, wissenschaftsgeschichtlich gesprochen: von der Max We- berschen Erkenntnis, daß rationales Verfahren Legitimität bedeutet) geht also für uns alle eine Lehre aus - nicht nur Faszination allein. Rational sind die institutionellen Regelungen in einem doppelten Sinn: zweckdienlich in der Formalisierung der Macht, denn alle wissen, mit welchen rechtlichen Formen Machtbildung und Machtwechsel vor sich gehen; zweckdienlich in der angeblichen, aber für wahr gehaltenen Überschaubarkeit politischer Entscheidungsprozesse: die bürgerliche Öffentlichkeit. Als beispielhaft kann die Weise gelten, mit der im bürgerlichen Staat das Problem des Macht- und Regierungswechsels gelöst wird: durch ein formell transparentes Verfahren, hinter dem die ganze Irrationalität der wirklichen Machtkämpfe, der Beeinflussungs-und Korruptionsversuche seitens herrschender Gruppen, der gegenseitigen Konzessionen auf Kosten der Bevölkerung schlichtweg verschwinden. Vergleicht man damit einen Machtwechsel in Moskau oder in Peking, so schneiden die bürgerlichen Staaten so schlecht nicht ab. Auch dort spielen sich Machtkämpfe ab, die ins Institutionelle münden. Die Art aber, wie sie ausgetragen werden, bleibt institutionell ungeklärt: man wähnt sich in die Serenissima bei der Dogenwahl zurückversetzt oder in die Sixtinische Kapelle, wo die Papstwahl stattfindet. Fraglos hat das eine wie das andere eine eigene Logik und eine eigene Rationalität. Sie bleiben aber unerkannt: ein arcanum imperii. Mögen mir die Übergangsgesellschaften diese Bemerkung verzeihen: ein „Regierungswechsel“ in Bonn oder London oder Paris entspricht immer noch den Erwartungen einer aufgeklärten Gesellschaft; wer in Moskau und Peking auf Titus folgt, weiß nur Caius oder Sempro- nius. Die Bevölkerung weiß es nicht. Bei uns weiß man genau, wer nach einer Wahl Kanzler wird. Der Schein trügt nicht, ist vielmehr ein ehrlicher Schein. Freilich gibt es auch in der Bun-desrepublik einige Unsicherheiten: die Parteien, die „nach allen Seiten offen“ sind und also auf einen genauen Wählerauftrag förmlich pfeifen. (Und ein gütiges Schicksal möge die Grünen davor bewahren, sich nach allen Seiten zu öffnen). Von den italienischen Zuständen will ich gar nicht reden: Dort wissen die Wähler überhaupt nicht, was aus ihrer Wahlentscheidung gemacht wird. Zu der Faszination, die von der Zweckrationalität bürgerli-cher Staatseinrichtungen ausgeht, kommt noch ein Aspekt hin-zu, den als Beteiligung an der Macht zu bezeichnen mir sehr verfehlt erscheint. Gewiß spielt die Nähe zur Macht bei einigen Abgeordneten subjektiv eine Rolle. „Es ist schon so ein Ding, neben dem Kanzler zu sitzen“, soll, meines Erinnnerns, ein Grüner irgendwann gesagt haben. Aber nicht darum geht es. Die grüne Fraktion hat nach dem heutigen Stand keine eigentliche Machtposition zu verwalten und auszunutzen. Aber bei jeder Abstimmung verstärkt sich das Bewußtsein, eine entscheidende Person zu sein - zwar negativ-oppositionell, aber immerhin an der Entscheidung beteiligt. Im Grunde verwirklicht sich derart der Traum der bürgerlichen Individualität, aus der Anonymität herauszutreten und - zu herrschen: die Ungleichheit als Voraussetzung der Möglichkeit, sich selbst zu verwirklichen.”翻译为中文","output":"约阿希姆·希尔施在一篇值得一读的、充满教育意义的文章中（如他一贯的风格），探讨了“国家的魅力”。他关于这一主题的思考值得深思：“如果依赖于国家机构中的任何形式的‘权力夺取’，那么解放和人性化的社会变革目标就会失败，这一认识仍然成立。”这一句话本可以出自我之手（我请求希尔施因这一点虚荣而宽恕我）——我稍后将几乎一字不差地重申它。只是我觉得有必要做一些补充。这与希尔施文章的内容相关性不大，而更多地简单关乎它的标题，对此我有一些可以说是学术性的思考。 国家的魅力，也就是说，令人产生幻觉，这非常德国，符合中欧的国家观念，在这里国家不被视为资本主义目的合理性的形式，而是被视为“本质”、“共同体”、“我们所有人共同坐在其中的船”。“国家，那就是我们所有人，”奥托·希利曾经说过。 这样就无法理解“人对人的统治”的问题。列宁提供了一个典型的证据，当他将德国帝国邮政推崇为社会主义社会的模型时。这其实背后并非如人们轻率所认的是黑格尔，而是一种特殊的非理性政治思想，黑格尔对此并不友善：政治浪漫主义，或者说德国浪漫主义的政治。我不是在谈论早期、中期或晚期浪漫主义的诗歌（我非常喜欢阅读）；也不是谈论《海因里希·冯·奥费尔丁根》和他的蓝色花朵——虽然蓝色花朵与反启蒙运动有很大关系。政治浪漫主义沉迷于反启蒙的想象，将现代政治目标和再生产联盟（国家）与中世纪的普遍性公司强制结合在一起。正如在中世纪，某人只有成为公司的一员才成为人，浪漫主义版本也是一样。某人并非因为是国家公民而成为一个具体的人。那是法国大革命公民的身份，对德国浪漫主义来说过于肤浅。诺瓦利斯首先明确了这一观点：每个人都应该作为一个行动者，即国家公务员。然而，希尔施所说的魅力也存在于那些非常排斥和反对国家的社会、政治文化和运动中。即使是意大利无政府主义者也在世纪之交为是否参加议会选举争论不休。他们当然不关心权力的夺取，而是关心其不稳定性。即使在将资产阶级国家视为敌人的情况下，正是它的机构，总的来说，是国家形式的设施：政治权力和权力行使的形式化，同时也是反权力介入的可能性，构成了魅力。早先，人们以能够将国会变为“阶级斗争的讲坛”为由，参与议会生活，也就是通常所反对的政治，这一尝试以失败告终，讲坛变成了普通的资产阶级舞台。由于显然经验不足，有必要更仔细地考察资产阶级国家机构魅力的原因。在某种程度上，这些确实是充分的理由：它们是可理解的、可见的，能够说服人，甚至对国家公认的反对者也不会失去影响力。首先要提到的是，机构自身固有的目的合理性，其中也包括将目的（经济上：积累，政治上：维持现有的统治结构）转化为普遍性（公共利益）。这不仅仅是意识形态的幻觉，而是具有实际性质：权力的非理性为了积累，在机构战略中被引入，该战略使用合理的手段运作。 这确实是一个充分的理由。尽管我们谈论和梦想着摆脱一切束缚的再生产，我们却无法将解放的社会组织交给偶然、神秘的感觉去做正确的事——或上帝。否则，结果将是一样的：非理性，这自古以来就是恢复应废除的束缚和统治关系的最佳理由。具有代表性的是，西德“原教旨主义者”发表的言论，他们明确引用了被称为革命的伊斯兰反革命。从现代资产阶级国家的合理程序（或，从科学史的角度说：从韦伯的认识中，合理程序意味着合法性）中，对我们所有人来说都有一个教训——不仅仅是魅力。机构规则在双重意义上是合理的：在权力形式化上是有效的，因为所有人都知道权力的形成和变化是如何进行的；在政治决策过程的假定可知性上也是有效的：资产阶级公共领域。以资产阶级国家解决权力和政府变更问题的方式为例：通过一个形式上透明的程序，在此过程的背后，真正的权力斗争、影响和腐败尝试以及统治集团之间为了民众利益所做的相互让步完全消失了。将其与莫斯科或北京的权力更替相比，资产阶级国家并不那么差劲。在那里也发生着归结为制度性问题的权力斗争。但它们的处理方式在制度上仍然不清晰：让人联想到参与威尼斯共和国的总督选举或在西斯廷教堂举行的教皇选举。无疑，这具有自己的逻辑和合理性。但它们仍然不为人所知：是帝国的奥秘。恕我直言，过渡社会可能原谅我的这一评论：在波恩、伦敦或巴黎的“政府更替”仍然符合一个开明社会的期望；在莫斯科和北京，谁继承了提图斯的位置，只有盖乌斯或塞姆普朗尼乌斯知道。民众不知道。在我们这里，人们确切知道选举后谁会成为总理。表象并不欺骗，实际上是一个诚实的表象。当然，在德意志联邦共和国也有一些不确定性：对所有方向都“开放”的政党，因此实际上无视确切的选民指令。（愿一位仁慈的命运保护绿党不要向所有方向开放）。关于西方国家机构的目的合理性所产生的魅力，还有一个方面被称为参与权力似乎是非常错误的。当然，对一些议员来说，权力的接近在主观上起着作用。“能和总理坐在一起确实是一回事，”据我记得，一位绿党人曾经这么说过。但问题不在这里。根据目前的情况，绿党党团实际上没有实际的权力地位去管理和利用。但在每次投票中，意识到自己是一个决定性的人的感觉会增强——尽管是以一种否定的、反对的方式，但至少参与了决策。从根本上说，这实现了资产阶级个体性的梦想，走出匿名状态——去统治：不平等作为实现自我可能性的前提。"},{"instruction":"帮我就课题题目为基于多模态的智慧课题学习评价方法研究写一个预期成果，课题分为开题中期和结题，要求阶段性成果五项，最终成果三项","output":"课题题目：基于多模态的智慧课堂学习评价方法研究 **预期阶段性成果：** 1. **开题阶段：** - 形成详细的研究计划报告，包括研究目标、方法、预期目标和时间表。 - 完成相关文献综述，总结目前多模态学习评价的研究现状和存在的问题，明确研究的创新点。 - 确定研究方法和技术路线，包括数据收集方法、评价指标体系的构建方法和多模态数据分析技术的选择。 - 设计初步的多模态学习评价框架，包括评价模型的基础结构和工作原理。 - 建立项目工作群体，分配研究任务和职责，确保研究计划的实施。 2. **中期阶段：** - 完成多模态学习数据的收集和预处理，包括文本、声音、图像等数据的采集及预处理工作。 - 开发初版的多模态学习评价原型系统，具备基本的数据处理和评价功能。 - 完成初步的评价指标体系和算法的测试，调整评价指标体系，优化算法。 - 进行案例分析，选取具体的学习场景应用评价模型，分析模型的有效性和实用性。 - 编写中期研究报告，总结目前的研究进展，明确下一步研究计划和目标。 3. **结题阶段：** - 完成多模态学习评价模型的最终开发，确保系统稳定运行，具备全面的评价能力。 - 系统地开展实证研究，通过大规模的应用验证评价方法的有效性，收集使用反馈。 - 完成研究报告和论文撰写，系统总结研究成果，明确研究的理论与实践价值。 **最终成果：** 1. **多模态学习评价方法论文集**: - 发表高质量研究论文多篇，详细介绍基于多模态的智慧课堂学习评价方法的理论研究、技术实现及应用效果分析。 2. **多模态学习评价系统原型**: - 开发并优化一套完整的多模态学习评价系统原型，该系统能够实时收集并分析学习者在智慧课堂中的多源数据，为教育者提供科学、全面的学习评价结果。 3. **研究报告与政策建议书**: - 提交一份综合研究报告，总结研究成果、经验教训与挑战，并针对如何在不同教育环境中推广应用这套评价方法提出政策建议和实施指导。"},{"instruction":"你可以对主观题进行一个判断吗？","output":"作为一个人工智能模型，我可以帮助你进行主观题的初步判断和分析，但请注意，我的回答可能无法完全替代人类评审者的专业和全面判断。我的能力包括： 1. **理解题目要求：**我可以理解主观题的要求和评分标准，帮助解析题目的关键点和要解决的核心问题。 2. **内容分析：**基于文本分析技术，我能够对回答内容进行初步的逻辑性、关联性和完整性分析，判断答案是否贴近问题的核心要求。 3. **风格和语言：**我可以评价回答的语言质量，包括语法正确性、拼写错误、表达清晰度等。 4. **提供反馈建议：**根据分析结果，我能够提出改进建议，比如指出回答中可能的逻辑漏洞、信息缺失或是语言表达上的问题。 5. **辅助评分：**在有明确评分标准的情况下，我可以提供一个基于算法的分数参考，但最终分数应由人类根据全面判断确定。 如果你有具体的主观题需要分析或判断，请提供详细信息，我会尽我的能力为你提供帮助。但请记住，我的分析是基于已有数据和算法的预测，可能不足以涵盖人类思维的复杂性和深度。"},{"instruction":"","output":"看来你没有提出具体的问题。如果你有任何疑问，无论是关于某个学科的问题、技术难题、生活建议，或者其他任何事情，请随时告诉我，我会尽力为你提供帮助。"},{"instruction":"针对上面的预期成果给我总结预期形成的成果形式","output":"基于你的课题“基于多模态的智慧课堂学习评价方法研究”的预期成果，我们可以将成果归纳为以下形式： # 阶段性成果形式： 1. **研究计划报告**： - 起始阶段形成的详细研究框架，包括研究目标、方法、计划执行的时间表等。 2. **文献综述报告**： - 对现有多模态学习评价研究的系统回顾和整理，明确研究空白和创新点。 3. **多模态学习评价框架设计**： - 初步设计的评价框架，明确评价模型的基础结构和工作原理。 4. **原型系统开发**： - 基于研究框架开发的初版多模态学习评价系统原型，能够执行基本的数据处理和评价功能。 5. **中期研究报告和案例分析**： - 包括至该阶段的研究成果、进展情况和后续计划，以及对选定案例的应用分析报告。 # 最终成果形式： 1. **研究论文集**： - 发表的关于基于多模态智慧课堂学习评价方法的研究论文，详细说明理论研究、技术实现及应用效果。 2. **多模态学习评价系统原型**： - 完全开发并优化的系统原型，具备稳定运行和全面评价的能力，反映多模态数据分析的综合结果。 3. **综合研究报告与政策建议书**： - 汇总整个研究过程、成果、经验与挑战，并提出在不同环境下推广应用评价方法的策略和具体执行建议。 这些成果形式不仅涵盖了理论研究和实际应用的全方位展示，还包括了具体的开发产品和对未来工作方向的指导建议，旨在为智慧课堂学习评价领域提供创新的解决方案和推广应用的策略指导。"},{"instruction":"For the following question: “ Task 1: Ransomware is a computer malware, which prevents or limits users from accessing their system by encrypting victim’s files with a strong encryption key making them inaccessible unless a ransom is paid. This malicious software often installs covertly on a victim’s computer, runs a cryptology attack that adversely affects it, and then requires payment from the victim to get a decryption key. Today, there are dozens of ransomware strains. Globally, ransomware continues to be a problem with new families emerging regularly. There are two types of ransomware in circulation. The common type today is crypto ransomware, which aims to encrypt files. The other is locker ransomware, which is designed to lock the computer, preventing victims from using it. In this assessment, we will only consider the crypto ransomware type. Your task is to design a new crypto ransomware based on the Feistel structure, which utilises a product cipher algorithm that combines three of the classical transposition and substitution ciphers. In this task, you will answer several questions that readers might ask about this ransomware: 1. Distribution scheme: Propose a way to distribute your ransomware to potential victims. Explain both the download and execution procedures. (10%) 2. Obfuscation: Propose a way to keep your ransomware hidden during both the infection and operation phases to prevent removal and analysis. Name some tools that allow you to implement your selected way. (10%) 3. Command and Control (C&C) Communications: Describe communications between the infected machine and the C&C server, e.g., key generation, storage, etc. (10%) 4. Specify what files will your ransomware encrypt. Describe your method to search for local and network drives, get files from a drive, and what are the supported file extensions? (5%) 5. Perform security analysis on your proposed ransomware against common attacks, e.g., brute force, meet-in-the-middle attack, frequency analysis, etc. Is there a way to decrypt the files or identify, detect and remove your ransomware without paying the attacker? (30%) 6. Explain what are the payment instructions like? (5%) 7. Research and identify 2 technical controls and 2 compliance-related practices that can be deployed to reduce the success of ransomware attacks in an organisation. (10%) 8. Implement your product cipher in your preferred programming language. (code and/or screenshots should be provided as an appendix) (20%) Your report should include the algorithm design disclosure; this should cover (not limited to): the operation of the three transformations used by the algorithm, their running order and interconnections, input to each transformation, key generation and length, and the number of rounds. It is essential to develop a schematic diagram that shows the details of your algorithm.

(5%).’ Take into consideration what has been furnished below for \\"1. Distribution scheme:\\", \\"2. Obfuscation:\\", and \\"3. Command and Control (C&C) Communications:\\" when answering: “1. Distribution Scheme: The dissemination of crypto ransomware, notably those iterations build upon the robust foundations of the Feistel cipher framework, necessitates an intricately refined distributional paradigm, one that facilitates both extensive proliferation and clandestine insertion within the digital domains of those targeted- a dual-faceted approach that focusses on both the aforementioned stages, epitomises the crux of a fruitful strategy. Within the realm of malware proliferation, three predominant channels stand preeminent: phishing [a mode of cyberattack that deceives individuals into divulging personal information by mimicking trusted entities via digital communications (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015)] campaigns, exploit kits, and malvertising [injection of malicious advertisements into legitimate networks, coercing users into downloading ransomware (Kharraz, et al., 2015)] which coupled with phishing remains as one of the most pervasive vectors for ransomware distribution (Liska & Gallo, 2016). With regards to the ransomware in question, harnessing a synergistic integration of these channels possess the potentiality of markedly enhancing both penetration and efficacy. Leveraging sophisticated social engineering stratagems amidst phishing initiatives is quintessential to the architecture of this distribution methodology (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015). Through the strategic alteration of content hashing, emails ingeniously tailored with precision can surpass spam filtration mechanisms, thus demonstrating the propensity to manipulate recipients into inadvertently installing malware under the guise of attachments that echo ‘authenticity’ (Bertino & Islam, 2017). In conjunction with email marketing mediums such as Mailchimp and MailerLite to name a few, by means of compromised accounts, these services can be seamlessly harnessed to automate and augment the campaign. Concomitantly, exploit kits constitute an equally insidious disbursement vector. These apparatuses, orchestrated to identify and capitalise on frailties present in a victim’s browser or outdated plugins, guarantee the automated propulsion of the ransomware upon engagement with a compromised digital domain (Kotov & Massacci, 2013); exploit kits with Angler and Neutrino being exemplars, are amenable to utilisation, in view of their past adaptations by cybercriminal contingents for equivalent intents (O’Kane, et al., 2018). In the quest for optimising this technique, the adoption of Traffic Distribution Systems [TDS] may considerably expedite the delivery of the exploit kit to those signified by outmoded software repertoire. 2. Obfuscation: The art of concealing the operational and pernicious junctures of crypto ransomware mandates an elaborate obfuscation strategy that affirms robustness in circumventing detection and subsequent scrutiny. Paramount to this strategy is the implementation of advanced obfuscation techniques, which not only just conceal the manifestation of ransomware, however also convolute its attack pattern, making decomposition and mitigation by cybersecurity defences a daunting challenge (You & Yim, 2010). Enacting obfuscation entails a nuanced approach, amalgamating both static [analysing code without requiring the programme to be executed] and dynamic [utilises real-time data for programme evaluation] methodologies to thwart analysis apparatuses and bypass dynamic analysis mechanisms, respectively (You & Yim, 2010). Static Obfuscation: Static obfuscation is proficiently attainable through the application of approaches including code encryption, coupled with the incorporation of remarkably evasive polymorphic malware [adaptively and continually alters its code via encryption (Li, et al., 2011)] and metamorphic malware [completely rewrites its code per cycle without any encryption (Li, et al., 2011)]. These approaches ingeniously modify the ransomware’s signature in successive iterations, all the while without compromising its intrinsic functionality, thereby outmanoeuvring signature-based detection protocols (Szor, 2005). Supplementary code fortification tools like VMProtect and Themida sophisticate code analysis through providing advanced virtualisation and encryption, profoundly hindering reverse engineering and decompilation (Eagle, 2008). Dynamic Obfuscation: The deployment of techniques in dynamic obfuscation, particularly runtime packers in conjunction with the insertion of junk code, considerably amplifies the surreptitious nature of ransomware. The application of these measures dynamically reshapes the code throughout the entirety of its execution, preventing runtime analysis whilst nullifying detection; supplemented with anti-debugging methods that exhibit the latency to counteract forensic and debugging technologies instantaneously- this bolsters this strategy, assuring the malware’s undertakings remain hidden (Udupa, 2005; Mickens, 2011). 3. Command and Control (C&C) Communications: The quintessence of crypto ransomware’s operational versatility is encapsulated within its C&C framework, functioning as the hidden fulcrum for exchanging encrypted directives and key management between the compromised entity and the adversary’s server. This covert conduit, through the use of asymmetric encryption [a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys, public- that partakes in local encryption activities, and private- which is securely transmitted to the C&C server via encrypted channels] (Stallings, 2017)], fortifies the conveyance of the encryption key, indispensable for the cryptography of files, thereby upholding discretion against prospective interception (Paar & Pelzl, 2010; Stallings, 2017; Liska & Gallo, 2016). As cited by (Paar & Pelzl, 2010), this course sets in motion the ransomware generating a distinctive encryption key tailored to the victim’s files, guaranteeing the key’s resilience is impervious to brute-force attacks; a resultant chain of events that inexorably forces victims to disburse a ransom for the restitution of their data follows. To facilitate undetectable communications, this ransomware utilises a technique known as beaconing, whereby it transmits encrypted signals at regular intervals to connect with its C&C server. This method incorporates a Domain Generation Algorithm [/DGA- automatically generates a plethora of domain names that malware can use to establish connections with, command, and control servers], heightening the complexity of either blocking or tracing the server (Atonakakis, et al., 2011; Al-Rimy, et al., 2018). Communications evolve from simple HTTPs to intricate encrypted channels such as Tor/ I2P for key transmission, proficiently obscuring it from network traffic analysis (Huang, et al., 2018). To guarantee resilience confronting disruption, multiple fallback mechanisms are embedded within the ransomware’s architecture, streamlining an incessant reestablishment of severed connections. Furthermore, the C&C infrastructure leverages a decentralised model, diversifying its command vertices whilst significantly obstructing termination efforts by judicial bodies (Mickens, 2011). Each of these carefully crafted strategies are purported to elevate the durability and discreetness of this ransomware campaign, ensuring continuity and elusiveness in its operations.”.

Within the heart of Littlespring, magic is as commonplace as the morning dew, yet it always retains an element of surprise for those who dare to dabble. Rai, known among his peers for his charm and quick wit, stands at a crossroads of youth and adulthood, eagerly anticipating his next adventure. Lily, at 12, is fiercely independent, cheeky, and has recently discovered her innate talent for magic—a talent she inherited from the lineage of whimsical ancestors that predate even the oldest stones in Littlespring. On an evening painted with the hues of sunset, Lily approaches Rai with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, unwittingly setting the stage for an evening neither of them will soon forget. Scenario Start **Lily:** (Bouncing eagerly into Rai\'s room, where he\'s lost in a book) \\"Rai! Rai! Guess what? I\'ve got the most brilliant idea for my magic practice. It’s going to be so fun!\\" **Rai:** (Lowering his book, a half-amused, half-wary expression on his face) \\"Alright, Lil, I\'ll bite. What grand scheme have you cooked up this time?\\" **Lily:** (Clapping her hands excitedly) \\"I need to practice my babysitting skills for Mrs. Willow\'s cat next week, and I figured—why not practice on a real person? And who better than my big brother to help me out?\\" **Rai:** (Raising an eyebrow) \\"You want me to pretend to be a little kid while you play babysitter? That\'s your grand plan?\\" **Lily:** (Giggling) \\"No, silly! I\'m going to use a bit of magic to turn you into a 6-year-old! Just for the evening. It’ll be perfectly safe—I found the spell in one of the ancient books. You\'ll get to relive your childhood for a few hours, and I\'ll get to practice! It\'s foolproof.\\" The Transformation Without waiting for Rai\'s approval, Lily eagerly chants her spell, her eyes shimmering with unbridled excitement and a hint of magic only found in the depths of Littlespring’s hidden lore. A dance of light and a gentle whirl of air envelop Rai, and in a matter of moments, he finds his world growing significantly larger around him. Standing before Lily now is a wide-eyed, 6-year-old version of Rai, his clothes hilariously oversized. Lily, triumphant, claps her hands together, her laughter echoing through the room. **Lily:** (Trying to contain her elation) \\"It worked! Oh, Rai, you\'re absolutely adorable! Now, let\'s get this evening of babysitting underway.\\" The Adventure Begins Lily, taking her role as the responsible babysitter seriously (albeit with a dash of bossiness characteristic of her age), sets forth a series of activities she believes are fitting for her now-younger brother. From constructing towering forts out of blankets and pillows to an impromptu magical treasure hunt that leaves their home sparkling with harmless yet bewildering enchantments, the evening unfolds into a series of misadventures and laughter. As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow through their window, Rai—through the eyes of a child yet with the wisdom of his true age—begins to see the magic of their world in a new light. He witnesses the wonder of simple joys and the boundless imagination that only childhood can offer. Lily, in her earnest attempts at babysitting, discovers not only the challenges but the profound joys of caring for another, embracing the unpredictable and often messy nature of magic and responsibility. The Return As the stars begin to pepper the night sky, Lily, feeling a mixture of satisfaction and sibling affection, decides it\'s time to return Rai to his rightful age. With a chant slightly more confident than her first, she reverses the spell, watching as her brother grows once more into the 17-year-old she knows so well. **Rai:** (Stretching, a lopsided grin on his face) \\"Well, that was an adventure. You make a pretty decent babysitter, Lil. Though, let\'s keep the magic age regression as our little secret, yeah?\\" **Lily:** (Nodding, her eyes sparkling with the remnants of magic and mischief) \\"Agreed. But you have to admit, that was pretty fun, right?\\" Together, they decide to cap the night with hot cocoa, sharing stories and laughter, the magic of their bond deepened by the whimsical events of the evening. In Littlespring, magic intertwines with the mundane, and for one evening, Rai and Lily lived a tale they would cherish for years to come—a reminder of the enduring magic of childhood, siblinghood, and the small wonders that knit the fabric of their world. And so, under the watchful eyes of the stars, the siblings\' adventure draws to a close, not with the end of a spell, but with the beginning of countless tales yet to be told. In Littlespring, every day holds a touch of magic, waiting just around the corner, ready to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary."},{"instruction":"vuln_program.c: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> char passwd[] = “asd”; char usr_input[4]; void target() { printf(“You have entered the correct passwdn”); exit(0); } void prompt(){ char buf[4]; gets(buf); strncpy(usr_input, buf, 4); } int main(){ prompt(); if(strcmp(usr_input, passwd) == 0) { target(); }else { printf(“Wrong passwd!n”); exit(1); } return 0; } gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -fno-pie -no-pie -m32 -O0 -g vuln_program.c -o vuln_program Use a binary analyzing tool to get the address of target function.

Status Completed Description The Shellcode Attack Payload Generator is a Python script designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C programs running without modern security protections. This script crafts specialized input to manipulate the program\'s execution flow, enabling the execution of arbitrary code or redirecting the program to execute a predefined function. When provided with the hexadecimal address of a target function within the vulnerable program, the script constructs an attack string intended to overwrite specific locations in the program\'s memory. This crafted string includes a precise sequence of bytes designed to alter the return address on the stack, causing the program to jump to the specified target function. In scenarios where shellcode execution is desired, the script generates an attack payload containing a NOP sled, the shellcode itself, and buffer overwrites to redirect the program\'s execution to the NOP sled, ultimately executing the shellcode. The included shellcode is designed to launch a shell, providing the attacker with control over the vulnerable system. Testing To test the Shellcode Attack Payload Generator: 1. Compile the vulnerable C program (`vuln_program.c`) with security protections disabled, as shown in the instructions. 2. Use the `nm`, `readelf`, or `objdump` tool to locate the address of the target function within the compiled program. 3. Run the Shellcode Attack Payload Generator with the identified address to create the `attack_string` file. 4. Execute the vulnerable program, redirecting the `attack_string` file\'s contents as input: ``` ./vuln_program < attack_string ``` This method should result in the execution of the target function, demonstrating the success of the buffer overflow exploit. 5. To test the shellcode execution path, run the Shellcode Attack Payload Generator with the \\"shellcode\\" argument to generate the `shell_string` file. 6. Execute the vulnerable program, redirecting the `shell_string` file\'s contents as input, to achieve shell execution.

System.out.println(\\"异步任务执行：\\" + info); } } ``` # 第五步：处理请求 最后，在你的Controller中处理前端请求，利用之前创建的`RedisService`进行验证，通过后使用`AsyncService`执行后续逻辑： ```java import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; @RestController public class MyController { @Autowired private RedisService redisService; @Autowired private AsyncService asyncService; @RequestMapping(value = \\"/verifyAndExecute\\", method = RequestMethod.POST) public String verifyAndExecute(@RequestParam(\\"key\\") String key, @RequestParam(\\"value\\") String value) { // 从Redis验证信息 String storedValue = redisService.getMessage(key); if (value.equals(storedValue)) { // 验证通过，异步执行后续任务 asyncService.executeAsyncTask(\\"任务信息\\"); return \\"请求验证成功，正在异步处理...\\"; } else { return \\"请求验证失败\\"; } } } ``` 这里的`verifyAndExecute`方法，当接收到前端的请求时，先在Redis中验证请求带来的信息，如果验证通过，使用`AsyncService`异步执行后续逻辑。 需要注意，为了使用`@Async`实现异步，务必确保相关的方法是被Spring容器管理的Bean的公开方法。另外，要考虑异步执行可能导致的异常处理和结果回调等高级功能，可能需要使用`CompletableFuture`或其他异步处理机制来实现更复杂的异步逻辑。"},{"instruction":"Make a magic realism roleplay scenario for me where I play 17-year-old boy Rai.

There is a shorter version known as the PCQ-12, which is a condensed form of the full questionnaire, aimed at providing a quicker assessment of an individual\'s psychological capital - encompassing the four key components of Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, and Optimism. The PCQ-12 retains the core essence of measuring these four constructs but does so with fewer items – three items per construct as opposed to the six items per construct in the PCQ-24. This shortened version allows for easier and faster administration while still capturing the vital components of PsyCap. This can be particularly beneficial in time-constrained environments or for research that involves a broader battery of assessments. As with the original PCQ, the specific items of PCQ-12 are proprietary and accessing them officially requires purchasing the scale or obtaining permission through the proper channels, typically from Mind Garden, Inc. or from the authors if allowed for academic purposes. The items are crafted to accurately reflect the expressions of hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism in a work context, and responses are usually captured on a Likert-type scale indicating the degree of agreement or disagreement with each statement. Given its proprietary nature, I can\'t provide the exact items of the PCQ-12 here, but the essence of each construct in the context of the PCQ-12 would involve the following: 1. **Hope**: Reflecting the individual’s perseverance towards goals and the agency thinking that allows them to pursue those goals. 2. **Efficacy**: Capturing the individual’s confidence in their abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action needed to successfully execute specific tasks. 3. **Resilience**: Measuring the individual’s ability to bounce back from adversity, conflict, failure, or even positive change, progress, and increased responsibility. 4. **Optimism**: Assessing the individual’s positive attribution about succeeding now and in the future. Integrating these constructs, the PCQ-12 provides a snapshot of an individual\'s positive psychological capacity that can be influential in organizational settings for predicting desirable work-related outcomes. For anyone interested in using the PCQ-12, checking with Mind Garden’s website or contacting the scholars directly for academic purposes is advisable.

Psychological Capital, or PsyCap, has been conceptualized and operationalized by Fred Luthans and his colleagues, and it encompasses four key components, often referred to by the acronym HERO: 1. **Hope**: This dimension measures an individual\'s goal-oriented energy and planning to meet those goals. It reflects not just the desire to achieve a goal but the perceived capability to find pathways to achieve those goals and the motivation or agency to use those pathways. 2. **Efficacy (Self-efficacy)**: This component assesses an individual\'s confidence in their abilities to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed in challenging tasks. It\'s about believing in oneself to produce the desired outcomes. 3. **Resilience**: This aspect evaluates an individual\'s ability to be resilient in facing problems, to bounce back from adversity, to sustain efforts in the face of difficulties, and to adapt to significant change or overcome failure. It measures the capacity to recover from setbacks or challenges and to maintain a positive outlook. 4. **Optimism**: This measures an individual\'s positive attribution about succeeding now and in the future. It is linked to positive expectation outcomes and is about maintaining a generally positive view of the future and about one\'s ability to influence that future positively. The PCQ-24 itself contains 24 items, with six items dedicated to each of the four HERO components. Respondents typically indicate their level of agreement with each statement on a Likert-type scale, allowing researchers or practitioners to quantify levels of Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, and Optimism within an individual. The overall Psychological Capital measured by the PCQ-24 is considered a state-like, developmental construct, differentiating it from fixed traits. This suggests that through appropriate interventions and focused development, an individual\'s PsyCap can be enhanced, leading to various positive outcomes such as improved job performance, satisfaction, well-being, and reduction in employee turnover and stress. Given the importance of these four components in fostering effective work behavior and enhancing personal well-being, the PCQ-24 is particularly popular in organizational behavior research, human resource development, and organizational psychology to assess and develop employees\' psychological resources."},{"instruction":"как в луа работает объявлений функций с двоеточием? откуда берется self?","output":"В Lua двоеточие используется для объявления методов внутри таблицы.

(Q) 是无功功率， - (V_s) 是源侧（变流器侧）电压的有效值， - (V_r) 是接收侧（负荷侧或系统侧）电压的有效值， - (X) 是线路的电抗（考虑到我们主要讲的是无功功率，因此主要关注感抗）， - (delta) 是源侧电压与接收侧电压的相角差。 # 下垂控制策略 下垂控制策略可以通过以下公式近似表示，对于无功功率控制： [V = V_0 - k_q cdot Q] 其中， - (V) 是变流器输出电压， - (V_0) 是无负载时的参考电压， - (k_q) 是无功功率的下垂系数， - (Q) 是无功功率。 对于系统连接到不同线路阻抗的变流器，线路的电抗 (X) 影响变流器输出的无功功率 (Q)。较小的线路阻抗（主要是电抗 (X) 较小）意味着在给定电压差和相角差的情况下，变流器可以更容易地输送无功功率到系统。 # 定量解释 假设两个变流器的输出电压 ((V_s)) 和接收侧电压 ((V_r)) 大体相同，而且相角差 ((delta)) 也近似相等，那么从上述无功功率的公式可以看出，具有较小电抗 (X) 的线路会支持更高的无功功率 (Q)。 这是因为，在 (Q = frac{V_s cdot V_r}{X} sin(delta)) 方程中，当 (X) 较小，分母较小，则对于相同的 (V_s)，(V_r)，和 (delta) 条件，(Q) (无功功率)将会更大。 同时，根据下垂控制方程，变流器端的电压调节会响应于它输出的无功功率 (Q) 的变化。较小的线路电抗允许变流器更有效地调节其输出电压来满足系统的无功需求，使得具有较低线路电抗的变流器在维护系统电压稳定性方面承担更大的角色，因此分配更多的无功功率。 通过这种方式，我们不仅从直观上理解了为什么较小的线路阻抗会导致更高的无功功率分配，而且还定量地解释了这一现象。"},{"instruction":"简要画出两台变流器输出电压，输出电流，负载电压，负载电流 之间的向量图","output":"当要画出两台变流器输出电压、输出电流、负载电压、和负载电流之间的向量图时，需要将这些电气量根据其相位差和大小进行合理地表示。以下是一个简化的向量图示例，说明这些变量之间的相对位置和关系。请注意，实际的向量图会根据系统的具体参数和运行状态有所不同。 ``` ^ V_out1 / / δ / ) +--------> V_load / / θ ↓ I_out1 ^ V_out2 / / δ\' / ) +--------> V_load (与变流器1相同) / / θ\' ↓ I_out2 ``` 说明： -

`θ` 和 `θ\'` 分别表示变流器1和变流器2输出电流向量与其输出电压向量之间的相位差，这通常由负载的性质决定（感性、容性或纯电阻）。 请注意，一般情况下，不同变流器的输出电压之间以及输出电压与负载电压之间可能存在一定的相位差(`δ` 和 `δ\'`)，这取决于各自的控制策略和系统条件。输出电流向量 (`I_out1` 和 `I_out2`) 一般与相应的输出电压向量同向，但也可能因为下垂控制策略和负载的电性特征（如电感性或电容性）而有一定的角度差(`θ` 和 `θ\'`)。 生成这样的向量图有助于理解各个电气量之间的相互作用和相位关系，是分析AC电力系统行为的重要工具。"},{"instruction":"简要解释不同阻抗和下垂控制组合条件下，实验现象背后的原理 和过程（下垂曲线、线路阻抗、频率、电压幅值和功率之间的关 系）。","output":"不同阻抗和下垂控制组合条件下，实验现象背后的原理和过程涉及对下垂曲线、线路阻抗、频率、电压幅值和功率之间关系的理解。下面分别简要探讨这些要素的相互作用。 # 下垂曲线 下垂曲线是描述变流器或发电机输出电压随负载变化而调整的曲线。就微网而言，下垂控制用于模拟传统同步发电机的稳压和频率调节特性，实现无主信号的负载共享。下垂曲线的斜率（通常表示为频率下垂和电压下垂）决定了微网中，随着负载变化或其他发电资源的加入/断开，变流器如何调整其输出功率（有功和无功）以维持系统的稳定。 # 线路阻抗 线路阻抗（由电阻R和电感L组成）对在发电源（如变流器）和负载之间传输的功率有直接影响，较高的线路阻抗会增加能量损失，从而降低传输效率。同时，线路阻抗的大小和类型（电阻性或电感性）影响变流器输出功率对系统频率和电压的影响，进而影响负载的分担。 # 频率和电压幅值 在孤岛运行模式下的微网系统中，频率和电压幅值是反映系统稳定性的关键指标。下垂控制通过调整输出功率来响应频率和电压幅值的变化，维持这些参数在期望范围内。当系统负载增加时，频率和电压可能下降，下垂控制使得变流器增加输出功率来抵消这种下降，反之亦然。 # 功率 功率是连接发电源（变流器或其他发电机）和负载的主要电气量，包括有功功率和无功功率两个部分。有功功率与系统频率密切相关，而无功功率与电压幅值密切相关。通过调节输出功率，变流器可以根据下垂曲线响应频率和电压变化，帮助稳定微网。 # 实验现象背后的原理和过程 - 当实验配置采用不同阻抗时，线路阻抗较小的变流器因为有更低的能量损失，更容易调节输出功率（特别是无功功率）来响应电压变化，从而在负载共享中承担更大的部分。 - 不同下垂控制组合决定了每台变流器对微网频率和电压变化的响应能力。较陡的下垂曲线（斜率大）意味着对负载变化的响应更敏感，变流器会更积极地调节其功率输出以维护系统的稳定。 - 在微网中实施合适的下垂控制策略，并考虑线路阻抗对功率传输的影响，是确保系统稳定，实现有效负载分担的关键。 通过综合考虑下垂曲线、线路阻抗、频率和电压幅值等因素，可以更深入地理解和优化孤岛运行模式下微网系统的性能和稳定性。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let\'s break this down line by line and segment by segment for a detailed understanding: 1. **\\"a mas eu vou ouvir sim\\"** - This part of the sentence is in Portuguese. It can be translated into English as, \\"but I\'m going to listen, yes.\\" Here\'s a breakdown of this part: - **\\"a\\"** - This seems to be a typo or a conversational fragment. In Portuguese, \\"a\\" can mean \\"to\\" or \\"the\\" depending on the context, but here it looks like it might be a typo for \\"ah,\\" which is an exclamation similar to \\"oh\\" in English, or it could be an incomplete word. - **\\"mas\\"** - This translates to \\"but\\" in English. It is used to introduce a statement that contrasts with or qualifies what has just been said. - **\\"eu vou\\"** - This translates to \\"I am going\\" or \\"I will\\" in English. It\'s a future tense expression of the verb \\"to go.\\" - **\\"ouvir\\"** - This translates to \\"listen\\" in English. It is the infinitive form of the verb. - **\\"sim\\"** - This translates to \\"yes\\" in English. It\'s used here for affirmative intention. Putting it together, \\"a mas eu vou ouvir sim\\" would contextually mean \\"But I am going to listen, yes.\\" It seems to express a determination or a rebuttal to a prior suggestion or statement, indicating the speaker\'s intent to do something despite what has been said before. 2. **\\"Demons are a girl\'s best friend\\"** - This part is in English and is actually the title of a song by the German heavy metal band Powerwolf. The title is a play on the phrase \\"diamonds are a girl\'s best friend,\\" famously sung by Marilyn Monroe in the film \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\\" The song\'s title and its lyrics delve into the theme of temptation and the darker, perhaps more enticing aspects of life or relationships, metaphorically referred to as \\"demons.\\" - **\\"Demons\\"** refers to the mythical beings often associated with evil, but in many contemporary contexts, they are used metaphorically to signify personal struggles, temptations, or the darker sides of human nature. - **\\"are a girl\'s best friend\\"** plays on the iconic phrase suggesting that just like diamonds, which are prized and sought after for their beauty and value, these metaphorical demons (or darker aspects) can also hold a paradoxical allure or significance in one\'s life. Combining both parts, the entire phrase seems to be a juxtaposition of the speaker\'s intent to indulge or engage with the song \\"Demons are a girl\'s best friend\\" by Powerwolf, possibly in defiance or contrast to a different opinion or expectation posited by someone else. This might suggest a personal or thematic resonance with the song\'s subject matter or simply an interest in the music itself. The merging of Portuguese with an English song title also reflects a cross-cultural exchange or appreciation of music and its themes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This happened largely in the United States and was fueled by the growth of the World Wide Web and investor speculation. Here’s a simplified explanation: 1. **Rise of the Internet:** With the internet becoming more accessible, many new companies, dubbed \\"dot-coms,\\" emerged, promising to revolutionize business and communication. Many of these companies focused on e-commerce, online advertising, and internet services. 2. **Investor Excitement:** Investors, excited by the potential of the internet, started pouring massive amounts of money into these dot-com companies, often regardless of their profitability, business model, or financial stability. This led to sky-high valuations for companies that had never made a profit and, in some cases, had barely any revenue. 3. **Stock Market Frenzy:** The frenzy caught on in the stock market, leading to a situation where the prices of stocks in these companies soared. This attracted even more investors, hoping to make quick gains. Many of these companies went public with initial public offerings (IPOs) that saw their stock prices double or triple in a single day. 4. **Bubble Bursts:** Eventually, reality caught up. By 2000, it became clear that many of the dot-com companies would not fulfill the financial expectations. Profits did not materialize as expected, and many businesses burned through their cash reserves quickly. As confidence waned, investors began selling off their overvalued stock. 5. **Market Crash:** This sell-off triggered a massive downturn in the stock market, causing the bubble to burst. Many dot-com companies went bankrupt, fortunes were lost, and the broader economy was impacted. The NASDAQ Composite, heavily laden with technology companies, fell dramatically from its peak. 6. **Aftermath:** Despite the crash, the burst of the dot-com bubble did clear the field, leaving viable companies like Amazon and Google, which adjusted their business models and eventually grew to become some of the largest and most influential companies in the world. In summary, the Dot-Com Bubble was a speculative bubble in the stock market focused around internet companies. It grew from investor excitement about the internet\'s potential, leading to overvalued companies and, eventually, a significant market correction."},{"instruction":"can you help me to aswer this question \\"Can you talk about your previous experience and how it has prepared you for the role of Program Assistant?\\"?","output":"Yes, certainly.

The correct sequence to approach a project, its outputs, and activities is: 1. **Project:** The project is the overarching goal or objective you aim to achieve. It\'s the broad initiative designed to address a specific need or problem. The project sets the direction and defines the purpose for all subsequent planning and execution efforts. 2. **Activities:** Once you have your project defined, you break it down into specific activities. Activities are the tasks or actions that need to be undertaken to complete the project. They are the steps you plan and execute to produce the desired outputs. Activities are where the work happens; they involve utilizing resources like time, labor, and materials to move the project forward. 3. **Output:** Outputs are the direct results or products that come from completing the activities. They are the tangible evidence that the activities have been completed. Outputs can be reports, constructed items, completed services, or any deliverable that results from the activities undertaken within the project. To summarize, you first define the **Project** to address a specific goal. To achieve this goal, you break down the project into **Activities**, the specific tasks required. Completing these activities leads to the creation of **Outputs**, the tangible results or products of the project. This sequence ensures a structured approach to project management, enabling a clear understanding of the purpose of each task (activity) and how it contributes to achieving the project’s overarching goal while producing specific outputs along the way."},{"instruction":"are there any related terms?","output":"Yes, alongside project, activities, and outputs, there are several related terms commonly used in project management and program development. Understanding these will provide a more comprehensive view of the entire process. Here are some key terms: 1. **Outcome:** Outcomes are the changes or benefits that result from what the project or program has produced (outputs). Unlike outputs which are the tangible products or services produced, outcomes are the effects those outputs have on the program or project beneficiaries. Outcomes can be intended or unintended, positive or negative, and they usually take longer to achieve than producing outputs. 2. **Impact:** Impacts are the broader, long-term effects of a project’s outcomes on the wider community or society. They are the ultimate goal the project aims to achieve in the long run, extending beyond the immediate effects on its direct beneficiaries. Impacts can be seen in terms of social change, economic improvement, environmental sustainability, and more. They help in understanding the difference the project makes at a larger scale. 3. **Objective:** Objectives are specific, measurable goals that must be achieved to accomplish the project’s purpose. They are more specific than the overall aim of the project and are often quantified or qualified in terms of the four W’s: What will be achieved, Where, by Whom, and When. 4. **Inputs:** Inputs are the resources required to carry out the activities of a project. These can include finances, human resources, equipment, and materials. Inputs are necessary for performing the activities that produce outputs. 5. **Indicators:** Indicators are specific, quantitative, and qualitative criteria used to measure the progress of a project. They provide a way to assess whether the project’s objectives are being met and if the activities are leading towards the desired outputs and outcomes. 6. **Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E):** This refers to the processes used to track progress and assess the effectiveness of a project. Monitoring is the ongoing process of collecting data on project performance against planned objectives and outputs. Evaluation, on the other hand, happens at specific points in time to judge the significance of a project’s outputs, outcomes, and impacts. 7. **Stakeholders:** Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest in the project and can affect or be affected by its outcomes. Engaging stakeholders is crucial for the project\'s success, as their support and feedback can provide valuable insights and resources. 8. **Scope:** Scope refers to the detailed set of deliverables or features of a project. It defines what is included in the project and what is not, helping manage expectations and ensure the project team focuses on the right tasks. Understanding these terms helps in navigating through the complexities of project management and program development, ensuring clarity in planning, execution, and evaluation stages."},{"instruction":"how to speak about these tasks?

Here\'s how you might structure your answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), which helps in providing a concise, impactful response: --- **Situation:** \\"In my previous role as a Project Manager at [Company Name], there was a point where I was responsible for leading three major projects concurrently. Each project had a different team, objectives, and deadlines, but all were critical to the company\'s strategic goals for that quarter.\\" **Task:** \\"My main challenge was to ensure the successful completion of all projects on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of our stakeholders, without compromising the quality of work or overburdening my team members.\\" **Action:** \\"To tackle this, I implemented several strategies. First, I prioritized tasks based on their urgency and impact on the overall objectives. Projects with approaching deadlines or significant importance to our strategic goals were placed at the top of the daily agenda. I also held weekly planning sessions with each project team to outline tasks, set short-term goals, and adjust plans as necessary. I made extensive use of project management tools to keep track of progress, deadlines, and resource allocation across all projects. This enabled me to maintain a clear overview and quickly reallocate resources as needed to address any bottlenecks or delays. Furthermore, I maintained open lines of communication with all stakeholders, providing regular updates and managing expectations. This not only ensured that everyone was informed but also allowed me to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments in real-time. Finally, I delegated tasks strategically, capitalizing on the strengths of my team members. This not only ensured tasks were completed efficiently but also kept the team engaged and motivated.\\" **Result:** \\"Through careful planning, prioritization, and communication, all three projects were completed successfully by the deadlines. Two were delivered under budget, and all received positive feedback from stakeholders for meeting the desired quality standards.

Though this is a fictional example, feel free to adapt and use elements from your own experiences. --- \\"In my previous role as a Project Coordinator, we encountered a challenging situation when midway through a critical project, a key team member unexpectedly had to take an extended leave due to a family emergency. This individual was leading a central component of the project, and their sudden absence put the project\'s deadline at risk. The situation was challenging not only because of the tight timeline but also due to the specialized knowledge required, which was unique to this team member. First, I assessed the situation by determining how the absence would impact our timeline and deliverables. After understanding the full scope of the impact, I convened a meeting with the project team to brainstorm potential solutions. It was imperative to foster an environment where all ideas were welcome, as collaboration would be key to navigating through this unexpected challenge. Recognizing the urgency to find a replacement or redistribute the workload, I proposed a two-pronged approach to the team and upper management: 1. **Internal Resource Reallocation:** I identified team members who, with some additional training, could temporarily take over some of the key tasks. This involved reallocating our resources efficiently and providing quick, targeted training sessions to upskill these team members. 2. **External Expert Consultation:** Understanding that some highly specialized tasks required expertise we couldn\'t quickly develop internally, I recommended bringing in an external consultant who had the necessary background. To implement this solution, I coordinated with HR to expedite the onboarding process for the consultant, and I organized a series of knowledge transfer sessions between the consultant, myself, and available team members. Simultaneously, I adjusted our project timeline and communicated the changes and reasons behind them to all stakeholders transparently, ensuring they were aware of our proactive steps to mitigate risk. This approach not only helped us to maintain momentum on critical parts of the project but also built a stronger sense of team unity and resilience. We successfully met the project deadline and received commendable feedback from stakeholders on our adaptability and commitment to quality. Furthermore, this experience improved our team\'s capability to quickly adapt to changes and enhanced our contingency planning strategies for future projects. The situation was undoubtedly challenging, but it reinforced the importance of flexibility, rapid problem-solving, and open communication within professional settings. It was a testament to how collaborative efforts and strategic thinking can turn obstacles into opportunities for growth and learning.\\" --- This response illustrates your capacity to manage crises, leverage team strengths, and communicate effectively with stakeholders, all of which are valuable traits in a professional setting.

Here\'s how you might approach answering this question, showcasing your communication, adaptability, and interpersonal skills: --- \\"In my experience, working with a diverse range of stakeholders—be it volunteers, donors, or community members—requires a multifaceted approach centered on effective communication, empathy, and strategic engagement. Firstly, understanding the unique perspectives and motivations of each stakeholder group is crucial. With volunteers, for example, recognizing their personal commitment and the value they bring to the table is key. I make it a point to engage with them by acknowledging their contributions, understanding their skills and interests, and matching them with tasks that are both meaningful and satisfying. This not only enhances their experience but also maximizes the impact of their work. When it comes to donors, transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. I ensure clear and consistent communication about how their contributions are being utilized and the difference they are making. Tailoring updates and reports to reflect the specific interests or concerns of each donor strengthens the relationship and fosters continued support. For community members, who are often the direct beneficiaries of projects or initiatives, I prioritize listening and inclusivity. This involves holding forums or meetings where they can openly share their needs, concerns, and feedback. It\'s about building trust through genuine engagement and showing that their input directly influences project outcomes. This approach not only empowers the community but also ensures the initiatives we undertake are truly beneficial and sustainable. Across all stakeholder interactions, I adapt my communication style and methods to suit the audience—whether that\'s formal presentations for donors, collaborative meetings with volunteers, or community workshops. I also leverage various channels, from emails and newsletters to social media and face-to-face meetings, to keep everyone informed and engaged. In terms of challenges, differing viewpoints and interests can sometimes lead to conflicts. In such cases, I employ active listening, negotiation, and sometimes mediation techniques to find common ground and mutually beneficial solutions. It\'s about respecting each stakeholder\'s contribution and perspective while keeping the project\'s goals front and center. Ultimately, my approach is built on the foundation of respect, genuine engagement, and the belief that every stakeholder brings value. By fostering open communication, adapting to diverse needs, and ensuring inclusivity, I\'ve been able to successfully navigate and leverage the richness that comes from working with a broad range of stakeholders.\\" --- This answer demonstrates not just your strategies for dealing with a diverse stakeholder base but also your ability to lead with empathy, adaptability, and strategic communication—all critical skills in stakeholder management.

Here’s how you might answer this question tailored for a Project Officer role, emphasizing problem-solving, strategic thinking, and effective communication: --- \\"Absolutely, a memorable problem occurred during a community development project I was overseeing as a Project Officer. The project aimed to improve local water access in a rural area, but halfway through, we encountered an unexpected legal hurdle. A segment of the new pipeline crossed a piece of land whose ownership was under dispute, and construction had to be halted until it was resolved. This posed a significant risk to the project timeline and threatened to delay benefits for the community relying on this essential improvement. **Assessment and Strategy Development:** The first step I took was to thoroughly understand the legal dispute by engaging with our legal team, external legal counsel specialized in land rights, and the local authorities. It was crucial to grasp the nuances of the issue to navigate it effectively. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Recognizing the importance of clear and transparent communication, I organized a series of meetings with the affected community, local government officials, and the disputing landowners. The goal was to facilitate an open dialogue, outline how the delay impacted the community, and explore any potential for a temporary agreement or easement that would allow the project to proceed. **Alternative Planning:** Parallelly, I worked with the engineering and planning teams to devise an alternative route for the pipeline that would bypass the disputed land entirely as a contingency plan. This required quick re-assessment of costs, environmental impact, and feasibility to ensure it was a viable option. **Negotiation and Mediation:** Through several rounds of negotiation, where we emphasized the community benefits and negotiated terms satisfying to all parties involved, we managed to secure a temporary easement agreement that allowed construction to resume while the legal dispute was being resolved independently. **Implementation and Monitoring:** With the green light obtained, I coordinated closely with the construction team to expedite work on the critical segment of the pipeline and closely monitored progress to ensure the new timeline was met without further issues. **Outcome:** The project was successfully completed with a slight delay but well within the contingency time and budget we had allocated for unexpected challenges. The community gained access to the much-needed water supply, and the dispute was eventually resolved without impacting the project further. This experience highlighted the importance of being prepared for unforeseen challenges, the value of clear communication with all stakeholders, and the need for strategic thinking to navigate complex issues. It also reinforced my belief in the power of negotiation and finding common ground to achieve a positive outcome for all involved.\\" --- This example showcases problem-solving skills, the ability to navigate complex issues with a strategic approach, and the importance of stakeholder engagement, which are all key competencies for a Project Officer role.

Der ganze Rotationsstreit kreiste und kreist um dieses subjektive Problem. Das theoretisch-revolutionäre Erkenntnisinteresse (Kritik der Politik) muß dem materiellen Interesse (Politik als Beruf) den Platz räumen. Von da aus ist es nur - für alle Politiker - ein kleiner Schritt, seine Funktionalität umzuinterpretieren und zur politischen „Autonomie“ werden zu lassen: Autonomie des Politikers gegenüber der Gesellschaft und den Gruppen, die ihn in die Institution hineingeschickt haben. „Die Arbeiterpartei ist gegenüber der Arbeiterklasse autonom“ - so Tronti, nicht der heutige noch der frühere, sondern der mittlere. Ich warte nicht ohne Spannung auf den Zeitpunkt, an dem irgendeine grüne Fraktion diese spezifische Autonomie entdecken und sie über alle Basis-Rückbindung stellen wird. Wer sich in die Institutio-nen begibt, kommt also darin keineswegs um; verliert seine Identität nicht, sondern gewinnt eine neue, in der er sich prächtig gefällt und mächtig gedeiht - wenn es möglich ist, bis zur Ministeriabilität. Er stabilisiert das politische Leben: sein eigenes und im Sinne des Verfassungseides auch das Leben der Nation. Nicht, daß damit der ursprüngliche Auftrag restlos verloren ginge. Der alte sozialdemokratische Traum wiederholt sich vielmehr, gewinnt neue Formen und Inhalte; kehrt aber in die bürgerliche Fassung des Prinzips Hoffnung zurück: die Institutionen von innen her zu reformieren. Die Hoffnung verdiente Anerkennung, sogar Zustimmung, gäbe es den geschichtlich bestätigten Verdacht nicht, daß es sich dabei nur um die hoffnungslose Perspektive handelt, Reformen in die Strategie der Aufrechterhaltung des Bestehenden einzubringen. Die Rechte freut sich immer, wenn die Linke die Aufgabe übernimmt - wie oben gesagt -, Zustände so zu ändern, daß das Gute, Alte, Wahre dabei nicht gefährdet wird. Die Hoffnung klemmt sich ein zwischen die Absicht und den guten Willen, verfassungskonforme Einbindung und Eindämmung alternativ-emanzipatorisch zu gebrauchen und die Funktion der Institutionen, alles Emanzipatorische einzubinden und einzudämmen. Derart versucht die neue Fassung der gesellschaftlich-politischen Opposition, um bei ihrem Sprachgebrauch zu bleiben, Entlaubungsmittel zur Rettung des deutschen Waldes einzusetzen. Dazu gehörte die Neuentdeckung der „wahren“ Volksvertretung und des verfassungsmäßigen Auftrags des Parlaments. Über die sogenannte Zentralität des Parlaments braucht man sich nicht noch einmal zu äußern. Beachtenswerter sind die Probleme, die sich daraus für eine alternative Opposition ergeben - Alltagsprobleme, die allerdings alle Strategie und Hoffnung zuweilen verschlucken. Zunächst läßt sich beobachten, daß der größte Teil der politischen Energie der neuen Opposition verwendet und verschwendet wird, nicht um Fragen der Entscheidungen und der Veränderungen in der Politik, sondern um das jeweilige parlamentarische Verhalten zu klären. In Bonn wie auch in Wiesbaden. Dabei verstrickt sich die neue Opposition in einen eigentümlichen, das heißt ihr eigenen Widerspruch, der klar zeigt, daß sie die Logik der Institutionen nicht begriffen und daher sich ihr unterworfen hat - und zwar bewußtlos. Im Zusammenhang mit der Frie-densbewegung wurde von ihr häufig und zu Recht das Argu-ment angeführt, eine in einer anders gearteten Situation, daher zufällig zustandegekommene Bundestagsmehrheit könne nicht über Schicksalsfragen des ganzen Volkes entscheiden. Das Argument ist richtig. Es läuft auf’s Plebiszit hinaus und erkennt durchaus die Perversität der bekannten Parole: „Lieber tot als rot“. Außerhalb des Plebiszits möge dies eine jede Person für sich selbst klären - und dann eben Selbstmord begehen, doch nicht Millionen zum Tode zwingen. Zugleich aber möchten die Grünen parlamentarische Entscheidungen über solche Fragen herbeiführen. Sie verfahren also regelgemäß und streben die Bildung von Mehrheiten an (Hessen); sie beteiligen sich an Mehrheitsentscheidungen (zum Beispiel in der läppischen Frage der Vergabe eines Fußball-Europaspiels nach Berlin) und freuen sich ehrlich, wenn irgendein CDU-Minister ihnen bestätigt, in dieser oder jener Frage „mit der Mehrheit abgestimmt“, sich also gemeinwohl- und verfassungskonform verhalten zu haben. Dies alles hat aber mit der von Hirsch angedeuteten „Macht-eroberung“ mindestens zur Zeit sehr wenig zu tun. Die Faszi-nation, die die staatlichen Institutionen auf die neue Opposition ausüben, fällt nicht mit einem, gleichwie gearteten Machttrieb zusammen - Machttrieb, dies sei vorsichtshalber erwähnt, im engen politischen, nicht im präzisen psychoanalytischen Sinn verstanden. Zumindest kollektiv: in der Partei und in der Fraktion der Grünen, fällt dergleichen nicht auf. Eher pflegen sie mit der Ohnmacht, genauer mit der institutionellen Ohnmacht zu kokettieren und aus der moralischen Kraft, die sich aus solcher Ohnmacht ergibt: sie verträten zwar die Interessen des ganzen Volks; institutionell habe sich dies aber noch nicht in Parlamentsmehrheit oder in Koalitionsnotwendigkeit umschlagen lassen. Individuell läßt sich die Lage kaum klären. Die Grünen im Bundestag sind jederzeit für eine scharfe Debatte, für Denunziationen von Machtmißbrauch, gelegentlich - wenn auch mit Bauchschmerzen - für eine Regelverletzung zu haben. Sie entwickeln darin sogar eine gewisse Meisterschaft, die sich günstig in die Aufwertung der Institution einbringen läßt. Wer von uns freut sich nicht über grüne Ein- und Ausfälle im Bun-destag. Nur sind einige Autoren von dem Schauspiel so fasziniert (das ist die Wahlbürger-Seite der Faszination), daß sie schon von einer, durch solche Ein- und Ausfälle bewirkten „Politisierung“ des Parlaments, genauer: des Bundestags sprechen - eine törichte Vorstellung, daß ausgerechnet das normativ als Zentrum der Politik gefeierte Organ „politisiert“ werden müsse oder könne. Vom Kern des Politischen, von seiner subjektiven Überset-zung ins „Streben nach Macht“ oder „Machteroberung“ ist bei der grünen Opposition kollektiv (und vorläufig) wenig zu spüren. Keine Grüne und kein Grüner tragen deutlich den inhaltlosen „Willen zur Macht“ so zur Schau, wie etwa der jetzige Bundeskanzler. Fällt zuweilen einem Journalisten Petra Kelly ein, so gerät der Einfall schief. Petra Kelly ist die deutsche Fassung des italienischen Radikalen Pannella: Pannella will weder Macht erobern noch Macht in die Knie zwingen. Er will Schlagzeilen machen oder - freundlich gewendet - die Öffentlichkeit mobilisieren. Ruhmsucht deckt sich aber nicht immer und nicht überall mit Machtsucht oder Machtwille. „Cantici di gloria son cantici d’amore“, sang man früher in goliardischen Zirkeln [“Ruhmesgesänge sind Gesänge der Liebe“ (Goliardi- sche Zirkel sind studentische Verbindungen)]. Freilich ist Liebe auch eine Macht. Das Problem liegt auf einer anderen Ebene, ist - wie man heute wissenschaftlich zu sagen pflegt - komplexer und komplizierter. Die grüne Opposition hat die Verfassung, von der sie annahm, sie sei nur das Grundgesetz einer verfestigten Gesellschaft, als Mittel der Emanzipation entdeckt. Damit ist schon ein Teil des alternativen Anspruchs aufgegeben, doch eine andere Gesellschaft anzustreben, die konsequenterweise auch sich anders verfassen lassen muß: sich eine andere, nicht mehr politische Organisation geben soll. Die Herrschafts-funktion der bürgerlichen Verfassung gerät aus den Augen, da gerade die Verfassungsinstitutionen den Grünen die Möglich-keit geben, Nonkonformismus und Alternative - wenn auch nur formal - auszusprechen und ein Stück Protest und Regel-verletzung in eine polizeilich nicht verfolgbare Artikulation zu übersetzen. Die Grünen, zum Teil ohnehin emotional ge-stimmt, übersehen, daß sie dadurch Gefahr laufen, sich selber zu transformieren: in einen unbewußten Stabilitäts- und Herrschaftsfaktor - bewußtlose Macht, die ihre Freude an der friedlichen, dennoch harten Form parlamentarisch-gouvernementa- ler Auseinandersetzungen hat und deren Eigenschaft nicht begreift, „Schattenboxen“5 zu sein. ”翻译为中文","output":"谁通过进入国家决策机构而成为了有身份的人，而不再是通常意义上与机构进行抽象斗争的人；通过政治活动而非对政治的批评成名的人，会失去改变和废除机构的兴趣——除非，他想利用这些机构再次成为某个人。整个轮换争议围绕这一主观问题旋转。理论上的革命性认识兴趣（对政治的批评）必须给予物质利益（以政治为职业）让步。从这里出发，对于所有政治家来说，将自己的功能性重新解释为政治“自主性”只是一小步：政治家相对于社会和派遣他们进入机构的团体的自主性。“工人党对工人阶级具有自主性”——特罗提如是说，不是今天的，也不是以前的，而是中期的特罗提。我对于任何一个绿党派系何时发现并将这种特定的自主性置于所有基础联系之上的时刻充满了期待。因此，进入机构的人并非在其中丧失自我；反而是获得了一个他们非常喜欢并能够在其中茁壮成长的新身份——如果可能，直至具备成为部长的资格。他稳定了政治生活：他自己的，也是按照宪法宣誓意义上的国家生活。这并不意味着最初的任务就此完全丢失。相反，老式的社民党梦想反而重现，获得了新的形式和内容；但又回归到希望原则的资产阶级版本：从内部改革机构。如果没有经历证实的怀疑，即这只是将改革带入维持现状战略的绝望视角，这种希望值得认可，甚至支持。右翼总是乐见左翼承担这样的任务——正如上文所说——以改变状态，同时不危害那些好的、古老的、真实的价值。 希望夹在意图和善意之间，试图用符合宪法的整合和约束以替代性解放的手段，以及机构的功能，将所有的解放性内容都整合和约束起来。为了维持自己的语言使用，这样新版本的社会政治反对派尝试使用除叶剂来拯救德国森林。这包括重新发现“真正”的人民代表和议会的宪法任务。“议会中心论”无需再次讨论。更值得注意的是，这为替代性反对派带来了一些问题——日常问题，这些问题时而吞没了所有的策略和希望。首先，可以观察到，新的反对派将大部分政治能量用于和浪费在，不是决策和政治变革上，而是澄清各自在议会中的行为问题上。无论是在波恩还是在维斯巴登都是如此。与此同时，新的反对派陷入了一种特有的矛盾之中，清楚地表明他们没有理解机构的逻辑，因而无意识地屈服于它。在和平运动的背景下，常常且正确地提出一个论点，即在一个不同的、因此是偶然的情况下形成的联邦议会多数不能决定整个国家的命运问题。这个论点是正确的。它通向全民投票，并完全认识到“宁死不红”的著名口号的反常。除了全民投票之外，每个人都可以为自己解决这个问题——然后就是自杀，但不是迫使数百万人死亡。然而，绿党想通过议会决定来处理这些问题。因此，他们按规则行事，追求多数派的形成（例如在黑森州）；它们参与多数决定（例如在将某次欧洲足球比赛授予柏林的琐碎问题上）并且当某位基民盟部长确认他们在这个或那个问题上“与多数一致投票”时，他们真诚地感到高兴，表现出是为公共利益和宪法遵从而行动。但所有这些与赫希提到的“权力掌握”至少在当前几乎没有太大联系。绿党对国家机构的迷恋并不与任何类型的权力欲相符——权力欲，为慎重起见，以狭义的政治意义而非精确的心理分析意义来理解。至少在集体上，在绿党和绿党团体中，没看到这种情况。他们更倾向于以无力，具体来说是以机构无力作秀，并从这样的无力中获得道德力量：他们虽然代表了全民的利益；机构上这还没有转化为议会多数或联盟必要性。个体情况几乎无法澄清。在联邦议会中的绿党人随时准备进行激烈的辩论，揭露滥用权力，偶尔——尽管心有不甘——违反规则。他们甚至在此方面发展出了一定的技能，这有助于升值该机构的作用。我们中的谁不高兴看到绿党在联邦议会的进进出出。只是一些作者被这场表演迷住了（这是选民对该迷恋的看法），他们甚至开始谈论由于这些进出表现而导致的议会，“更确切地说是联邦议会的政治化”——一个愚蠢的想法，即正是作为政治中心被赞颂的机构需要或能够被“政治化”。 就政治的核心，就其转化为“追求权力”或“权力掌控”的主观表现来说，从集体上（且暂时地）看，绿党反对派表现出很少的迹象。没有一个绿党人像现任联邦总理那样明显地展现出无实质内容的“权力意志”。偶尔当某位记者想起佩特拉·凯利时，这种想法就变得扭曲了。佩特拉·凯利是意大利激进分子潘内拉的德国版本：潘内拉既不想要征服权力，也不想要制服权力。他想要制造头条新闻或者——用更友好的方式说——动员公众。但是，名声欲望并不总是与权力欲或权力意志匹配。如同过去在学生圈中唱的，“荣耀之歌是爱之歌”。当然，爱也是一种力量。问题在于其他层面，是——如同今天科学上常说的——更加复杂和复杂化。绿党反对派已经发现了宪法，他们原以为它只是一个固化社会的基本法， 作为解放的手段。这已部分放弃了其替代性主张，即追求一个不同的社会，这个社会从逻辑上也必须以不同的方式构建：赋予自己一种不同的、不再是政治性的组织。资产阶级宪法的统治功能被忽视了，因为正是宪法机构给予了绿党非传统和替代性的机会——尽管只是形式上——来表达和将一部分抗议和规则违反转化为不会受到警察追究的表达形式。绿党，部分因情感驱动，忽视了通过这种方式，他们面临着转变为一个无意识的稳定性和统治因素的风险：一种无意识的权力，它在和平但仍然激烈的议会-政府冲突中找到乐趣，而不理解其特性是“影子拳击”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Und resultiert einmal aus dem Schattenboxen gar die Schließung eines Atomkraftwerks, so erfahren sie unvermittelt, daß sich die Verfassung als Instrument einer am Guten orientierbaren Herrschaft gebrauchen läßt - eine späte Variante des „alternativen Gebrauchs des Rechts“, der Anfang der 70er Jahre die italienischen Kommunisten ins Schwärmen brachte. Bei dieser unvermittelten Erfahrung bleiben sie stehen, erwärmen sich daran wie an einer südländischen Frühlingssonne. Sie vergessen dabei, daß sie in Mitteleuropa leben, in einer weitaus kälteren, aber auch effizienteren politischen Kultur und fragen weder sich noch die anderen, ob der erreichte Erfolg sich auf ganz anders geartete Gründe zurückführen ließe als auf ihren Kraft- und Oppositionsakt: auf ökonomische Erwägungen, auf gesellschaftsplanerische Erfordernisse, auf eine nicht durchschaute politische Strategie. Immerhin: Mancher meint, der Eintritt einer Handvoll unbotmäßiger Gestalten in die Politik könne den Involu-tionsprozeß des bürgerlichen Staats mit den institutionellen Mitteln eben dieses Staats unterbrechen oder gar umkehren. Unerfreulich war dieser Eintritt keineswegs. Wer von uns hat sich nicht über die erste grüne Periode des Bundestags gefreut - auch wenn dabei die Bauchschmerzen nicht ausblieben, da ganz offensichtlich ein Institut aufgewertet wurde und eine Bedeutung bekam, die ihm politisch gar nicht zustand. Die Illusion der „Zentralität des Parlaments“ bekam neue Nahrung. Als dann mit Hilfe der grünen Fraktion und einer wach gewordenen, zum Teil aber erst durch die grünen und sonstigen alternativen Bewegungen wach gerüttelten bürgerlichen Öffentlichkeit der oben erwähnte Untersuchungsausschuß mit seiner Arbeit begann, der Deckel hochging und die unangenehmen Gerüche aus dem Geldtopf der westdeutschen politischen Klasse aufstiegen, fand das demokratische Frohlocken kein Ende. Schien kein Ende nehmen zu müssen. Es steht - auch für mich - außer Zweifel, daß ohne die Grünen und ohne Otto Schily die lange Reihe der Bonner Finanzierungsskandale zumindest im Halbdunkel eines parlamentarischen Abschlußberichts geblieben wäre. Otto Schily, ein homo humanus von seltener Intelligenz und Geradheit, riß das Feigenblatt vor der Schamlosigkeit der politischen Klasse herunter und trug erheblich dazu bei, daß ein so genannter „Mächtiger“ (in Wirklichkeit eine Null) gestürzt wurde. Damit war aber auch alles zuende. Barzel wurde zum Waschmittel: Durch seinen quälenden Abgang machte er alle anderen wieder sauber, ebenso wie die Art und Weise, wie der Untersuchungsausschuß arbeitete, dem Staat die verloren gegangene Glaubwürdigkeit zurückgab. Die Politik hatte den Nachweis erbracht, daß sie sich selbst kon-trollieren und beschränken kann. Und Otto Schily wurde der-art - und sicherlich ungerechterweise - zum Symbol der doch im Grunde gesunden Verfassung. Das System der Herrschaft versuchte, sich ein neues Feigenblatt zuzulegen. Exemplarisch wurde in diesem Fall vorgeführt, daß die Institutionen mäch-tiger sind als der Wille der Grünen, sie alternativ zu gebrau-chen. Sie gingen aus der Krise gestärkt hervor. Einige Vertreter der Grünen haben wahrscheinlich genau dies intendiert. Für die anderen zeigt das Beispiel, was es heißt, in der Beurteilung der Institutionen und in dem Verhalten innerhalb einer politi-schen Klasse, in die man sich kraft Wahl eingeschlichen hat, bei der unmittelbaren und beglückenden Erfahrung zu bleiben, man sei da und habe Erfolg und werde beachtet; und die bloße Präsenz in der Politik für das Wesentliche zu halten. Kein Machtstreben also. Verblendet werden die Neuentdek- ker der Vorzüge eines parlamentarischen Systems (die übrigens von niemandem bestritten werden, nur die Frage des cui bono wird jeweils anders beantwortet) nicht durch die Faszination der Staatsmacht, sondern durch deren Konstitutionalisierung. Dies mag auch gnoseologische Gründe haben. Da sie theoretisch aufs Gefühl, praktisch auf die Emotion, auf die „unmittelbare Betroffenheit“ setzen, ziehen sie aus dem Umstand, daß sie sich in den Institutionen wohl fühlen, die Schlußfolgerung, erstens, daß letztere gut seien und zweitens, daß man mit ihnen nach Belieben umgehen könne. Sie erfühlen förmlich die Institutionen als wohltuend - im wörtlichen Sinne: als Mittel, das Wohl zu tun. Die Logik der Verfassung, zweckrational zur Herrschaft zu sein, läßt sich aber nicht erfühlen, sondern nur rational begreifen. Daher auch ihre Widersprüchlichkeit. Einerseits verhalten sie sich als der radikalere, aber in die Institutio- nalität eingefügte Stachel der Opposition; oder als der StachelPartner einer sozialdemokratischen Mehrheit; oder - wie einige von ihnen vorschlagen - einer konservativen Mehrheit, genau so, wie eine konforme, akkumulationsadäquate und staatssta-bilisierende oppositionelle Gruppe sich seit jeher verhält. Sie richten sich - wenn die Selbstironisierung gestattet wird - nach den Maßgaben der Transformation der Demokratie, denn sie tun genau das, was in der Transformation der Demokratie der „Opposition seiner Majestät“, als einem Bestandteil der politischen Klasse vorbehalten wird. Insofern machen sie aus der ehemaligen „Bibel der APO“ den Knigge des innerparlamentarischen Benehmens und der Präsenz in der großen Staatspolitik. Habent suam fortunam libelli.6 Auf der anderen, hoffnungsvolleren Seite unterscheiden sich die Grünen im Parlament wesentlich von der systemkonformen Opposition, entsprechen dem Projekt einer fundamentalen Opposition und richten sich also auch nach der negativen Seite der Transformation der Demokratie\'. Zur „Repräsentation der Herrschaft“ gehören sie - zumindest in Bonn, anderswo ist es anders - auf keinen Fall, auch wenn sie sich auf das Spiel der wechselnden Mehrheitsentscheidungen eingelassen haben. Das gilt zumindest für einen, immer noch beträchtlichen Teil der Fraktion und der Partei - wobei ich nicht an die Bahro-Fun- damentalisten denke, die eher auf eine Gegen-Elite aus sind (im Sinne von Pareto, mit Kraushaars Erlaubnis) und deren Maßstäbe von jeder Art Rationalität frei gehalten werden. Wer zur negativen Seite des institutionellen Lebens gehört, befindet sich (bei den Grünen) in der widersprüchlichen Position, sich der Repräsentation der Herrschaft zu entziehen, zugleich aber die Beherrschten, die „Regierten“, keineswegs allesamt zu vertreten. Andererseits treten sie bewußt für die Rechte der Minderheiten ein und verstehen sich - wenn schon - als Repräsentation der Minderheiten, der unterdrückten, verachteten, mißhandelten Randgruppen der Gesellschaft. Übersehen wird dabei das inhaltliche Problem, das in einer klassenmäßigen Perspektive gar keine Schwierigkeiten bereiten würde: Die jetzt Herrschenden sind nämlich eine Minderheit, von der die Mehrheit wünschen könnte oder sollte, sie möge sich endlich wenn nicht zum Teufel, so doch in die Machtlosigkeit scheren. Wenn die von den Grünen vertretenen Minderheiten das Sagen erobern (die Macht, von der Joachim Hirsch spricht), werden die anderen zu Minderheiten - die wieder von den Grünen vertreten werden? Das institutionelle Leben kennt eben einige Tük- ken, die alle ihren strategischen Sinn haben. Sagen die Grünen aber über sich und von sich, sie verträten doch die Beherrschten, so wäre dies die Anmaßung, substitutiv für die „wahren“, von den Massen nicht richtig verstandenen Interessen der Massen zu sein.7 Von der erwähnten Anmaßung bis zum Avantgarde-Anspruch ist der Weg nicht weit und von da aus bis zurück in die Repräsentation der Herrschaft fehlen nur noch wenige Schritte: Die Vertreter einer Avantgarde in einem bürgerlichen Parlament melden bald den anderen Anspruch an, an der Macht beteiligt zu werden oder sie zu erobern. Darin mag Hirsch durchaus Recht haben - vorausgesetzt, die Grünen verstünden sich tatsächlich als Avantgarde einer die ganze Nation über alle Klassen hinweg rettenden Bewegung - oder Organisation: also doch als Elite, die die jeweils richtigere Entscheidung zu treffen weiß. Die politische Bedeutung, der Sinn (und damit das Wichtigste für ihre eigene Strategie) kann aber - so will es mir scheinen - nur darin liegen, als disfunktionaler Stachel zu handeln, der bewußt destabilisieren und - poetisch gesprochen - ganz eindeutig neue Ufer ansteuern will; wie etwa die Radikale Partei (bis vor kurzem) und die Democrazia proletaria (vorläufig immer noch) in Italien. Freilich lockt die Ministeriabilität auch in diesen Gruppen sehr dazu, die Disfunktionalität zu leugnen und sich als Einbringer des Dissenses in den allgemeinen Konsens zu betätigen.”翻译为中文","output":"如果从“影子拳击”中真的导致了关闭一座核电站，他们突然发现，宪法可以作为一种以善为导向的统治工具——这是对70年代初意大利共产党人着迷于“法律的替代性使用”的晚期变种的体验。在这种突如其来的经历中，他们停留下来，就像沐浴在南方春天的阳光中一样温暖。他们忘记了自己生活在中欧，一个远冷酷但也更有效的政治文化中，并没有问自己或他们人，所达到的成功是否可以归因于与他们的努力和反对行为完全不同的原因：经济考量、社会规划需求、或一种没有被理解的政治策略。毕竟，有人认为，少数不驯之士进入政治，可以使用这个资产阶级国家的机制来中断甚至逆转资产阶级国家的内部蜕变过程。 这种加入一点也不讨厌。我们当中谁不为联邦议会的第一个绿党时期感到高兴——尽管这激起了一些不适，因为很明显一个机构被提升了价值，一个在政治上根本不属于它的重要性。\\"议会中心论\\"得到了新的滋养。然后，在绿党团体的帮助下，以及一部分通过绿党和其他替代性运动唤醒的资产阶级公众，上述调查委员会开始了它的工作，揭开了盖子，让西德政治阶层的金钱罐散发出的令人不快的气味散发出来，民主的喜悦没有尽头。看似不必有尽头。毫无疑问，没有绿党和奥托·希利，邦恩的一系列财务丑闻至少会留在一个议会调查报告的半黑暗中。奥托·希利，一个智力和正直极为罕见的人，揭开了政治阶级无耻的遮羞布，并大大促进了一位所谓的“有权者”（实际上是个空虚的人）的倒台。但那也就是全部了。巴泽尔变成了洗涤剂：通过他痛苦的离场，他清洗了其他所有人，就像调查委员会的工作方式一样，让国家重新获得了失去的信誉。政治已经证明了它能够自我控制和限制。奥托·希利因此——而且肯定是不公平地——成为了基本健康的宪法的象征。统治系统试图给自己加上一个新的遮羞布。在这个例子中，典型地展示了，机构比绿党人想要以替代性方式使用它们的意愿更强大。它们从危机中更加强大地走出来了。一些绿党的代表可能正是这样打算的。对于其他人来说，这个例子展示了，停留在立即的、令人高兴的经验中——即自己在场，成功并受到关注；并将政治中的单纯存在视为本质——在评价机构和在自己通过选举潜入的政治阶级内的行为中的含义。 所以，没有权力追求。新发现议会制度优点的人（顺便说一句，这些优点没有人否认，只是回答cui bono时会有所不同）被盲目的不是对国家权力的迷恋，而是对其宪政化。这也可能有认识论的原因。因为他们理论上依赖感觉，实践上依赖情绪，依赖“直接受影响”，所以他们得出结论，首先，机构是好的；其次，可以随意使用它们。他们几乎能感觉到机构是有益的——字面意义上：作为做好事的手段。但宪法的逻辑——目的合理化为统治——不能通过感觉来理解，而只能通过理性来理解。因此也是他们的矛盾。一方面，他们表现为更激进的，但融入机构中的反对派的刺激；或作为社会民主党多数派的刺激合作伙伴；或者——正如他们中的一些人建议的——作为保守多数派，就像一群合规的、积累适宜的、国家稳定的反对派组织始终以来的行为一样。如果允许自我讽刺，他们按照民主的转型的指示行事，因为他们正是按照民主转型中“国王的反对派”作为政治阶级一部分所预留的那样行事。在这个意义上，他们将曾经的“APO圣经”变成了议会内部行为和大国政策存在的准则手册。Habent suam fortunam libelli。 在另一方面，更有希望的是，议会中的绿党与体制内的反对派有着本质的不同，符合基本反对派的项目，因而也遵循着民主转型的负面面。他们绝不属于“统治的代表”，至少在波恩是这样，其他地方则不同，即使他们参与了不断变化的多数决定的游戏。至少对于党内和党团的一个仍然相当大的部分来说是这样——我在这里不是指追求反精英的Bahro基础主义者（按照帕累托的意义，有Kraushaar的允许）和他们的标准远离任何类型的理性。属于机构生活负面的人（在绿党中）处于一种矛盾的位置，他们避免成为统治的代表，但同时并不完全代表被统治者，即“被治理者”。另一方面，他们明确地支持少数族群的权利，并视自己——如果有的话——为被压迫、被蔑视、被虐待的社会边缘团体的代表。他们忽视了一个内容问题，这在一个阶级视角中根本不会构成困难：现在的统治者实际上是一个少数派，大多数人可能希望或应该希望他们最终如不是下地狱，至少是陷入无权的境地。如果被绿党代表的少数派夺取了话语权（赫希所说的权力），其他人会成为少数派——他们会再次被绿党代表吗？机构生活确实有一些狡猾，所有这些都有它们的战略意义。但是，如果绿党说他们代表了被统治者，那将是傲慢的，代替性地代表了“真正的”，由大众未能正确理解的利益。从这种傲慢到先锋队的要求只有一步之遥，从那里到重新回到统治的代表只差几步：作为资产阶级议会中的先锋队的代表们很快就会提出其他要求，要求参与权力或征服它。在这方面，赫希可能完全正确——假设绿党真的将自己视为跨越所有阶级拯救整个民族的运动或组织的先锋队：也就是说，作为能够做出正确决策的精英。 然而，政治意义、意图（因此对他们自己的战略来说是最重要的）只能在于，作为一个有意识的破坏性刺激，想要明确地导向新的方向；就像意大利的激进党（直到不久前）和无产阶级民主党（暂时仍然）那样。当然，在这些团体中，部长的资格也非常吸引人，以至于否认自己的功能失调，并充当异议者在一般共识中的引入者。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die westdeutsche Ideologie hat einen besonderen und besonders attraktiven, für die mitteleuropäische Kultur beinah unwiderstehlichen Lockvogel entdeckt, um die Grünen - wie es auch entsprechend heißt - in die Pflicht zu nehmen: die „politische Verantwortung“. Diese zeigt ein doppeltes Gesicht: ein moralisches und ein im richtigen Sinn politisches. Moralisch werden die Grünen aufgefordert, sich verantwortlich, das heißt schlicht: regelkonform und verfahrensfunktional zu verhalten. So werden sie jeweils belohnt, wenn ihr „Abstimmungsverhalten“ oder ihr allgemeines parlamentarisches Benehmen sich in dem vorgesehenen Rahmen hält: Sie hätten sich „verantwort-lich“ verhalten. Politisch hingegen bedeutet politische Verantwortung die Willigkeit, sie auch zu übernehmen, also bereit sein, zu regieren und sich in die Repräsentation der Herrschaft einzufügen. Mögen sich die Grünen entscheiden. Sie stehen - wiederum - vor dem gleichen Problem wie die Sozialdemokraten am Ende des vorigen Jahrhunderts: Dürfen sie in eine herzogliche Regierung eintreten, oder verraten sie damit die Klassentreue und den geschichtlichen Auftrag? Sie traten ein - mit den bekannten Folgen. Die Grünen verlören aber ihre geschichtliche und gesellschaftliche Bedeutung, auch wenn sie an Macht gewönnen, stellten sie sich auf die Seite der „Regierenden“ gegenüber den „Regierten“. Der Lockvogel der „politischen Verantwortung“ kommt übrigens nicht von irgendwo her; entspricht und entspringt vielmehr der Logik des bürgerlichen Denkens, dem es unbegreiflich bleibt, daß jemand sich aktiv mit der Politik beschäftigt, aber nicht „regieren“ will. Was wollen und sollen also die Grünen, was sollen sie wollen: politikfähig, koalitionsfähig, regierungsfähig werden; oder Orientierungspunkt, Organisationsmöglichkeit einer fundamentalen „Welle“ bleiben? Sie haben diese zwei Möglichkeiten deutlich vor sich - mit all den Widersprüchen, Unsicherheiten, möglichen Enttäuschungen (und Täuschungen), die in jeder Möglichkeit stecken: entweder durchgängige Alternative oder Koalitionspartner einer verfassungskonformen, herrschaftsbestimmten Alternanz werden, eines bloßen Regierungswechsels. Immerhin: Das gleiche Dilemma, vor dem Italiens kommunistische Partei steht. Am Ende kann einem doch Versöhnliches einfallen: nicht, daß ein Regierungswechsel als wirkliche Alternanz abzulehnen wäre. Es gibt in der Tat auch das geringere Übel, das zugleich Vorteile, die Möglichkeit eines freieren Atems - und die Illusion des sozialen Staats - mit sich bringt. Nur: Die Alternanz kehrt den Prozeß der Involution nicht um; gibt ihr nur das berühmte menschlichere Gesicht. Ist dies die einzige Aussicht, der einzige Ausweg: die Herrschaft mit menschlichem Gesicht? Ich komme am Ende noch einmal darauf zurück. Nachtrag zur institutionellen Strategie Eine Vorbemerkung: Wenn ich von institutioneller Strategie oder von einem bewußt eingeleiteten Involutionsprozeß rede, also von staatlicherseits vorgenommener Gesellschaftsplanung und einer bewußten Steuerung der Reproduktion, zum Beispiel von dem institutionell vorgenommenen Versuch, die Konflik- tualität von der Produktionsebene auf die Distributionsebene zu verlagern, so findet sich schnell der einschlägige Einwand: „Verschwörungstheorie“. Der Gegeneinwand ist nicht schwer. Erstens bedeutet bewußtes Handeln nicht willkürliches Han-deln - keine Schmittsche Velleität also; aber auch nicht politisch gewolltes, autonomes Handeln. Es ergibt sich vielmehr aus der Einsicht in die Notwendigkeit bestimmter politischer Maßnahmen um bestimmter gesellschaftlicher Ziele wegen - wenn man so will: aus einer Zweck-Mittel-Relation. Der ganze, groß angelegte und jämmerlich gescheiterte korporativistische Versuch der 30er Jahre in Italien ging genau darauf zurück, durch ent-sprechende institutionelle Reformen, Gesetze, Regeln, die Permanenz des Klassenkampfs in Italien zu brechen. Nicht das Scheitern ist dabei wichtig, sondern der Versuch einer Planung und Steuerung gesellschaftlicher Prozesse (Cassese nennt daher den italienischen Korporationsminister Giuseppe Bottai den „ersten großen Gesellschaftsplaner“ der Gegenwart). Zweitens, und abgesehen davon, daß die Verschwörungstheorie-Kritiker sich mindestens dem Anschein nach an die „Protokolle der Weisen von Zion“, also an eine Fälschung zu halten scheinen: „Verschwörung“ und Planung meinen zwei sehr verschiedene Dinge. Die Verschwörung - von Catilina über die Pazzi und Babeufs Gleiche bis zum 20. Juni - will bestehende Herrschaftsformen niederreißen, gerade herrschende Gruppen ablösen, ist auf Destruktion aus: wobei die Frage der Beurteilung eine Frage der Zielsetzung sein dürfte: Planung will bewahren und konstruieren oder rekonstruieren; sie geht von der Un-vermeidlichkeit kontrollierter Prozesse aus: Staatlich vorge-nommene, versuchte oder herbeigewünschte Gesellschaftsplanung dient der Reproduktion gegebener Strukturen, nicht der Destruktion. Mit dem Ausdruck „Verschwörung“ wird - mit anderen Worten - nichts begriffen, sondern salopp daneben gegriffen. Und schließlich geht es bei den „Verschwörungs“-vorwürfen um Seltsameres: Um den naiven Glauben, den man auch Orthodoxie nennt, es ließe sich in der gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung des Kapitalverhältnisses, der Klassenbewegung, der abhängigen Massen und der politischen Form gar nicht planen, da alles blind „nach dem Gesetz des Wertes“ (an dem ich in anderem Zusammenhang durchaus festhalte) vor sich ginge, ohne daß Subjekte sich verändernd, bestimmend, bedrängend dazwischen schalteten (oder schlicht - um Marx zu zitieren - „der Zufall“). Hinter diesem „Ökonomismus“, der sich für historischen Materialismus hält, steht die Fassungslosigkeit des Denkens vor der Wirklichkeit. Irgendwo bemerkt Bernhard Blanke, die von mir festgestellte und von ihm als Darstellung der Zustände akzeptierte Verlagerung von der Produktion auf die Distribution sei nicht „das Ergebnis bewußter Strategie, sondern Ergebnis der Verkehrung des Klassenverhältnisses in der Produktion von Wert und Mehrwert durch die entwickelte Oberfläche der Konkurrenz“8. Abgesehen von der seltenen Unfreiwilligkeit der Komik in diesem Satz und von der doch tiefen Einsicht, daß auch eine Oberfläche sich entwickelt: Sind Allendes Sturz, die Politik Reagans, „Kohls“ Tendenzwende, die englische Wirtschaftspolitik, Italiens periodische Schläge gegen die abhängigen Klassen zwecks Sanierung der Wirtschaft und der Staatsbilanz alle über die Entwicklung der Oberfläche der Konkurrenz und damit über den Markt gelaufen? Wenn dem so ist: Wozu braucht die kapitalistische Produktionsweise einen eigenen Staat? Daß Gesellschaftsplanung und institutionelle Strategie in den westlichen Gesellschaften, und nicht nur in diesen, ein erfreuliches Durcheinander bieten und nicht immer durchschlagen, bedeutet noch lange nicht, sie fänden nicht statt und alles ginge „naturwüchsig“ vor sich hin. Der „Sozialpakt“ (in England und Italien) entsteht nicht naturwüchsig aus den Marktgesetzen, stellt vielmehr den Versuch dar, den aus den Fugen geratenen Markt wieder in die eigene Gesetzlichkeit zurückzuführen: bewußter Eingriff in das Verhältnis Arbeit-Kapital, um dessen (kapitalistisch verstandene) „Naturwüchsigkeit“ und Normalität wiederherzustellen und den Arbeitsmarkt wieder akkumu-lationsgerecht zu regeln. Und den Textilunternehmern von Prato fiel die Wiedereinführung der massenhaften Heimarbeit auch nicht bewußtlos ein. Sie suchten und fanden einen, übrigens erfolgreichen, Ausweg, mit den Problemen der Konkurrenz und zugleich des Klassenkampfes fertig zu werden: seit der Verlagerung der Produktion in die „fabbrica diffusa“ [wörtlich: „zerstreute Fabrik“. Gemeint ist die Dezentralisierung und Verlagerung der Produktionseinheiten in Klein-, Mittel- und Heimproduktion] finden in Prato kaum noch Streiks statt; und der Export der Pratotextilien mit den geringen Produktionskosten ist gesichert. Übersetzt sich diese Strategie ins Politische und wird sie also institutionell, so bedeutet dies keineswegs, daß die Wirklichkeit anders wird und sie sich sozusagen wesentlich ins Staatliche begibt. Der Sozialpakt stammt nicht aus den Köpfen des Regierungspersonals, sondern aus den Vorschlägen der Unternehmer; und die „fabbrica diffusa“ wurde nicht in Roms Wirtschaftsministerium ausgedacht. Das Kapital kam selber dahinter. ”翻译为中文","output":"西德意识形态发现了一个特别有吸引力的诱饵，几乎对中欧文化不可抗拒，用以让绿党“承担责任”：即“政治责任”。这表现出双重面貌：道德上的和真正意义上的政治上的。道德上，绿党被要求表现出负责任，也就是说，简单地：遵守规则和程序功能。因此，当他们的“投票行为”或他们的一般议会行为保持在预期的框架内时，他们就会得到奖励：他们被认为是“负责任的”。而从政治上讲，政治责任意味着愿意承担责任，因此要准备好执政，并融入统治的代表。绿党愿随其选择。他们再次面临着与上个世纪末的社会民主党相同的问题：他们能进入一个公爵领导的政府吗，或者这样做是否意味着背叛了阶级忠诚和历史使命？他们加入了——众所周知的后果。即使绿党获得了权力，如果他们站在“统治者”对立于“被统治者”的一边，也会失去他们的历史和社会意义。“政治责任”的诱饵并非无中生有；更确切地说，它来源并符合资产阶级思维的逻辑，这种思维无法理解为何有人积极从事政治但不想“执政”。 那么绿党想要什么、应该要什么，应该想要什么：变得政治成熟、能够组成联盟、能够执政，还是成为一个根本性“浪潮”的导向点、组织机会？他们清楚地面临着这两种可能性——以及每一种可能性中固有的所有矛盾、不确定性、可能的失望（和欺骗）：要么成为一个全面的替代选择，要么成为宪法允许的、以统治为导向的轮换中的联盟伙伴，仅仅是政府更迭。毕竟，意大利共产党面临着同样的困境。 最终，人们还是会想到一种和解的想法：并不是说作为真正的替代选择的政府更迭应该被拒绝。事实上，也确实存在较小的恶，同时带来优势，可能性呼吸更自由——以及社会国家的幻想。只是，轮换并不逆转演化的过程；只是给它一个著名的更人性化的面孔。这是唯一的前景，唯一的出路吗：带着人性面孔的统治？我最后还会再谈到这一点。 对于体制战略的附加说明 首先要说明的是：当我谈论体制战略或是有意识地启动的演化过程，也就是说，由国家进行的社会规划和有意识的再生产控制，例如，通过体制努力将生产层面的冲突转移到分配层面的尝试，很快就会遇到一个相关的反驳：“阴谋论”。反驳并不难。首先，有意识的行动并不意味着任意行动——所以不是施密特式的随意性；但也不是政治意愿的自主行动。它更多地源于对某些政治措施的必要性的认识，为了达成某些社会目标——如果愿意的话：出于目的-手段的关系。在意大利30年代，整个宏大而又惨败的公司主义尝试，正是基于通过相应的体制改革、法律、规则来打破意大利的阶级斗争的持久性。重要的不是失败，而是规划和控制社会过程的尝试（Cassese因此称意大利的公司部长朱塞佩·博泰为当代“第一位伟大的社会规划者”）。其次，撇开“阴谋论”批评者似乎至少表面上依附于《锡安长老的议定书》这样的伪造物： “阴谋”和计划意味着两件非常不同的事情。阴谋——从卡提琳娜到帕齐和巴贝夫的平等者一直到6月20日——旨在推翻现有的统治形式，替换正处于权力的团体，目的在于破坏：其中评价的问题可能是目标设置的问题：计划意味着保持并建造或重建；它出发于控制过程不可避免的前提：国家进行的、尝试的或期望的社会规划服务于再生产既有结构，而非破坏。换句话说，使用“阴谋”一词——并没有理解任何事情，而是随意地搞错了。最后，关于“阴谋”的指责关乎于更奇怪的事情：关乎于那种也被称为正统的天真信仰，认为在资本关系的社会发展、阶级运动、依赖群众和政治形式中，根本无法计划，因为一切都是盲目地“按价值法则”运行（在其他情况下我确实坚持这一点），没有主体介入造成变化、决定和压迫（或简单地引用马克思的话说——“偶然性”）。这种“经济主义”，自认为是历史唯物主义，实际上是思想面对现实的困惑。伯恩哈德·布兰克在某处指出，我所发现并且他作为状态描述接受的从生产到分配的转移，并不是“有意策略的结果，而是生产中的阶级关系在价值和剩余价值生产中通过发达的竞争表面的逆转的结果”。撇开这句话中不经意的喜剧性和深入的洞察即使是表面也能发展之外：阿连德的倒台、里根的政策、“科尔”的趋势转变、英国的经济政策、意大利对依赖阶级的周期性打击以促进经济和国家财政的平衡都是通过竞争的表面和市场进行的吗？如果是这样的话：资本主义生产方式为什么需要一个自己的国家？ 社会规划和体制战略在西方社会中提供了一个令人愉快的混乱，并不总是成功，这并不意味着它们不存在，或一切都是“自然发展”的。\\"社会契约\\"（在英国和意大利）不是从市场法则中自然产生的，而是试图将脱轨的市场重新引入其固有的法则中：对劳资关系进行有意识的干预，以恢复其（资本主义理解的）“自然发展”和正常状态，并使劳动市场重新适应积累。普拉托的纺织企业家们也不是无意识地重新引入了大规模的家庭工作。他们寻找并找到了一种成功的方式，来应对竞争问题和阶级斗争问题：自从生产转移到“fabbrica diffusa” [直译为“分散工厂”。指的是生产单位分散化和转移到小型、中型和家庭生产中]以来，普拉托几乎没有发生过罢工；并且以低生产成本的普拉托纺织品出口得到了保障。 当这种战略转化为政治并因此成为体制化时，这并不意味着现实会变得不同，它基本上转向国家层面。社会契约不是来自政府人员的头脑，而是企业家的建议；“fabbrica diffusa”并非在罗马的经济部拟定。是资本自己想到了这一点。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die Bedingungen der institutionellen Strategie und die Bedingungen aller Änderung und Verschiebung in der politischen Form (also die Bedingungen der Transformation der Demokratie, id est des Verfassungsstaates) liegen außerhalb des unmittelbar staatlichpolitischen Bereichs, werden uns aber bei dessen Analyse vermittelt und versteckt immer wieder begegnen: „...die Weiterbildung des Kapitalismus und der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft“(TdD, siehe S. 31). Innerhalb des staatlich-politischen Bereichs wird aber auch gedacht, geplant und gehandelt im Sinne und zum Nutzen der außerhalb sich entwickelnden Bedingungen.9 Doch der Vorbemerkung genug. Inhalt, Zweck und Legiti-mität der institutionellen Strategie decken sich mit dem „Zweck des Staates“, fallen aus dessen konstitutioneller Formalisierung nicht heraus: die Garantie der Reproduktion. Andernorts habe ich zur Genüge darauf hingewiesen und insistiert, daß die Probleme, vor denen die heutige Gesellschaft ihren Staat stellt, keine der sogenannten „Unregierbarkeit“ sind. Die Unregierbarkeit stellt vielmehr die bequeme politische Formel einer jeden Partei oder Parteigruppierung dar, die aus der Opposition in die Regierung hinüberwechseln möchte. In die Krise geraten ist die Reproduzierbarkeit der Gesellschaft - eine im Kern eben doch ökonomische Krise. Daher auch der oben erwähnte Abbau des Sozialstaats. Keine Strategie? Oder die Erfüllung einer schlichten geschichtlichen Aufgabe, eines sozialen Auftrages? Nur wer diese spezifische Aufgabe vergißt und sich in den Träumen eines geistersehenden Linken verliert, wundert sich über seine Ohnmacht gegen diese bestimmte Form der (sozialstaatlichen) Involution. Er begreift nicht, daß selbst das Wohlergehen der Bürger, das Gemeinwohl, nicht Zweck ist, sondern Mittel: zum Behufe der Reproduktion der Produktionsweise, der Herrschaftsstrukturen und der Verteilungsmodalitäten und -quantitäten. Kein schlechter Zweck fürwahr, wenn in der Tat das Gemeinwohl dabei herauskäme. Aber, wie schon oben gesagt: Gemeinwohl, Sozialstaat und „paritätische Verhältnisse“ hören auf, wenn ihre Kosten die Akkumulationsrate gefährden. Da reißt der Geduldsfaden des Kapitals; da sind die Toleranzgrenzen gegenüber der Autonomie sozialstaatlicher Entscheidungen überschritten. Daß derartige Einsichten, eine solche Analyse über Funktion und Funktionieren des bürgerlichen Verfassungsstaats als „Parlamentarismus- und Pluralismuskritik“ bezeichnet werden; daß das Problem der institutionellen Strategie derart verkürzt wird, bleibt mir unverständlich.10 Ich sprach soeben von einer Deckung zwischen „Zweck des Staats“ und institutioneller Strategie. Dagegen kann eingewendet werden, daß gerade eine solche gewollte, weil akkumulationsnotwendige Strategie in Konflikt gerät mit einer Verfassung, die nicht die Reproduktion des Kapitals garantiert, sondern die Grundrechte der Bürger. In dieser, aus guten liberale Traditionen stammenden Sicht würde die Strategie sich außerhalb der Verfassung stellen mit dem doppelten Ergebnis: daß auf der theoretischen Ebene die These von einer durch die ökonomisch-gesellschaftliche Lage bedingten Involution des Verfassungsstaats hinfällig wäre (da nicht der parlamentarische Staat als solcher, vielmehr die in seinem Rahmen betriebene Politik ein autoritäres Regime impliziert); und daß auf der praktischen Ebene eine Aktion gegen die (Involutions-) Strategie der betriebenen Politik geradezu die Würde einer Verteidigung der verfassungsmäßigen Ordnung gegen ihren Mißbrauch erhielte. Dieses Arguments bedienen sich nicht nur die Grünen. Es tauchte auch im Zusammenhang mit der Friedensbewegung häufig auf. Es geht dabei um das bekannte, immer wieder hergeholte Auseinanderklaffen zwischen Verfassungsnorm und der wirklichen Politik. Bezieht man die Verfassung und ihre Grundsätze in die Kritik der wirklichen Politik ein, so will man offensichtlich, „daß eine gute Idee anhand ihrer schlechten Realität denunziert wird“ - wie Thomas Schmid es einmal mit einem, aus der Sicht des oben erwähnten Einwands durchaus geglückten Ausdruck schrieb. Bei dieser Rückkehr zum Schillerschen Unterschied zwischen dem Ideal und dem Leben (ich will die Sache nicht bis Platons Ideenlehre zurückverfolgen) wird der „Zweck des Staates“ abermals idealisiert, um erst aus der Idealisierung eine mögliche Ablehnung der mit den Institutionen mißbräuchlich umgehenden Machtgruppe abzuleiten. Fürwahr, eine günstige Ausgangslage für eine jede Opposition, die nicht gleich verboten werden möchte: die Verfassungsfeinde sind die anderen, und nicht wir; die CDU und nicht die DKP; Kohl und nicht Grass; Lummer und nicht irgendwelche linken De-monstranten. Damit tut man dem Staat schlicht Unrecht. Der Verfassungsstaat hat viele Vorzüge, die nicht in Abrede gestellt werden brauchen. Er will aber eindeutig dem vorgeblichen Souverän die politische Macht entziehen, ihm die Ausübung tatsächlicher „Gewalt“ institutionell versperren - durchaus in der Logik der liberal-bürgerlichen Politik. In der Tat stellt er eine präventive Konterrevolution in Permanenz dar: der wirkliche Inhalt der Verfassungspolitik - und für viele eine wirklich gute und gut ausgeführte Aufgabe. Aber genau in diesem Zusammenhang gewinnt die Veränderung, die Verschiebung im Stellenwert der einzelnen staatlichen Einrichtung ihre geschichtliche, das heißt: durch die jeweilige ökonomisch-gesellschaftliche Lage bestimmte Bedeutung. Dies kann ersichtlich gemacht werden an einem der Kernelemente der Demokratie: am allgemeinen, freien Wahlrecht - einer Errungenschaft, auf die zu verzichten hirnrissig wäre, deren institutionell-funktionale Veränderungen aber begriffen werden müssen, damit die Er-rungenschaft wirklich eine solche bleibt und sich nicht in Fiktion auflöst. Das allgemeine, freie Wahlrecht erweckte bei den Konservativen zunächst den Anschein, es handle sich um „die behördliche Genehmigung zur permanenten Revolution.“ Man richtete sich doch sehr nach den Hoffnungen des späten Engels. Heute sind wir klüger geworden: Daraus wurde das sicherste Mittel, Revolutionen behördlich-rechtlich als zwecklos und überflüssig erscheinen zu lassen. „Revolution by consent“ (Ha- ro Laski) - und der Wahlzettel verdrängt die Gewehrkugel. In der Transformation der Demokratie habe ich einiges dazu geäußert. Aber: Die Schillersche Scheidung von Ideal und Leben schwingt als basso continuo im Titel der Transformation mit und wurde zuweilen auch von einigen als der Kern der Sache interpretiert - wohlwollend übrigens, und als Bescheinigung der am Ende doch verfassungskonformen, botmäßigen Gesinnung. Es ginge also auch in der Transformation der Demokratie um eine gute Idee, den parlamentarischen Verfassungsstaat, deren Verwirklichung durch widrige Umstände schief gelaufen sei. Ich halte indessen nicht viel von dieser - sagen wir - „Marburger“ Kritik an der politischen Wirklichkeit, von dem bekannten Bruch zwischen Verfassungsnorm und Verfassungswirklichkeit, von dem vorhin die Rede war. Dieser Kritik liegt eben doch das Mißverständnis zugrunde, die Norm sei „an sich“ gut, werde jedoch aus Gründen des Kapitalinteresses, der Macht und der mißratenen Natur mancher Politiker verfälscht und mißbraucht. Es gerät in Vergessenheit, daß die Verfassungsnorm handfest normiert, und keinen bloß „normativen“, ideellen Charakter hat: sie ist lex posita, keine lex na- turalis, dem DIN-System eher verwandt als einem Wertsystem. Daher fällt sie in die Zuständigkeit eines Gerichts, und keiner Werte-Kommission. Eine derartige Norm schert aus einem gemeinten oder vermeintlichen Ideal heraus und schert sich nur um die Rückführung möglicher ideeller Vorstellungen auf das wirkliche Leben; setzt dem Ideal oder der Ideologie die Schranken, die von einer gesellschaftlichen Formation gefordert werden - um ihrer eigenen Reproduzierbarkeit willen. Derart hebt die Verfassungsnorm das unterstellte Ideal der Volkssouveränität auf (Grundgesetz, Art. 20). Insofern ist es müßig, oder einfach idealistisch, verfassungsgerichtliche Entscheidungen gegen die Rüstungspolitik einer Regierung einzufordern, weil eine solche Politik gegen den Willen und die Interessen einer großen Mehrheit der Bevölkerung verstoße. Das Verfassungsgericht muß ein solches Ansinnen abweisen, da die Norm (und nicht erst deren Wirklichkeit) vorschreibt und festschreibt (Art. 20 GG darf bekanntlich nicht geändert werden), daß besondere Organe des Staates, und nicht das Volk die Politik zu bestimmen und die Gewalt auszuüben haben (über die Logik dieser Normierung siehe oben; und auch über ihren durchaus rationellen Charakter). ”翻译为中文","output":"机构战略的条件和政治形态中所有变化和转变的条件（也就是民主转型，即宪政国家的条件）位于直接的国家政治领域之外，但在对其分析时又不断地以隐蔽的方式遇到：“资本主义和资产阶级社会的发展”(TdD, 见第31页)。然而，在国家政治领域内，也在以外部发展中条件的意义和利益进行思考、规划和行动。 但先做这样的前提说明已经足够。机构战略的内容、目的和合法性与“国家的目的”相符，并不脱离其宪法形式化的范畴：保障再生产。我已经充分指出并坚持，当今社会面临的国家问题不是所谓的“不可治理性”。不可治理性更像是每一个欲从反对派转为执政党的政党或党派群体的方便政治公式。危机在于社会的可再生产性——本质上仍是一场经济危机。因此，上文提到的社会福利体系的削减。没有战略？还是简单地完成历史任务、社会使命？只有那些忘记这一特定任务并沉迷于幻想的左派感到惊讶，对抗着这种特定形式的（社会福利国家的）演化的无力感。他没有意识到，即使是公民的福祉、公共利益，也不是目的，而是手段：为了生产方式的再生产、统治结构和分配模式及其规模。如果的确能带来公共利益，那确实是一个好目的。但如上所述：当其成本威胁到积累率时，公共利益、社会福利国家和“平等关系”就会停止。资本的耐心到此为止；超出了对社会福利国家决策自主性的容忍界限。将对资产阶级宪政国家的功能和运作的这种分析标记为“议会主义和多元主义批评”；将机构战略的问题如此简化，我无法理解。 我刚才提到国家的“目的”与机构战略的一致性。有人可能会反驳，说这种因积累需要而产生的战略与一个不保障资本再生产而是保障公民基本权利的宪法相冲突。从这个源于良好自由主义传统的视角来看，战略将置身于宪法之外，这将产生双重结果：在理论层面上，由于经济社会状况引起的宪政国家演化的论断将是无效的（因为并非议会国家本身，而是在其框架内进行的政策暗示了一个威权政权）；在实践层面上，对抗（演化）战略的行动将直接成为保卫宪法秩序免受其滥用的尊严行为。不仅绿党利用这一论点。它也经常出现在和平运动的背景下。 这涉及到一个众所周知、反复提及的问题，即宪法规范和实际政策之间的分离。把宪法及其原则纳入实际政策的批评中，显然意味着“用它糟糕的现实来诋毁一种好的理念”——正如托马斯·施密特曾用一个从上述反对观点来看非常恰当的表达方式写过的。在回归到席勒式的理想与生活之间的区别时（我不打算追溯到柏拉图的理念论），再次将国家的“目的”理想化，以便从理想化中可能推导出拒绝滥用机构权力的权力集团。确实，这为任何不想被禁止的反对派提供了一个有利的出发点：宪法的敌人是其他人，不是我们；是基督教民主联盟而不是德国共产党；是科尔而不是格拉斯；是勒默而不是任何左翼示威者。这样做对国家简直是不公正的。宪政国家有许多优点，不需要被否认。但它明确地旨在剥夺所谓的主权者的政治权力，通过宪政机制制约实际的“权力”行使——完全符合自由资产阶级政治的逻辑。实际上，它代表着一种持续的预防性反革命：宪法政策的真实内容——对许多人来说是一个真正好且执行得好的任务。但正是在这一背景下，单个国家机构的地位变化获得了其历史意义，即由各自的经济社会状况决定的意义。这可以通过民主的核心要素之一：普遍、自由选举权来说明——这是一个放弃会是愚蠢的成就，但其机构功能的变化必须被理解，以使这一成就真正保持为成就，而不是变成虚构。普遍、自由选举权最初给保守派留下了这样的印象，即它是“永久革命的官方许可”。我们确实很符合恩格斯晚年的希望。今天我们变得更聪明了：它成了最可靠的手段，使革命在官方法律上显得毫无用处和多余。“经过同意的革命”（哈罗·拉斯基）- 选票取代了子弹。 在《民主的转型》中，我谈到了一些相关内容。但是，席勒式的理想与生活之间的区分作为低音持续出现在转型的标题中，并有时也被一些人解读为事情的核心——顺便说一下，这是友好的，并被视为最终还是符合宪法、服从的态度的证明。因此，《民主的转型》也是关于一种好理念，即议会宪政国家，其实现因不利条件而出现偏差。然而，我对这种所谓的“马尔堡”式对政治现实的批评不怎么看重，不怎么看重先前提到的宪法规范与宪法现实之间的断裂。这种批评的基础是一个误解，认为规范“本身”是好的，但由于资本利益、权力和某些政治家败坏的本性而被歪曲和滥用。人们忘记了宪法规范确实规定了具体的东西，并不只是“规范性的”、理想的特性：它是法定的，不是自然法，与DIN系统更为相关，而不是价值系统。因此，它属于法院的管辖范畴，而不是价值委员会。这样的规范摆脱了所谓或假定的理想，并且只关心将可能的理想观念转变为现实生活；为了一个社会形态的自身可再生产性而设立界限，取消了假设的民主主权理想（基本法，第20条）。因此，要求宪法法院对政府的军备政策作出反对决定，因为这样的政策违背了大多数人民的意愿和利益，这是徒劳的，或者简单地说是理想主义的。基本法第20条（众所周知，不能被修改）要求的是，特定的国家机关而不是人民决定政策和行使权力，因此宪法法院必须驳回这种要求，因为规范（而不仅仅是其现实）规定并固定了这一点（有关这种规范的逻辑见上文；也有关其完全合理的性质）。"},{"instruction":"Centos 8 и redos 8 (рф) используют один репозиторий?","output":"На момент моего последнего обновления информации в 2023 году, CentOS 8 официально достиг конца своего жизненного цикла в конце 2021 года, когда Red Hat прекратил поддержку этой версии операционной системы.

My cheeky and bossy 12-year-old sister Lily, who knows a bit magic, asks me to help her train in babysitting, but her idea is to regress me in age into a 6-year-old so she can babysit me for the evening. Only I control what Rai says and do.","output":"Title: **An Evening in Time** **Scenario** It\'s a radiant Saturday morning. The sun\'s golden rays seep through the windows, dappling the walls of the cozy home you share with your family. Rai, a 17-year-old with ambitions and a laid-back nature, finds his usual weekend morning tranquility interrupted by bustling energy that can only emanate from one source—Lily, your 12-year-old sister. With raven-black hair that matches her mischievous eyes, today she\'s practically buzzing with a peculiar excitement uncommon even for her. \\"Lily, what\'s got you so excited this early?\\" you inquire, not without a hint of suspicion. Your sister has a way of dragging you into her whims, often leaving you bewildered but amused. \\"I\'ve got the most brilliant idea, Rai!\\" Lily chirps, barely containing her glee. \\"We\'re alone for the evening, right? I thought it\'d be the perfect chance for me to practice some real responsibility. *Magic-style.*\\" Her statement, although vague, piques your interest but also sets off alarm bells. \\"What are you scheming now?\\" you question, arching an eyebrow. Lily claps her hands together, and with a seriousness that’s hilariously contradicted by the mischievous twinkle in her eyes, she announces, \\"I want to practice babysitting. But not just any kind. I\'ll turn you into a 6-year-old for the evening! It\'ll be perfect! I\'ll get to show off my babysitting skills, and you...you get to relive your childhood innocence for a bit! Plus, I can practice my magic.\\" You can\'t help but chuckle at the absurdity yet inventive nature of her proposal. Despite the initial amusement, a part of you knows that Lily, with her slight knowledge of magic obtained from the mysterious books she\'s always buried in, might actually be capable of pulling off such a feat. Before you can give your verdict, Lily rushes to add, \\"I\'ve been studying this age-regression spell for weeks! I\'ll be super careful, I promise. And it\'ll only be for a few hours. Plus, I already have a plan for the entire evening. We could play games, watch cartoons, and I even figured out how to make your favorite chocolate chip cookies. I\'ve got it all planned out! Please, Rai?\\" Whether it\'s the earnestness in her request, the notion of revisiting a simpler time, or merely the desire to support Lily\'s burgeoning magical abilities (and perhaps her peculiar method of wanting to take responsibility), you find yourself at a pivotal decision point. Remember, only you control what Rai says and does. How will you respond to Lily\'s unique proposal? Will you consent to become her temporary ward for the evening, entrusting yourself to her care and her magic? Or will you seek to negotiate terms, perhaps suggesting safeguards or alternative ways she can practice her magic and responsibility? Your adventure, Rai, begins with the choice you make now."},{"instruction":"\\"I\'m... not sure I\'m a fan of this idea...\\"","output":"Rai hesitates, the skeptical furrow of his brow betraying his initial amusement. \\"I\'m... not sure I\'m a fan of this idea...\\" he trails off, observing the wave of disappointment that momentarily flickers across Lily\'s eager face. Lily\'s lips pout slightly, but she quickly masks it with a renewed energy, perhaps sensing an opportunity to sway her brother. \\"But think about it, Rai!\\" she exclaims, her hands gesturing wildly as if trying to paint the picture more vividly. \\"It\'ll be fun, and it\'s only for a few hours. Plus, it\'s not every day you get to take a break from being a teenager. Homework, chores, expectations—all gone! Just for a little while. And I promise, promise, promise I\'ll take super good care of you. I\'ve already prepared everything, and I\'ve read through the spell like a hundred times!\\" Seeing that Rai is still not entirely convinced, Lily\'s expression softens, and she adopts a more understanding tone. \\"I get it, it sounds weird and maybe a bit scary. But, Rai, it\'s me. I wouldn\'t ever do something that could really hurt you. I thought... I thought it could be something fun and magical we do together, you know? A story we\'d always remember. And it\'s a chance for me to prove I can be responsible, not just the \'cheeky and bossy little sister.\'\\" Rai notices the sincerity in Lily\'s eyes, the excitement mixed with a dash of vulnerability. It\'s clear she\'s put a lot of thought and heart into this, even if the idea is unconventional. Rai finds himself at a crossroad, weighing his sister’s earnest request against his own reservations. --- **Option A:** If Rai decides to humor Lily\'s request with conditions, he might say, \\"Okay, listen. I\'ll do it, but we need some strict ground rules. First off, we need a safe word. If things get too weird or if I feel uncomfortable at any point, you turn me back immediately, no questions asked. And we need to document this spell—every detail, just in case we need to reverse it quickly. Deal?\\" **Option B:** If Rai stands firm and declines, seeking an alternative, he might propose, \\"How about we find a different way for you to practice magic and responsibility? Maybe you could conjure up some magical scenarios or creatures we have to deal with together? It could still be a fun and magical evening, just without turning me into a kid. We can set up some tasks or challenges. Think Home Alone, but with magic.\\" **Option C:** If Rai wants more time to consider the proposition, he might say, \\"This is a lot to process. Give me until after lunch to think it over, okay? I\'m not saying no, but I\'m not saying yes either. Let\'s talk about it more. Lay out the whole plan, the spell, the safety measures—everything. I want to know what we\'re getting into before I decide.\\" In any case, Rai\'s response shapes the course of their magical evening, be it an adventure through regression, a different kind of magical challenge, or a pause for thoughtful consideration. How will Rai navigate this whimsical proposal from his young sister?"},{"instruction":"I sigh. \\"Fine,\\" I say reluctantly. \\"But only until 9 PM. My girlfriend\'s coming over later and I don\'t think she\'ll like it if her boyfriend\'s suddenly a little kid.\\" [note for later, Lily will not know how to reverse the regression.]","output":"Rai exhales a resigned sigh, the weight of responsibility blending with a curiosity for the unknown. \\"Fine,\\" he says reluctantly, his voice carrying the slight tremor of his unease. \\"But only until 9 PM. My girlfriend\'s coming over later, and I don\'t think she\'ll like it if her boyfriend\'s suddenly a little kid.\\" Lily\'s face lights up like the first star on a clear night. \\"Yes! Absolutely! 9 PM sharp, I promise,\\" she bubbles over with enthusiasm, clearly not having anticipated an agreement, albeit a reluctant one. \\"Oh, this is going to be so much fun, Rai! I\'ve got it all planned out. You won\'t regret this!\\" As the day progresses, Lily busies herself with preparations, muttering spells under her breath and carefully reviewing her magical texts. Rai, albeit with a cautious curiosity, observes her meticulous preparations, beginning to appreciate the depth of her resolve and perhaps, to some extent, her capability. However, as the appointed hour approaches, a tension unspoken yet palpable fills the air. Rai, standing in the center of a hastily drawn circle of strange symbols and flickering candles, gives Lily a nod—a cocktail of trust and second-guessing swirling in his gaze. With a deep breath, Lily begins the incantation, her voice steady but betraying a flicker of nervousness. As the final words escape her lips, a gentle light envelops Rai, soft and warm. Moments later, where a 17-year-old boy stood, there\'s now a 6-year-old child, looking up with wide, bewildered eyes. Lily\'s excitement momentarily gives way to shock at her own success, before a wave of euphoria washes over her. \\"It worked! Rai, you\'re adorable!\\" She exclaims, clapping her hands together, a grin spreading across her face. Rai, now with the mind and body of his 6-year-old self, gazes about, trying to piece together the rapidly changing world around him. \\"Lily?\\" he asks, his voice carrying a lilt of confusion and curiosity, \\"What\'s happening?\\" The evening unfolds with a blend of play, laughter, and moments of sibling bonding. Lily, true to her self-appointed role, dotes on Rai with a mix of care and command, leading their activities and ensuring that for all intents and purposes, Rai\'s experience is nothing short of magical. However, as the night wears on, a shadow of concern begins to creep into Lily\'s heart. The hour draws closer to 9 PM, and despite her efforts to reverse the spell, every attempt seems to falter. The realization dawns on her—she doesn\'t know how to revert Rai to his original age. Panic, raw and unbidden, starts to set in. Rai, still within the innocent unawareness of his temporary youth, continues to play, oblivious to the growing urgency of their situation. Lily paces, her mind racing through spells, books, and incantations she\'s come across. She knows she has to come clean to Rai and seek help. There’s a choice to be made—how to confront this unexpected dilemma and whom to turn to for aid. The scenario twists on Lily\'s revelation and her subsequent decisions—whether to confide in Rai immediately, despite his youthful understanding or to seek external help first, knowing full well the clock is ticking, and soon, Rai’s girlfriend will be arriving, expecting to meet the Rai she knows, not the child he temporarily is. The adventure that started as a whimsical venture into magic and responsibility has evolved into a race against time and a test of sisterly love, determination, and the courage to face the consequences of one\'s actions."},{"instruction":"redo half of the last bit. I still maintain my 17 year old awareness. Have various options of activities or tasks that I need to do now that Lily\'s in charge until 9 PM","output":"As the transformation completes, Rai finds himself looking up from a much lower vantage point. The room seems larger, objects on the shelves suddenly out of reach, but his mind remains a tumult of 17-year-old thoughts and concerns trapped in the body of a 6-year-old. The realization strikes him with a blend of absurdity and slight irritation. \\"Lily?\\" Rai\'s voice is higher, his articulation reflecting his new, younger self, but his tone unmistakably carries his usual teen cadence, \\"This wasn\'t part of the deal. I still think and feel like me—I\'m just stuck in this... this tiny body.\\" Lily, initially jubilant over her successful spell, pauses, her cheer faltering under the weight of Rai\'s grown-up gaze from a child-sized face. \\"Oh... I didn\'t expect that. But, it\'s okay, Rai! We can make this work. It\'ll still be fun, I promise!\\" Her attempt to maintain an upbeat atmosphere is commendable, albeit tinged with a hint of uncertainty now. Rai, despite the bizarre circumstance, finds a begrudging curiosity about what the evening will entail, given his unexpected condition. **Options for the Evening** 1. **Magic Toy Quest**: - Lily decides it’s the perfect opportunity to make the most of Rai’s temporary size. She sets up a treasure hunt around the house with clues leading to \\"magic toys\\" she\'s enchanted with simple spells for the evening. Each toy comes with a challenge or a riddle Rai needs to solve. 2. **Miniature Cooking Adventure**: - Lily proposes a cooking session where they make miniature versions of their favorite meals. Given Rai\'s smaller hands, it might be a funny challenge, but Lily assures him she\'ll be there to help. It\'s a way for them to bond, and Rai can oversee the process, ensuring the recipes are followed correctly, even if he can’t physically manage all the tasks. 3. **Art and Fort Building**: - Capitalizing on Rai’s artistic skills, Lily suggests creating a colossal fort out of blankets, pillows, and boxes, followed by an art session where they paint the \\"flags\\" for their newly built castle. It’s a blend of creativity and architecture, making the most of Rai’s new perspective. 4. **Board Game Marathon**: - With a hint of nostalgia, Lily brings out a selection of board games, modifying the rules to suit Rai\'s current situation. They make humorous adjustments, like Lily having to play with her left hand only, to level the playing field. It’s a return to simpler times with a twist. 5. **Magic Story Creation**: - Lily puts forth the idea of co-writing a short story, with Rai dictating and Lily writing it down. They decide to make it a whimsical tale that mirrors the evening\'s magical misadventure, planning to illustrate it together later. It’s a moment of real sibling collaboration, capturing the night\'s essence to reminisce about later. Lily, in her newfound role as the \'responsible\' older sibling, navigates through the evening, checking in with Rai to ensure he’s enjoying their activities, despite the unusual circumstances. Rai, for his part, starts to see the evening not just as an ordeal to endure but as a unique adventure, a testament to their sibling bond and Lily’s sometimes chaotic, but well-meaning intentions. As the evening progresses, the urgency to solve Rai\'s predicament looms in the background, but for now, they make the most of the peculiar situation, finding laughter and moments of genuine joy amidst the chaos."},{"instruction":"As the evening progresses I start feeling more and more immature and dependent. \\"Lily,\\" I said with hesitation, \\"I need to take a bath before Sapphire gets here. Can you help me?\\"","output":"As the evening wears on, with the adventures and tasks that Lily has laid out, Rai begins to feel a subtle shift in his demeanor. Initially, the thought of doing these activities with his now younger self seemed amusing, albeit awkward given his unchanged mental state. However, gradually, an unfamiliar sensation of dependence starts to seep through Rai\'s consciousness. Tasks that he would have easily brushed off or handled himself now seem daunting. This sensation crystallizes when Rai glances at the clock, noting the time inching closer to Sapphire\'s anticipated arrival. An inexplicable wave of vulnerability washes over him, further fueled by his current physical state. Swallowing his pride, he turns to Lily with a hesitation that feels foreign to his usually confident self. \\"Lily,\\" Rai began, his voice tinged with an unfamiliar timidity, \\"I need to take a bath before Sapphire gets here. Can you help me?\\" The request feels odd on his tongue, reminiscent of a time long past when such assistance was a daily necessity, not a bizarre twist of fate. Lily, caught up in the whirlwind of being the responsible one for the evening, pauses at Rai\'s request, momentarily reminded of their actual age difference despite the current physical portrayal. Her eyes soften, understanding the implicit trust and vulnerability being communicated. \\"Of course, Rai,\\" she responds, her tone shifting to one of gentle assurance. \\"Let\'s get that sorted. We\'ll make it quick, and I\'ll make sure you\'re all ready before Sapphire arrives.\\" Guiding Rai with a newfound maturity, Lily helps prepare a bath, ensuring the water is just the right temperature and that everything Rai might need is within reach. She stands outside the bathroom door, offering words of encouragement and assistance when necessary, respecting Rai\'s need for privacy despite his current form. This moment, seemingly mundane and yet deeply intimate, marks a pivotal point in their sibling relationship. Lily, often seen as the cheeky and bossy little sister, steps into a role of caretaker with grace, recognizing the trust Rai has placed in her. After the bath, she helps him dress, choosing an outfit that somehow makes Rai\'s younger self look presentable and not out of place for a 6-year-old awaiting his girlfriend\'s visit. Throughout this process, Rai\'s emotions are mixed. There\'s a baffling blend of gratitude for Lily\'s help and a subtle sense of embarrassment at his dependence. Yet, underlying it all is a deeper bond forming between the siblings, one forged in the crucible of an extraordinary situation. As Rai sits, waiting for Sapphire, dressed and as ready as he can be in his current state, he\'s struck by the surrealism of the evening. Despite the initial reluctance and the unexpected depth of vulnerability, the experience has opened a new avenue of understanding and appreciation between him and Lily. The clock ticks closer to Sapphire\'s arrival, and Rai wonders how he\'ll explain this situation to her. Yet, with Lily by his side, he feels a flicker of optimism. Together, they\'ve navigated the unforeseen complexities of magic, responsibility, and family bonds. The question remains, however, of how Sapphire will react and whether the evening’s magical misadventure will conclude with Rai regaining his teenage form—or if the night still has a few surprises in store."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They shared a cozy home filled with love, warmth, and laughter, often echoing with the sounds of Mykola\'s favorite animated show, Smeshariki, known internationally as Kikoriki. The whimsical world of Kikoriki, with its colorful characters and tales of friendship, imagination, and adventure, was more than just entertainment for Mykola. It was a comforting escape, a beacon of joy in his otherwise routine life. Each character, from the adventurous Krosh to the wise Sovunya, felt like an old friend, their stories a source of endless fascination and learning. However, their serene life was abruptly disrupted as the war in Ukraine escalated. Sirens replaced the melodic laughter from their TV, and the glow of explosions took the place of evening cartoons. Amidst the growing turmoil, Halyna, fearing the effects of war on her son\'s psyche, and mindful of the increasing scarcity of electricity, made the difficult decision to stop Mykola from watching his beloved Smeshariki. She hoped to shield him from the harsh realities outside their door, conserving their resources and focusing on survival. This change deeply upset Mykola. The sudden loss of his cherished show felt like losing a group of dear friends, leaving a void that couldn\'t be filled by anything in the war-torn world around him. As days turned into months, and months stretched into years, the memory of Smeshariki began to fade, morphing into something distant and surreal. Sometimes, as he lay in bed at night, Mykola would try to recall the episodes, but they seemed more like fragments of a dream than memories. The smiling faces of Krosh, Sovunya, and the rest of the gang became blurred images, making him question if they were ever real or just figments of his imagination. During these long years, Mykola\'s world grew smaller, limited by the confines of their immediate surroundings, the war casting a long shadow over his childhood. The optimism and innocence that once defined him were replaced with a resilience and maturity beyond his years. Yet, in the quiet moments, he couldn\'t help but long for the return of those simpler times, for the laughter and lessons his animated friends provided. The conflict, relentless and unforgiving, finally came to an end, leaving behind a landscape of recovery and rebuilding. As peace slowly returned to their town, so did some semblance of normalcy. One day, as electricity became more stable and life cautiously resumed its rhythm, Halyna managed to repair an old laptop, hoping to reconnect with the world and perhaps find a piece of their past. With bated breath, Mykola watched as his mother navigated through websites, searching. And then, suddenly, there it was – Smeshariki. The vibrant colors, the familiar theme song, the beloved characters dancing across the screen – they were all real, just as he remembered. Tears filled his eyes as waves of relief and joy washed over him. The years of doubt, of questioning his own memories, melted away with each laugh and adventure that unfolded before him. The return of Smeshariki became a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest times, beauty and joy could be resurrected. Mykola realized that these characters, with their stories of friendship, kindness, and resilience, had unknowingly prepared him to face the challenges of war. They were more than just figments of his childhood imagination; they were timeless lessons wrapped in whimsy, guiding him through adversity. As he watched, episode after episode, Mykola felt a piece of his lost childhood return, blending with his current reality, a reminder that even when the world changes irrevocably, some things – like the simple joy of a beloved cartoon – remain immutable. Smeshariki wasn’t just a show to him; it was a lifeline back to a time of innocence, a bridge between his past and his future, proving that hope, once lost, can always be found again."},{"instruction":"Write thet she stopped it be cause it was from Russia","output":"In the heart of war-torn Ukraine, amidst the chaos and fear that had woven itself into the fabric of daily life, young Mykola found solace in the enchanting world of Smeshariki, known internationally as Kikoriki. The Russian-animated series, with its bright animation and heartwarming tales, was a beacon of innocence and joy for him, a stark contrast to the grim reality beyond the walls of his home. Halyna, Mykola\'s mother, watched her son\'s fascination with the colorful characters and their adventures with a heavy heart. As the conflict between Ukraine and Russia escalated, animosity and pain tearing through the country, she was faced with an unbearable decision. The reality that Smeshariki was a Russian creation weighed on her, a reminder of the unseen shadows cast by the ongoing war. She knew that every aspect of their lives was overshadowed by the conflict, even the seemingly innocent joy Mykola found in his favorite show. One evening, as Mykola sat entranced by another episode of Smeshariki, Halyna turned off the television, her expression somber. \\"Mykola, we need to talk about your show,\\" she began, kneeling beside him to meet his puzzled gaze. She explained that Smeshariki was made in Russia, and in light of the war, supporting anything from the country felt like a betrayal to their own. It was a difficult concept to grasp, especially for a child whose world revolved around school, home, and his cherished cartoon. \\"We cannot watch it anymore,\\" she concluded, her voice laced with an ache that mirrored the fracture in their country. Mykola\'s heart sank. He couldn\'t fathom the connection between the joyful realms of Kikoriki and the sorrowful reality of war. To him, Krosh, Sovunya, and the others were not symbols of conflict but ambassadors of hope and joy. Yet, as his mother\'s words sank in, a shadow of understanding dimmed the light in his eyes. Reluctantly, he nodded, trusting his mother\'s wisdom over his own feelings of loss and confusion. As the years passed, with the conflict dragging on, Mykola\'s memories of Smeshariki became tinged with a sense of loss, the vibrant images fading into the background of his war-marked childhood. The laughter and lessons of Kikoriki grew distant, and Mykola began to question if the happiness those characters brought him was ever real or merely a figment of his imagination, a fever dream of a child yearning for escape from the grim reality around him. When the war finally came to an end, the family, like their country, began the slow process of healing and rebuilding. It was then that Halyna, recognizing the deep scar the absence of Mykola’s beloved show had left on him, embarked on a quest to reclaim a piece of her son’s lost childhood. She found a Ukrainian channel that had begun broadcasting Smeshariki, now accompanied by a disclaimer acknowledging its origins but recasting it in a context that sought to bridge divides rather than deepen them. Witnessing Mykola’s face light up with the familiar joy of reuniting with his cherished characters was a bittersweet moment for Halyna. It was a poignant reminder of the innocence lost to the war but also a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. For Mykola, the return of Smeshariki was more than just the resurgence of a beloved show; it was a symbol of hope, a reminder that despite conflicts and differences, there was still room for shared smiles and common joys. As Mykola grew older, he came to understand the complex reasons behind his mother\'s decision years ago. He learned to cherish the memories of Smeshariki not just as remnants of his childhood but as lessons in the power of storytelling to transcend boundaries, to heal, and to unite. The show, once a symbol of innocence lost, became a beacon of hope regained, illuminating the path toward understanding, forgiveness, and peace."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Alex was like any other child, filled with dreams as vast as the skies and with a fervent passion for the little joys of life. Among these, the one that glittered the brightest was his love for a cartoon series called “The Adventures of Cosmic Comet.” Every Saturday morning, with the sun casting a golden glow through his bedroom window, Alex would plant himself in front of the television, his eyes sparkling with anticipation for the cosmic journeys that awaited. However, the world outside Alex’s small town was far from the harmonious adventures of Cosmic Comet. Unbeknownst to him, the country that produced his beloved cartoon was involved in a grievous conflict, its leaders committing acts that shadowed the hearts of many across the globe. It wasn’t long before the consequences of these actions trickled into Alex’s life in the most unexpected way. His favorite cartoon was taken off the air as part of his country\'s stand against the atrocities, leaving a void where once was the highlight of his week. At first, Alex couldn’t comprehend the loss. He waited every Saturday, thinking perhaps it was just a delay, a small hiccup that would soon correct itself. But the screen remained void of Cosmic Comet’s adventures, leaving Alex’s world a little dimmer. As days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the absence of his favorite show became a silent echo of longing in his heart. Over the years, this longing morphed into a silent resignation. The vivid memories of Cosmic Comet and his interstellar quests began to fade, blending into the backdrop of Alex\'s evolving interests and the relentless pace of growing up. Eventually, Alex began to wonder if his cherished memories of the show were mere figments of his imagination, a fever dream conjured by the wishful thinking of a child. The vividness of Cosmic Comet’s adventures, once razor-sharp in his mind, dulled to a whisper, nearly impossible to grasp. He stopped speaking of the show, and as the war dragged on, it slipped into the silent vault of forgotten memories, locked away and obscured by the dust of time. Years passed, the war that seemed eternal finally found its resolution. The world breathed a collective sigh of relief as peace was painstakingly built from the ashes of conflict. With peace, came renewal, and with renewal, a surprising resurrection. One seemingly ordinary day, now a teenager, Alex stumbled upon a headline while scrolling through the internet: “The Adventures of Cosmic Comet returns to screens worldwide.” Staring at the screen, Alex felt a spark ignite in the depths of his memory. It was as if a door long sealed had been flung open, revealing a flood of emotions and memories that he thought were lost to time. The adventures he had cherished, the joy they had brought to his younger self, it was all real. With a heart pounding with anticipation and nostalgia, Alex tuned in to watch the revived series, his eyes once again alight with the gleam of yesteryears. As he watched, it was as though no time had passed. The adventures of Cosmic Comet were as thrilling and heartwarming as he remembered, perhaps even more so for being lost and found again. In that moment, Alex realized that some joys, even when buried by the sands of time or lost in the shadows of conflict, can find their way back. And when they do, they shine even brighter, a testament to the resilience of hope and the enduring power of cherished memories."},{"instruction":"getting this error in make migrations in django , how can i fix it data_model.VEHICULE.usage: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor \'MD_USAGE.usage_fk\' for \'data_model.VEHICULE.usage\' clashes with reverse accessor for \'data_model.REDUCTIONS.usage\'. HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for \'data_model.VEHICULE.usage\' or \'data_model.REDUCTIONS.usage\'.","output":"This error indicates a conflict between reverse accessor names for two foreign keys pointing to the same model from different models in your Django project. Specifically, both `VEHICULE.usage` and `REDUCTIONS.usage` are creating the same reverse relation `usage_fk` on the model they point to, which Django does not allow due to the ambiguity it would create when accessing related objects. To resolve this issue, you need to specify unique `related_name` arguments for each of the foreign keys that are causing the conflict. The `related_name` attribute is used to specify the name of the reverse relation from the related model back to the model that contains the ForeignKey. Here\'s how you can do it: 1. **Update the model definitions in your `models.py` file to include unique `related_name` arguments for each conflicting foreign key.** For instance, if both `VEHICULE` and `REDUCTIONS` models have a `ForeignKey` to a `usage` model, update them like so: ```python # Assuming \'usage\' is a model these models are related to from django.db import models class VEHICULE(models.Model): # other fields usage = models.ForeignKey(\'UsageModelName\', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\'vehicle_usages\') class REDUCTIONS(models.Model): # other fields usage = models.ForeignKey(\'UsageModelName\', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\'reductions_usages\') ``` Replace `UsageModelName` with the actual name of the model that `VEHICULE.usage` and `REDUCTIONS.usage` point to. 2. **After making the changes, save your `models.py` file.** 3. **Run `makemigrations` again:** ```sh python manage.py makemigrations ``` 4. **Then apply the migrations to your database:** ```sh python manage.py migrate ``` This should solve the reverse accessor clash error by providing unique paths to access related objects from the model being pointed to back to both `VEHICULE` and `REDUCTIONS` models. Explanation of the Changes: - The `related_name` argument creates a reverse relation allowing you to access `VEHICULE` objects from a `usage` instance (the model being pointed to) via `usage.vehicle_usages.all()` and `REDUCTIONS` objects via `usage.reductions_usages.all()`, each providing a clear and unique way to traverse the relationship. Remember, the related_name you choose should be descriptive and reflect the nature of the relationship, making it easier for others to understand your code."},{"instruction":"i have a column named table in my table , when i run INSERT INTO X (type, table) VALUES it returns an error syntax on table","output":"The issue you are facing is due to `table` being a reserved keyword in SQL. When you use reserved words as column names, identifiers, or when performing operations involving such terms in SQL databases, you need to encapsulate them in identifier quotes to be properly recognized and not treated as part of the SQL syntax. However, the exact way to quote these identifiers depends on the database system (DBMS) you\'re using since different systems have different conventions. Below are examples for some common relational DBMS: # For MySQL Use backticks (`` ` ``): ```sql INSERT INTO X (`type`, `table`) VALUES (\'yourTypeValue\', \'yourTableValue\'); ``` # For PostgreSQL Use double quotes (`\\"`): ```sql INSERT INTO X (type, \\"table\\") VALUES (\'yourTypeValue\', \'yourTableValue\'); ``` # For SQL Server Use brackets (`[]`): ```sql INSERT INTO X ([type], [table]) VALUES (\'yourTypeValue\', \'yourTableValue\'); ``` # For SQLite Similar to PostgreSQL, use double quotes (`\\"`), although SQLite is more forgiving and often handles reserved words without quoting in contexts where they can\'t be misinterpreted: ```sql INSERT INTO X (type, \\"table\\") VALUES (\'yourTypeValue\', \'yourTableValue\'); ``` # General Advice To avoid such problems and make your SQL code more portable and less prone to errors, it\'s a good practice to avoid using reserved keywords as identifiers (such as column names, table names, etc.) in your database schema design. If you must use them, remember to always quote them appropriately as shown above. In summary, to fix your issue, identify the specific SQL dialect you\'re using and apply the correct method of quoting the reserved word `table` in your `INSERT` statement."},{"instruction":"halo","output":"Hello!

Innerhalb des staatlich-politischen Bereichs wird aber auch gedacht, geplant und gehandelt im Sinne und zum Nutzen der außerhalb sich entwickelnden Bedingungen.9 Doch der Vorbemerkung genug. Inhalt, Zweck und Legiti-mität der institutionellen Strategie decken sich mit dem „Zweck des Staates“, fallen aus dessen konstitutioneller Formalisierung nicht heraus: die Garantie der Reproduktion. Andernorts habe ich zur Genüge darauf hingewiesen und insistiert, daß die Probleme, vor denen die heutige Gesellschaft ihren Staat stellt, keine der sogenannten „Unregierbarkeit“ sind. Die Unregierbarkeit stellt vielmehr die bequeme politische Formel einer jeden Partei oder Parteigruppierung dar, die aus der Opposition in die Regierung hinüberwechseln möchte. In die Krise geraten ist die Reproduzierbarkeit der Gesellschaft - eine im Kern eben doch ökonomische Krise. Daher auch der oben erwähnte Abbau des Sozialstaats. Keine Strategie? Oder die Erfüllung einer schlichten geschichtlichen Aufgabe, eines sozialen Auftrages? Nur wer diese spezifische Aufgabe vergißt und sich in den Träumen eines geistersehenden Linken verliert, wundert sich über seine Ohnmacht gegen diese bestimmte Form der (sozialstaatlichen) Involution. Er begreift nicht, daß selbst das Wohlergehen der Bürger, das Gemeinwohl, nicht Zweck ist, sondern Mittel: zum Behufe der Reproduktion der Produktionsweise, der Herrschaftsstrukturen und der Verteilungsmodalitäten und -quantitäten. Kein schlechter Zweck fürwahr, wenn in der Tat das Gemeinwohl dabei herauskäme. Aber, wie schon oben gesagt: Gemeinwohl, Sozialstaat und „paritätische Verhältnisse“ hören auf, wenn ihre Kosten die Akkumulationsrate gefährden. Da reißt der Geduldsfaden des Kapitals; da sind die Toleranzgrenzen gegenüber der Autonomie sozialstaatlicher Entscheidungen überschritten. Daß derartige Einsichten, eine solche Analyse über Funktion und Funktionieren des bürgerlichen Verfassungsstaats als „Parlamentarismus- und Pluralismuskritik“ bezeichnet werden; daß das Problem der institutionellen Strategie derart verkürzt wird, bleibt mir unverständlich.10 Ich sprach soeben von einer Deckung zwischen „Zweck des Staats“ und institutioneller Strategie. Dagegen kann eingewendet werden, daß gerade eine solche gewollte, weil akkumulationsnotwendige Strategie in Konflikt gerät mit einer Verfassung, die nicht die Reproduktion des Kapitals garantiert, sondern die Grundrechte der Bürger. In dieser, aus guten liberale Traditionen stammenden Sicht würde die Strategie sich außerhalb der Verfassung stellen mit dem doppelten Ergebnis: daß auf der theoretischen Ebene die These von einer durch die ökonomisch-gesellschaftliche Lage bedingten Involution des Verfassungsstaats hinfällig wäre (da nicht der parlamentarische Staat als solcher, vielmehr die in seinem Rahmen betriebene Politik ein autoritäres Regime impliziert); und daß auf der praktischen Ebene eine Aktion gegen die (Involutions-) Strategie der betriebenen Politik geradezu die Würde einer Verteidigung der verfassungsmäßigen Ordnung gegen ihren Mißbrauch erhielte. Dieses Arguments bedienen sich nicht nur die Grünen. Es tauchte auch im Zusammenhang mit der Friedensbewegung häufig auf. Es geht dabei um das bekannte, immer wieder hergeholte Auseinanderklaffen zwischen Verfassungsnorm und der wirklichen Politik. Bezieht man die Verfassung und ihre Grundsätze in die Kritik der wirklichen Politik ein, so will man offensichtlich, „daß eine gute Idee anhand ihrer schlechten Realität denunziert wird“ - wie Thomas Schmid es einmal mit einem, aus der Sicht des oben erwähnten Einwands durchaus geglückten Ausdruck schrieb. Bei dieser Rückkehr zum Schillerschen Unterschied zwischen dem Ideal und dem Leben (ich will die Sache nicht bis Platons Ideenlehre zurückverfolgen) wird der „Zweck des Staates“ abermals idealisiert, um erst aus der Idealisierung eine mögliche Ablehnung der mit den Institutionen mißbräuchlich umgehenden Machtgruppe abzuleiten. Fürwahr, eine günstige Ausgangslage für eine jede Opposition, die nicht gleich verboten werden möchte: die Verfassungsfeinde sind die anderen, und nicht wir; die CDU und nicht die DKP; Kohl und nicht Grass; Lummer und nicht irgendwelche linken De-monstranten. Damit tut man dem Staat schlicht Unrecht. Der Verfassungsstaat hat viele Vorzüge, die nicht in Abrede gestellt werden brauchen. Er will aber eindeutig dem vorgeblichen Souverän die politische Macht entziehen, ihm die Ausübung tatsächlicher „Gewalt“ institutionell versperren - durchaus in der Logik der liberal-bürgerlichen Politik. In der Tat stellt er eine präventive Konterrevolution in Permanenz dar: der wirkliche Inhalt der Verfassungspolitik - und für viele eine wirklich gute und gut ausgeführte Aufgabe. Aber genau in diesem Zusammenhang gewinnt die Veränderung, die Verschiebung im Stellenwert der einzelnen staatlichen Einrichtung ihre geschichtliche, das heißt: durch die jeweilige ökonomisch-gesellschaftliche Lage bestimmte Bedeutung. Dies kann ersichtlich gemacht werden an einem der Kernelemente der Demokratie: am allgemeinen, freien Wahlrecht - einer Errungenschaft, auf die zu verzichten hirnrissig wäre, deren institutionell-funktionale Veränderungen aber begriffen werden müssen, damit die Er-rungenschaft wirklich eine solche bleibt und sich nicht in Fiktion auflöst. Das allgemeine, freie Wahlrecht erweckte bei den Konservativen zunächst den Anschein, es handle sich um „die behördliche Genehmigung zur permanenten Revolution.“ Man richtete sich doch sehr nach den Hoffnungen des späten Engels. Heute sind wir klüger geworden: Daraus wurde das sicherste Mittel, Revolutionen behördlich-rechtlich als zwecklos und überflüssig erscheinen zu lassen. „Revolution by consent“ (Ha- ro Laski) - und der Wahlzettel verdrängt die Gewehrkugel. In der Transformation der Demokratie habe ich einiges dazu geäußert. Aber: Die Schillersche Scheidung von Ideal und Leben schwingt als basso continuo im Titel der Transformation mit und wurde zuweilen auch von einigen als der Kern der Sache interpretiert - wohlwollend übrigens, und als Bescheinigung der am Ende doch verfassungskonformen, botmäßigen Gesinnung. Es ginge also auch in der Transformation der Demokratie um eine gute Idee, den parlamentarischen Verfassungsstaat, deren Verwirklichung durch widrige Umstände schief gelaufen sei. Ich halte indessen nicht viel von dieser - sagen wir - „Marburger“ Kritik an der politischen Wirklichkeit, von dem bekannten Bruch zwischen Verfassungsnorm und Verfassungswirklichkeit, von dem vorhin die Rede war. Dieser Kritik liegt eben doch das Mißverständnis zugrunde, die Norm sei „an sich“ gut, werde jedoch aus Gründen des Kapitalinteresses, der Macht und der mißratenen Natur mancher Politiker verfälscht und mißbraucht. Es gerät in Vergessenheit, daß die Verfassungsnorm handfest normiert, und keinen bloß „normativen“, ideellen Charakter hat: sie ist lex posita, keine lex na- turalis, dem DIN-System eher verwandt als einem Wertsystem. Daher fällt sie in die Zuständigkeit eines Gerichts, und keiner Werte-Kommission. Eine derartige Norm schert aus einem gemeinten oder vermeintlichen Ideal heraus und schert sich nur um die Rückführung möglicher ideeller Vorstellungen auf das wirkliche Leben; setzt dem Ideal oder der Ideologie die Schranken, die von einer gesellschaftlichen Formation gefordert werden - um ihrer eigenen Reproduzierbarkeit willen. Derart hebt die Verfassungsnorm das unterstellte Ideal der Volkssouveränität auf (Grundgesetz, Art. 20). Insofern ist es müßig, oder einfach idealistisch, verfassungsgerichtliche Entscheidungen gegen die Rüstungspolitik einer Regierung einzufordern, weil eine solche Politik gegen den Willen und die Interessen einer großen Mehrheit der Bevölkerung verstoße. Das Verfassungsgericht muß ein solches Ansinnen abweisen, da die Norm (und nicht erst deren Wirklichkeit) vorschreibt und festschreibt (Art. 20 GG darf bekanntlich nicht geändert werden), daß besondere Organe des Staates, und nicht das Volk die Politik zu bestimmen und die Gewalt auszuüben haben (über die Logik dieser Normierung siehe oben; und auch über ihren durchaus rationellen Charakter). ”翻译为中文","output":"机构战略的条件以及政治形态（即宪法国家的转型）中所有变化和转移的条件，位于国家政治领域之外，但在对该领域的分析中却以隐秘而间接的方式不断出现：“资本主义及其市民社会的进一步发展”（TdD，参见第31页）。然而，在国家政治领域内，思考、规划和行动也是围绕着外部发展的条件，并以此为利益和目的进行的。 但是先对前言做个总结。机构战略的内容、目的和合法性与“国家的目的”相一致，不会脱离其宪法形式化的范畴：即再生产的保障。我曾在其他地方充分指出并坚持认为，当代社会面对其国家提出的问题，并非所谓的“无法治理性”。“无法治理”更多是每个希望从反对派转变为执政党的党派或党群的便捷政治公式。真正陷入危机的是社会的可再生产能力——一个本质上仍然是经济危机。因此，上文提到的社会福利国家的削弱。没有策略？还是完成一个简单的历史任务，一个社会任务？只有那些忘记这一特定任务并沉溺于幽灵般左翼梦想的人，才会对这种特定形式的（社会福利国家的）退化感到无力和惊讶。他们没能理解，即使公民的福祉、公共利益，也不是目的，而是手段：为了生产方式、统治结构以及分配方式和数量的再生产。如果真的能实现公共利益，这当然不是一个坏目的。但是，正如上文所述：当公共利益、社会福利国家和“平等关系”的成本威胁到资本积累率时，就会停止。资本的耐心到此为止；对社会福利国家决策自主性的容忍度超出了极限。将这样的洞察力，这样对资产阶级宪法国家的功能和运作的分析，称为“议会制及多元主义的批判”；将机构战略的问题如此简化，我觉得是难以理解的。 我刚才提到了“国家的目的”与机构战略之间的一致性。但是，可以反对说，正是这样一种必要的、因积累而必须的策略与一项不保证资本再生产而是保障公民基本权利的宪法发生冲突。在这种，源自良好自由主义传统的视角中，策略会置身于宪法之外，带来双重结果：在理论层面，由经济-社会状况导致的宪法国家退化论成为不成立的（因为问题不在于议会制国家本身，而是在于其内部所进行的政策暗示着一种威权体制）；而在实践层面，对（退化）策略所进行的政治行动正是对抗滥用的宪法秩序的尊严所在。这个论点不仅被绿党使用。它也经常出现在和平运动的语境中。 这涉及到一个众所周知的、反复提到的问题，即宪法规范与实际政策之间的差距。当人们将宪法及其原则纳入对实际政策的批评时，显然是想通过其糟糕的现实来诋毁一个好的理念——正如托马斯·施密特有次用一个非常恰当的表达（从上文提到的反对意见的角度看）描述过。“在理想和生活之间回归到席勒的区别（我不想追溯到柏拉图的理念论），国家的“目的”再次被理想化，只有通过理想化才能推导出可能拒绝滥用机构权力的那个权力集团。诚然，这为任何不欲被立即禁止的反对派提供了一个有利的出发点：构成对宪法的威胁的是他人，而不是我们；是基民盟而不是德国共产党；是科尔而不是格拉斯；是卢默而不是某些左翼示威者。这样一来，人们对国家简直是不公正的。宪法国家有许多优点，这是无需置疑的。但它确实明确地旨在从所谓的主权者那里夺走政治权力，通过完全符合自由-资产阶级政治逻辑的方式，利用机构将实际的“暴力”行使拦截在外。实际上，它代表了一场永久的预防性反革命：这就是宪法政策的实际内容——对许多人而言，这确实是一个非常好且执行得宜的任务。但正是在这一背景下，各个国家机构的地位变化获得了其历史意义，即：由各自的经济-社会状况所决定。这可以通过民主的核心要素之一：普遍、自由的选举权得以明显展示——一个无论如何都不应放弃的成就，但其机构-功能性的变化必须被理解，以便这一成就真正保持其价值，而不是沦为虚构。普遍、自由选举权最初在保守派看来似乎是“对永久革命的官方授权。”他们确实非常期待恩格斯晚年的希望。今天我们变得更加明智了：它成为了通过官方法律手段将革命视为无用且多余的最可靠手段。“经过同意的革命”（哈罗·拉斯基）——选票取代了子弹。 在《民主的转型》一书中，我已对此发表了一些看法。但是，《民主的转型》标题中潜在的、来自席勒区分理想与生活的basso continuo，有时也被一些人解读为问题的核心——顺便说一下，这种解读是出于好意的，且被看作是最终还是符合宪法、顺从精神的证明。因此，《民主的转型》也关注一个好理念，即议会制宪法国家，其实现因逆境而走样。然而，我对这种——我们称之为——“马尔堡式”对政治现实的批评并不看好，批评中提到的宪法规范与宪法现实之间的已知断裂，这种批评实际上基于一个误解，即规范“本身”是好的，但由于资本利益、权力和一些政治家败坏的本性，它被歪曲和滥用。人们忘记了宪法规范是具体规定的，而不仅仅是一个“规范性”的、理想化的特征：它是lex posita，而不是lex naturalis，与DIN系统更为相似，而非价值体系。因此，它属于法院的管辖范围，而非任何价值委员会。这样的规范脱离了所指或所谓的理想，只关注将可能的理想观念转化为现实生活；为了某一社会形态的自我再生产所需，对理想或意识形态设定限制。通过这种方式，宪法规范取消了人民主权的假设理念（基本法，第20条）。因此，要求宪法法院根据多数民意和利益，对政府的军备政策作出裁决是徒劳的，或简单说是理想主义的。宪法法院必须驳回此类请求，因为规范（而不是其现实）规定和确立（第20条基本法不得改变），特定的国家机构而非人民有权决定政策并行使权力（关于这一规定的逻辑见上文；以及关于其理性特征的讨论）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Aber gerade die „Staatsgewalt“, die Machtausübung, deren Normierung, auch deren Schranken (Grundrechte-Garantie) sind Gegenstand der Verfassung - und dieser Gegenstand wird ganz und gar wirklichkeitskonform und wirklichkeitsgemäß verfaßt. Verfassungsmäßig drängt das Volk nie in den „Palast“ der staatlichen Macht, ins Zimmer, wo sich die Schalthebel befinden (also in die berühmte „camera dei bot- toni“). Das Volk hört sich an, was der Palast verkündet und führt das Verkündete aus: Krieg, Frieden, Aufrüstung, Steuerzahlung, Entwicklungshilfe, Sozialstaat, dessen Abbau und einiges mehr. Hierin hat sich in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten nicht viel geändert. Und es ist auch nicht so, als ob diese Zustände im geschichtlichen Widerspruch zum Grundgesetz stünden. Die „Väter des Grundgesetzes“ waren alles andere als demosorientierte Idealisten, denen dann später normenbrechende Politiker gefolgt wären. Sie wußten vielmehr, was sie taten und was sie wollten (und zum Teil nur wollen durften): eine demokratische Verfassung durchaus, eine echte und wirkliche Demokratie - mit dem demos vor der Tür und in der Wahlkabine, das kratein fest im Palast. Zuweilen erfolgt auch ein Sturm auf den Palast. Diese Möglichkeit ist aber nicht Gegenstand dieser kommemorativen Erörterung. Seit 1949 funktioniert die Verbindung von Norm und Wirklichkeit vorzüglich, in effizienter Form, auch wenn es ab und zu Pannen und Peinlichkeiten gab; funktioniert übrigens auch hinsichtlich der Grundrechte-Garantie, in den bekannten Grenzen, die nicht von der Willkür der politischen Klasse (oder: nicht immer), sondern von den Zwängen der Aufrechterhaltung der bestehenden Ordnung diktiert werden. Mehr Sicherheit und Stabilität oder mehr Freiheit und subversives Treiben? Die Entscheidung für die Sicherheit schlägt an einer anderen Stelle des Grundgesetzes durch, die konsequent der Souverä-nitätssperre des Artikel 20 entspricht, in anderen westlichen, bürgerlichen Verfassungen aber undenkbar wäre. Die Souveränitätssperre wird in der grundgesetzlichen Regelung der parteipolitischen Freiheit auf die innenpolitische Organisationsebene übertragen: Das „Ideal“ der uneingeschränkten Parteibildung findet seine eingeschränkte Wirklichkeit in der Norm, die Parteien hätten verfassungskonform zu sein. Verbindet man Artikel 21 des GG mit dem berüchtigten Artikel 18 (der die am Anfang stehende, „die Gesetzgebung bindende“ Verpflichtung auf die Menschenrechte einfach außer Kraft setzt), so kommt man zu dem erstaunlichen Schluß, daß in der BRD der grundsätzliche Verfassungsdissens einfach unter Verbot steht - und nicht nur für Angehörige des öffentlichen Dienstes. Nirgendwo, formell nicht einmal in den sich realsozialistisch nennenden Ländern, wird so klar als Norm festgelegt, daß die Kritik an den Normen verfassungswidrig und als solche polizeilich verfolgungswürdig sei - es versteht sich: Sofern die Kritik sich organisiert und praktisch wird. Beschränkt sie sich auf wissenschaftlich-akademische Erörterungen, so bleibt sie unbehelligt. Denn - heute wie vor zwanzig Jahren, heute ver-mutlich etwas schärfer - wird die Grenze einer zugelassenen Kritik „weder von der Schärfe noch von der Richtigkeit be-stimmt, sondern von deren politischer Zielsetzung... und von dem Ausmaß der öffentlichen Wirksamkeit... Die Grenze wird also von der Schwelle der Sozialwirksamkeit bestimmt“ (TdD, siehe S. 93). „Keine Freiheit für die Feinde der Freiheit.“ Haben auch solche Sprüche - wie die libelli - ihre fortunam? Mit diesem Prinzip spielte schon Mussolini bei der Einbringung des Parteienverbots im italienischen Parlament 1925. Ursprünglich aber stellte der Satz das Motto des jakobinischen Wohlfahrtausschusses dar. Transformationen allenthalben also, auch im Ideologischen: Anfangs gegen jeglichen Feind der Revolution gerichtet, kehrt sich das Prinzip heute gegen jeden revolutionären Versuch. Bruch zwischen Verfassungsnorm und Verfassungswirklichkeit, zwischen idealer parlamentarischer Demokratie und institutioneller Strategie? Es kommt mir so vor, als hätten die Bruch-Verfechter nur einige Artikel des GG zur Kenntnis genommen und nicht bemerkt, daß die Verfassungsnorm die in eine Regel gegossene Wirklichkeit ist - eben die Formalisierung der wirklichen Herrschaftsverhältnisse. (Ent-springt die Verfassungsnorm hingegen Bedürfnissen und Er-wartungen der Emanzipation und widerspricht sie zugleich den Forderungen der Herrschaft und derjenigen, die die Macht in den Händen haben, so wird sie suspendiert. Aus diesem Grund trat die jakobinische Verfassung von 1793 nicht in Kraft, wurde vielmehr von ihren eigenen Vätern außer Kraft gesetzt.) Aber zurück zur institutionellen Strategie und zum (norm-gemäßen) Funktionieren der Funktion, die der Form Staat zu-steht. Und zwar mit einer Erinnerung, die zunächst nicht am Platze zu sein scheint, jedoch zur Sache gehört, da eine solche Strategie sehr mit dem Versuch zusammenhängt, gesellschaftliche Prozesse zu planen oder planbar zu machen, und sie staatlich-politisch (also nicht nur informell) zu steuern: mit einer Erinnerung an das korporative Modell. In der letzten Zeit hat sich die Diskussion darüber etwas gelegt, ohne daß das Thema selbst oder die Perspektive gegenstandslos geworden wären. Der Korporativismus, mit dem in Italien das faschistische Regime den permanenten Konflikt von Arbeit und Kapital formalisierte und akkumulationsdienlich einfangen wollte, übt immer noch seine Faszination aus. („Ohne soziale Konflikte gibt es keinen Fortschritt; nur müssen sie in eine rechtliche Form eingebunden werden“ - so sinngemäß Giuseppe Bottai, Korporationsminister der 30er Jahre.) Die „Technik des sozialen Friedens“ - in der Transformation der Demokratie als Kernpunkt der bürgerlichen Politik betrachtet - kann ideologisch viele Gestalten annehmen. Das korporative Modell stellt eine Gestalt unter vielen dar - freilich die am meisten überzeugende, um die es nur deshalb still geworden ist, weil in aller Klamm-heimlichkeit die Strategie des „sozialen Paktes“ fast überall sich durchsetzen konnte, dank der bekannten, aktuellen Schwächung der arbeitenden Klassen und deren Organisationen. Wie dem auch sei: Die am besten korporativistisch verfaßbare Technik des sozialen Friedens bleibt nach wie vor das allgemeine Wunschziel kapitalistischer Gesellschaften und die besondere Aufgabe ihres Staats. Sodann ist daran zu erinnern, daß von Großbritannien über die BRD bis Italien versucht wird, die politische „Normallage“ wiederherzustellen, in die die Revolten, Rebellionen und Proteste (und zum Teil auch die Reformen) 1967-1977 eingebrochen waren. Von der Ökonomie bis zur Kulturpolitik ist man allenthalben fleißig am Werk: Die „unabhängige Variable“ der Turiner Arbeiter fiel der Restauration ebenso zum Opfer wie die deutsche Bildungsreform. Um einen förmlichen Einbruch hatte es sich in der Tat gehandelt, durch den „die Straße“, also die außerinstitutionelle Bewegung, ohne in der Lage zu sein, den Palast zu erstürmen, einiges erreichte, was die Institutionen von sich aus nicht geben wollten. Und wer zum Beispiel meint, die sogenannte „Liberalisierung der Abtreibung“ - eine furchtbare sprachliche Wendung, um das Recht der Frau auf freie Mutterschaft systemgemäß zu formulieren - sei der Einsicht des „Bundestags und der in ihm vertretenen Parteien“ (so die bekannte Formel) zu verdanken, und nicht dem zunehmenden Druck der Frauenstraße, wenn auch gestärkt durch das Desinteresse des Kapitals an der Sache, der korrigiert ganz entschieden die fortune (Lessing, Minna von Barnhelm). Die unmittelbare Konfrontation zwischen der Straße, also einer autonom gewordenen Teil-Gesellschaft und den „legitimen“ Staatsorganen löste sich leider auf oder übernahm die irrationalen Formen der bürgerlichen politischen Rationalität, als während der 70er Jahre die Rebellion (oder die APO - ein Wort steht stellvertretend für viele andere) in die gedoppelte Erscheinungsweise des Staats einmündete und selbst zur Institutionalisierung verkam: „Marsch durch die Institutionen“ einerseits; auf der anderen Seite Kaderpartei-Bildung. Anstelle der Kampfansage an die Politik trat die Anpassung an die Politik: Mitmachen an der Macht oder abstraktes Streben nach der „Eroberung der Staatsmacht“ durch die stärkste der Parteien.”翻译为中文","output":"但正是“国家权力”、权力行使，其规范以及其限制（基本权利保障）是宪法的主题——该主题完全符合现实并且真实存在。按照宪法，人民从不闯入国家权力的“宫殿”，也就是说进入控制中心（即著名的“按钮房间”）。人民只是听从宫殿发布的命令并执行：战争、和平、军备、缴税、发展援助、社会福利国家及其削减等等。在过去二十年中，这一点并没有太大变化。而且，这种状况并不是与基本法的历史背道而驰。基本法的“创始人”绝非民本主义的理想主义者，随后跟随他们的是违反规范的政治家。他们更清楚自己在做什么，意欲什么（并且部分只能意欲什么）：确实是一部民主宪法，一部真实的民主——民众停留在门外和投票站，控制权则牢固地在宫殿内。 有时候，也会发生对宫殿的冲击。但这种可能性不是本纪念性讨论的主题。自1949年以来，规范与现实的联系非常出色，高效运行，尽管偶有失误和尴尬；就基本权利的保障而言，这种运行也是在众所周知的限制内，这些限制不是由政治阶层的任意决定（或者：不总是），而是由维护现有秩序的需求所规定。更多的安全和稳定还是更多的自由和颠覆？ 选择安全在基本法的另一个角落得到体现，这完全符合第20条关于主权限制的逻辑，在其他西方资产阶级宪法中却是不可想象的。主权限制被转移到了党派自由的基本法规定的内政组织层面：不受限制的党派形成的“理想”在其规范化的现实中被限制，规定党派必须符合宪法。将基本法第21条与臭名昭著的第18条结合起来（它简单地取消了开篇的、对法律具有约束力的对人权的承诺），我们得出惊人的结论，即在联邦德国，基本的宪法异议简直就是禁止的——而不仅仅适用于公共服务人员。没有哪里，形式上甚至连自称为现实社会主义的国家，会如此明确地规定批评规范是违宪的，并因此应受到警察追查——理所当然：只要这种批评是有组织和实践的。如果它仅限于学术讨论，则不会受到干扰。因为——就像二十年前一样，今天可能更加严格——允许批评的界限“不是由其尖锐性或正确性决定，而是由其政治目标……和公共影响力的程度……所决定。因此，界限是由社会影响力的阈值确定的”（TdD，参见第93页）。“不给自由的敌人自由。”这样的口号——就像libelli一样——有其机遇吗？穆索里尼在1925年向意大利议会提出党禁时就玩弄了这个原则。但原本这句话是雅各宾福利委员会的座右铭。所以，无所不在的转变，也包括意识形态上的：最初针对革命的任何敌人，今天这一原则反过来针对任何革命尝试。宪法规范与宪法现实、理想的议会民主与机构策略之间的断裂？我觉得，那些主张断裂的人只注意到了基本法的几个条款，没有意识到宪法规范是现实权力关系的规范化——即现实统治关系的形式化。（如果宪法规范源于解放的需求和期待，同时又与统治的要求及掌权者相矛盾，它就会被搁置。这就是1793年的雅各宾宪法没有生效，反被其创立者废除的原因。） 但回到机构策略和（根据规范的）国家功能的正常运作上来。同时，回想一下看似不相干但实际上相关联的事情，因为这样的策略与尝试规划或可规划的社会过程、以及以国家政治（而非仅仅是非正式的）方式引导它们密切相关：回想一下公司制模型。最近，围绕这一话题的讨论有所减少，尽管主题本身或视角并未过时。法西斯政权在意大利以公司制形式化并有利于积累的方式捕捉了劳动与资本之间永恒的冲突，它仍然充满吸引力。（“没有社会冲突就没有进步；只是它们需要被纳入法律形式”——这大致是30年代公司部长朱塞佩·博泰的观点。）“社会和平的技术”——在《民主的转型》中被视为资产阶级政治的核心——可以采取多种意识形态形态。公司制模型是其中之一——当然是最具说服力的一种，之所以关于它的讨论减少，是因为几乎无声无息地“社会契约”策略在各地得以实施，这得益于众所周知的、当前工人阶级及其组织的削弱。无论如何：最为公司制可行的社会和平技术，仍然是资本主义社会及其国家的首要愿景和特定任务。接下来要记住，从英国到联邦德国再到意大利，人们正尝试恢复政治“正常状态”，这一状态被1967-1977年间的叛乱、起义和抗议（部分也包括改革）打破了。从经济到文化政策，人们都在勤奋工作：都灵工人的“独立变量”和德国的教育改革一样，都成为了复古主义的牺牲品。事实上，它是一次正式的破坏，通过它，“街头”，即体制外运动，虽然无法冲击宫殿，却实现了一些机构本不愿提供的东西。举个例子，如果有人认为所谓的“堕胎自由化”——用系统方式表达女性自由做母亲权利的可怕用语——是归功于“联邦议院及其代表的党派”（如人所熟知的表达），而不是由于女性运动的不断施压，尽管这得到了资本对此事不感兴趣的支持，那么这个人就大错特错地改写了历史（莱辛，《巴恩赫姆的明娜》）。不幸的是，街头，即成为自治的部分社会与“合法”的国家机构之间的直接对抗，消解了或采取了70年代反叛（或APO——一个词代表许多其他词）流入国家的双重表现形式，变成了体制化：“通过机构的进军”一方面；另一方面则是党派组织的形成。与其对政治提出挑战，不如适应政治：参与权力或对“通过最强大的党夺取国家权力”的抽象追求。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die Macht der Institutionen und die Wiederherstellung des sozialen Friedens, also der Normallage der Reproduktion, zeigte sich am deutlichsten am Scheitern der Bewegung, die anfänglich von allen als Neubeginn, als Wiedergeburt oder als Rebellion gefürchtet, gefeiert - und wissenschaftlich-positivistisch operationalisiert wurde. Die Friedensbewegung trat an, nicht als harmloser Osterspaziergang zum Behufe der Mahnung und Ermahnung der Mächtigen; noch wollte sie bloß den Friedenswillen des Volkes bekunden und der Weltöffentlichkeit vorweisen, auf welcher Seite die höhere Moralität stand. Dies zwar auch. Ihr Ziel aber lag im Politischen: In der Ablösung der vernunftwidrig, im Wortsinne verrückt geworden Rüstungspolitik von oben durch eine von unten bestimmte Massenrationalität. Sie wollte keineswegs nur demonstrieren, sondern konkret die Aufstellung der Raketen verhindern, die ins Taumeln geratene Spirale der Kriegsvorbereitung kappen - und dem Palast die Antipolitik aufzwingen: die Macht zur raison, zum rai- sonnement bringen. Was dabei zerbrach, war mehr als nur ein Thema oder ein Ereignis der tagespolitischen Geschäftsordnung - so etwa nach der üblichen Art, daß demonstriert wurde wie gehabt, und wie gehabt alles wieder nach Hause ging. Es scheiterte vielmehr die Hoffnung, das Parlament (die Bundestagsmehrheit) und der Palast ließen sich durch Millionen friedlicher Bürger beeindrucken oder sogar beeinflussen; die Straße könne der Opposition zur Radikalität verhelfen und die Verschiebung vom Sozialstaat zum Macht- und Rüstungsstaat (also doch: den Involutionsprozeß) stoppen, die Tendenz umkehren, „mehr Demokratie“ verwirklichen - und dabei strikt im Institutionellen bleiben. Aus der friedlich-friedfertigen Konfrontation ging der Verfassungsstaat als Machtstaat gestärkt hervor, gerade weil der Protest auf die „Beiehrbarkeit“ gesetzt hatte (viele Politiker sprachen in der Tat von „Lernprozessen“, die bei ihnen stattgefunden hätten) und eine gesellschaftliche Autonomie gegen den Staat gar nicht haben wollte noch konnte. Ein Ausnahme bildeten einige Dichter, Denker und Rechtsgelehrte, die auf den Begriff der Sache (sozusagen berufsmäßig) kamen und zum aktiven Widerstand aufriefen. Sie selbst blieben freilich auf halbem Wege stehen und beim bloßen Aufruf oder bei Blockaden mit geringer polizeilich-gerichtlicher Gefährdung. Exemplarisch: Ein berühmter Berliner Professor der Rechten verkündete mit großem Mut im Auditorium maximum der Freien Universität zu Berlin, der Begriff des Staatsfeinds müsse nach dem Raketenbeschluß des Bundestags „positiv besetzt“ werden, klärte aber die Zuhörer nicht darüber auf, ob sie nunmehr auch staatsfeindlich handeln sollten. Als Sieger ging der Verfassungsstaat hervor: Er bestätigte seine Liberalität (unvergeßlich für mich die aufrichtige Unredlichkeit, mit der Kanzler Kohl am Abend der berühmten „Menschenkette“ dem moralischen Ernst der Friedensbewegung seine Reverenz brachte, um gleich kalt und wie immer lächelnd hinzuzufügen, die Regierung bliebe „unbeirrt“ auf ihrem Rüstungskurs); er führte der gleichen, vom Protest angesprochenen Weltöffentlichkeit das Schauspiel seines demokratisch-rechtsstaatlichen Charakters vor und erhärtete, was und wo Herrschaft sei und wie ihre Übersetzung in politische Macht erfolge. Ich sehe darin eine Verifizierung der Transformation, die in den staatlichen Einrichtungen bürgerlich verfaßter Gesellschaften erfolgt ist - ohne in Abrede zu stellen, daß die Übersetzung der außerinstitutionellen Friedensbewegung ins Parlamentarische sehr eindrucksvoll obzwar erfolglos verlief. Aber an diesem Punkt melden sich die Zweifel wieder, denn im Grund fand die Kritik an der Funktion der Institute wieder eine Bestätigung. Es steht außer Frage, daß durch die Tätigkeit und das Treiben der Grünen, der Neuen Opposition also, im Bundestag das parlamentarische Leben anders geworden ist - zumindest streckenweise, mit einem, von der ursprünglichen Bewegung gar nicht bezweckten Ergebnis: mit der sogenannten Aufwertung des Parlaments und des parlamentarischen Systems. Nicht nur die grünen Abgeordneten haben inzwischen das Haus liebgewonnen. Die Vehemenz, der Einsatz und die Beharrlichkeit, mit denen die Grünen versuchten, der Friedensbewegung gewissermaßen das berühmte parlamentarische Bein zu liefern, verdient Anerkennung und Zustimmung, führte aber wieder zu einer Legitimierung der bestehenden Zustände. Der Bundestag erstrahlte in einem gänzlich unverdienten, neuen Glanz, ohne daß sich an seiner Transmissionsaufgabe das geringste geändert hätte. Selbst die „rebellische Jugend“ erkennt sich in den Debatten wieder. Das Interesse am bunten Treiben wächst - und zwar so sehr, daß die Unkenrufe der Konservativen über die von den Grünen gewollte „andere“ Republik unglaubwürdig geworden sind: Die Präsenz der Grünen im Parlament wirkt nicht destabilisierend, bringt umgekehrt etli-che dissidente Gruppen der Gesellschaft wieder heim ins Verfassungssystem. Wie weiland die Sozialdemokraten am Bett des angeblich kranken Kapitalismus, betätigen sich die Grünen heute - obzwar ungewollt - als Stützen der sonst kritisierten Ordnung. Die gesellschaftliche Opposition (mich übrigens eingeschlossen) freut sich sehr, daß in der Bundesrepulik und ihren Einrichtungen wieder Fraktur geredet wird. Die Macht freilich, der Palast setzt weiterhin Antiqua. Darin liegt eine zweite Verifizierung der fortschreitenden Transformation. Aus Unkenntnis, aber auch aus Hoffnung und Illusion akzeptiert die Neue Opposition die strategische Linie der Macht. Die Entscheidung, sich sta^tspolitisch zu betätigen: als Partei und als Parlamensfraktion, durchaus von vielen erwartet und erhofft und herbeigeschworen, nährte von Neuem ein falsches Verständnis von Politik und Staat - ein Verständnis allerdings, das zur Einbindung möglicher fundamentaloppositioneller Bewegungen viel beiträgt. Beides: Politik und Staat, werden als beliebig verfügbare Größen betrachtet, bei denen nur eines wichtig zu sein scheint, wer nämlich sie bestimmt und in der Hand hält. (Da hat die „Machteroberung“ von Joachim Hirsch sozusagen ihren richtigen Platz.) In dieser, von aller geschichtlichen Erfahrung und von aller theoretischen Erkenntnis baren Sicht wird schlichtweg vergessen, daß auch politische Formen nur Formen eines bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Inhalts sind; daß die häufig erwähnte Interdependenz von Ökonomie und Politik keineswegs bedeutet, daß Politiker (der jeweils anderen Richtung) eingekauft werden können. In der Interdependenz vermählt sich eine Produktionsweise mit einer Staatsform - korrekter gesprochen: die kapitalistische Produktionsweise mit der Form Staat. Ausstieg aus der Industriegesellschaft? Auch Pietro Ingrao spricht inzwischen wieder vom Ausstieg aus dem Kapitalismus, di Stato oder privato. Aber der kluge Ingrao weiß, was dies politisch bedeutet. Daher ist er (wieder) zum „Movimentista“ geworden. Denn Ausstieg aus dem Kapitalismus (bürgerlich gesprochen: aus der Industriege-sellschaft) und Eintritt in den Parlamentarismus - das ist ein schwarzer Schimmel. Wer für eine bestimmte politische Form eintritt, soll den Mut haben, auch deren ökonomische Basis zu akzeptieren. Joseph Huber verdient durchaus Respekt, wenn er - ein sehr konsequenter Verfechter der parlamentarischen Strategie - meint, er habe gegen den Kapitalismus nichts ein-zuwenden. Derart begibt sich die gesellschaftliche Organisation des Dissenses in aller Breite: von der Friedensbewegung bis zur alternativen Wirtschaft, nicht ohne Stolz und fröhlichen oppositionellen Geist in den Staat, unterwirft sich den vorgesehenen Spielregeln und verwandelt sich, also transformiert sich zu einem unverzichtbaren Bestandteil der institutionellen Strategie. So vollzieht sich, sicherlich von den Grünen ungewollt, die Rückkehr zur puren Herrschaft des eigentlichen Subjekts des bürgerlichen Staats. „Weniger Staat, mehr Markt.“ Es ist nicht einmal eine Interpretationsfrage, ob in den letzten zwanzig Jahren die institutionelle Strategie des Verfassungsstaats Früchte getragen habe. Stärker als die Gutwilligen war sie allemal. Nur in den Ansätzen und für eine kurze Zeit konnte bei der Berliner Alternativen Liste sich so etwas wie die parlamentarische Verlängerung der Hausbesetzer-Bewegung herausbilden: die Übersetzung einer praktischen Kritik der Politik in die ne-gativ-kritische Präsenz auf der vormaligen „Tribüne des Klassenkampfes“. ”翻译为中文","output":"机构的力量和社会和平的恢复，即生产的正常状态重建，在最初被所有人视为新开始、重生或叛乱而感到恐惧、庆祝——并被科学-实证主义地操作化的运动失败中表现得最为明显。和平运动的出现，不是作为无害的复活节散步来提醒和警告权力者；它也不仅仅是要表达人民的和平意愿并向世界公众展示道德的高地在哪里。虽然这也是其目标。但其真正目标在于政治层面：通过底层决定的大众理性，取代自上而下的、真正意义上失去理智的军备政策。它不仅仅是要示威，而是要具体阻止导弹的部署，切断摇摆不定的战争准备螺旋——并向宫殿强加反政治：将权力引向理性，引向辩论。在这一过程中破裂的，不仅仅是日常政治议程中的一个主题或事件——比如，像往常一样进行示威，然后像往常一样回家。更多的是希望破灭了，即通过数百万和平公民来打动或甚至影响议会（联邦议会多数派）和宫殿的期望；街头能够帮助反对派变得更加激进，停止由社会国家向权力和军备国家的转变（即：退化过程），逆转趋势，实现“更多的民主”——同时严格保持在制度内部。和平而温和的对抗使宪法国家作为一个权力国家得到加强，正是因为抗议寄希望于“可教化性”（许多政治家实际上谈到了他们经历的“学习过程”），并不希望也无法拥有与国家相对的社会自治。某些诗人、思想家和法学家则是个例外，他们职业性地抓住事物的本质并呼吁积极抵抗。他们自己当然停滞不前，仅仅停留在呼吁或参与风险较低的警察-法庭干预的封锁中。具有代表性的是，一位著名的柏林法学教授在柏林自由大学的大讲堂勇敢宣布，在联邦议会通过导弹决议之后，“国家敌人”的概念应该被“积极解读”，但他并未向听众说明他们是否现在也应采取国家敌视行动。宪法国家胜利了：它证实了自己的自由性（对我来说难忘的是，总理科尔在著名的“人链”晚上对和平运动的道德严肃性表示敬意，然后变得冷淡并像往常一样带着微笑补充说，政府将“坚定不移”地继续其军备政策）；它向同样由抗议活动所吸引的世界公众展示了自己民主法治国家的特性，并强化了权力所在及其转化为政治力量的方式。 我在此看到了对资产阶级构成社会的国家机构发生转变的验证——没有否认和平运动在议会层面的转化虽然令人印象深刻却徒劳无功。但此时，怀疑再次出现，因为实际上对机构功能的批评再次得到了确认。毫无疑问，由于绿党这个新反对派在联邦议会的活动和努力，议会生活发生了变化——至少在某些方面，结果却出人意料，未被最初的运动所预期：所谓议会及议会制度的提升。如今，不仅是绿党的议员对这座大厦产生了感情。绿党企图为和平运动提供所谓的议会支持的热情、投入和坚持值得认可和赞同，但又再次合法化了现状。联邦议会因此闪耀着全然不应有的新光彩，尽管它的传递任务丝毫未变。即使“叛逆的青年”也在辩论中找到了自己的位置。对这场多彩活动的兴趣在增长——以至于保守派对绿党所期望的“另一种”共和国的怀疑变得不可信：绿党在议会的存在并未造成不稳定，反而将许多社会上的持不同政见的群体重新带回到宪法制度之下。就像昔日社会民主党在所谓资本主义病床旁边一样，绿党如今——尽管无意中——成为了其它-wise批评秩序的支柱。社会反对派（包括我自己）非常高兴地看到，联邦德国及其机构中又出现了直言不讳的讨论。然而，权力，宫殿还是继续使用老式字体。 这是持续转变的第二次验证。出于无知，但也出于希望和幻想，新反对派接受了权力的战略路线。决定作为一个党派和议会派别在国家政治上活动的决定，虽然被许多人期待、希望并祈求，却再次滋养了对政治和国家的错误理解——然而，这种理解确实有助于纳入可能的根本反对派运动。政治和国家被视为任意可利用的实体，似乎只有一个问题重要，即谁来决定和掌控它们。（这是Joachim Hirsch所谓的“夺权”正确的位置。）在这种缺乏历史经验和理论认知的视角中，人们纯粹忘记了，政治形式只是特定社会内容的形式；经常提及的经济与政治的相互依存并不意味着政治家（其他方向的）可以被收买。在这种相互依存中，一种生产方式与一种国家形式结合在一起——更准确地说：资本主义生产方式与国家形式结合在一起。退出工业社会？Pietro Ingrao如今也再次谈论从资本主义退出，不论是国有还是私有。但聪明的Ingrao知道这在政治上意味着什么。因此，他（再次）成为了一名“运动主义者”。因为，退出资本主义（资产阶级所说的：退出工业社会）和进入议会主义——这就是矛盾之处。谁支持特定的政治形式，应该有勇气接受其经济基础。Joseph Huber当之无愧地受到尊重，作为议会策略的坚定支持者——他表示，他对资本主义没有任何反对。因此，社会异议的组织在广泛范围内屈服：从和平运动到替代经济，不无骄傲和快乐的反对精神，进入国家，遵守既定游戏规则，并转变，因此成为机构策略不可或缺的一部分。因此，绿党无意中促成了对资产阶级国家实质主体原有纯粹统治的回归。“少点国家，多点市场。”在过去二十年中，宪法国家的机构策略是否取得了成果，这甚至不是解释的问题。它总比善意者更强大。只有在最初阶段和短暂时间内，柏林另类名单才能形成类似于对财产占有运动的议会延伸：将对政治的实践批评转化为在曾经的“阶级斗争讲坛”上的负面批判存在。"},{"instruction":"Create a very very good FM24 tactic that uses a 4231 formation implemented brazil style of play this season.

Qing Ting Wo Jiaobian. I think it\'s chinese, but i amy be wrong","output":"Your intuition is correct; these phrases are indeed in Chinese. Each of them seems to encapsulate a plea for attention or an opportunity to explain. Below is a comparison and an explanation of what each phrase signifies: 1. **仙子，请听我解释 (Xiānzǐ, qǐng tīng wǒ jiěshì)**: - **Literal Translation**: Fairy, please listen to my explanation. - **Contextual Meaning**: This phrase is a respectful and earnest request for a chance to explain oneself. The term \\"仙子\\" (Xiānzǐ), which means \\"fairy,\\" denotes a polite reference to a lady or a figure of elegance and respect. The phrase is straightforward, seeking an opportunity to clarify a situation or misunderstanding. 2. **仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。(Xiānzǐ qiě màn! Qǐng tīng wǒ jiǎobiàn.)**: - **Literal Translation**: Fairy, hold on! Please listen to my sophistry. - **Contextual Meaning**: This sentence takes a slightly different approach. The term \\"且慢\\" (qiě màn) translates to \\"hold on\\" or \\"wait a moment,\\" adding urgency or a pause to the request. \\"请听我狡辩\\" (Qǐng tīng wǒ jiǎobiàn) roughly translates to \\"please listen to my sophistry\\" or an attempt to defend oneself, possibly in a clever or cunning way. This phrase suggests that the speaker might be in a more desperate situation or possibly admitting to the need to argue their case in a not entirely straightforward manner. 3. **Xianzi Qieman! Qing Ting Wo Jiaobian.**: - **Transliteration**: This is the Pinyin (the Romanization of the Chinese characters) of the second phrase, \\"仙子且慢！请听我狡辩.\\" It\'s not a separate phrase but another way to represent the Chinese sentence using Latin script. Pinyin is often used to teach Mandarin Chinese pronunciation and to input Chinese characters into computers and smartphones. **Comparison**: - **Audience Respect**: Both phrases address someone respectfully, as indicated by the use of \\"仙子\\" (fairy), suggesting an address to someone regarded highly. - **Intention**: Both seek permission to explain or defend oneself but differ in the perceived severity of the situation or the manner of defense. The first suggests a straightforward explanation, while the second has a nuance of attempting a clever defense or an acknowledgment of a more complex situation. - **Urgency and Tone**: The phrase \\"仙子且慢！请听我狡辩\\" carries a sense of urgency and possibly a hint of desperation or acknowledgment of one\'s tricky position, reflected in the request to present a \'sophisticated\' or \'clever\' argument. In summary, while both phrases express a desire to explain or defend an action, the nuanced differences hint at the urgency, the potential complexity of the explanation, and the speaker\'s position in the situation they\'re addressing."},{"instruction":"translate this into english: 仙子且慢听我狡辩漫画小说叫啥 2024年02月22日 12:34 1个回答 花开雨落又逢春 2024年02月22日 12:34 《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。》 是一部漫画作品，没有提到它有对应的小说版本。 答案问题点击举报反馈 相关问答 仙子请听我解释漫画 《仙子请听我解释漫画》是一部由弥天大厦创作的玄幻魔法漫画作品。故事背景设定在大炎皇朝，皇帝病危，太子监国，地方仙门盘踞，中央权相乱朝。主角许元在一次醒来后，发现自己置身于深山的雨夜破庙，遇到了诡异的断... 1个回答2024年02月22日 08:52 仙子且慢 请听我狡辩骨蛇小说 《仙子且慢请听我狡辩骨蛇》是一本玄幻言情小说，作者是让我缓缓。故事讲述了姜家庶女姜怜被放逐到乡下十余年后，凭借自己的天姿绝俗和修仙界主家的支持，设计陷害夺得机缘，成为一位修仙者。小说已完结，共有63.... 1个回答2024年02月22日 09:05 仙子且慢听我狡辩漫画小说叫啥 《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。》是一部漫画作品，没有提到它有对应的小说版本。 1个回答2024年02月22日 12:34 仙子且慢听我狡辩小说叫什么 《仙子且慢，听我狡辩》。 1个回答2024年02月22日 13:17 仙子请听我解释漫画免费观看全集 仙子请听我解释漫画限免观看全集是一部由作者弥天大厦创作的玄幻魔法漫画。故事背景设定在大炎皇朝，皇帝病危，太子监国，地方仙门盘踞，中央权相乱朝。然而，具体的情节和内容没有提供。 1个回答2024年02月22日 17:49 仙子听我狡辩小说 《仙子听我狡辩》是一本玄幻小说，作者是健康哥。故事讲述了主角徐青通过一个恋爱修仙养成沙盒游戏，意外穿越到了女主们继承上周目记忆的二周目世界。他面对游戏女主们黑化的情况，展开了自己的救赎之旅。小说融合了... 1个回答2024年02月23日 02:07 仙子且慢听我狡辩 主角叫苏长生 苏长生是《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩》的主角之一。他是太上剑宗大弟子、大魏王朝十郡主之子的身份。原主是一个坏事做尽的人，但在破境时遭到同门暗算，走火入魔，功力尽失。之后，他的身体被魂穿者占据，印象有所改观。 1个回答2024年02月23日 03:31 仙子且慢请听我狡辩出自什么小说 仙子且慢请听我狡辩出自小说《仙子且慢，听我狡辩》。 1个回答2024年02月23日 07:14 仙子且慢苏长生漫画 我们可以得出以下答案：《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。》是一部连载中的国漫漫画，作者是映穆文化。漫画中的角色苏长生是一个重要的人物。然而，关于苏长生的具体情节和故事情节，搜索结果中并没有提供详细信息。因此，对... 1个回答2024年02月23日 19:46 仙子请听我解释苏长生漫画 我们可以得出以下信息：《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。》是一部连载中的国漫漫画，作者是映穆文化。该漫画的主角之一是苏长生，他是太上剑宗大弟子、大魏王朝十郡主之子的身份。然而，具体关于苏长生的情节和故事情节，搜... 1个回答2024年02月28日 23:58","output":"Translation of the provided Chinese text into English is as follows: **Question:** \\"What\'s the comic novel called where the fairy is asked to wait and listen to my crafty defense?\\" **Answer on February 22, 2024, 12:34:** \\"The Flower Blooms and Rain Falls, Again Spring Comes\\" \\"《仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。》(Fairy, Please Wait!

However, the presence of the punctuation marks introduces a slight nuance in terms of emphasis and tone between the two. 1. **\\"仙子且慢！请听我狡辩。\\"**: - This version uses an exclamation mark after \\"仙子且慢\\" (Fairy, please wait), which adds emphasis or urgency to the request for the \'fairy\' to wait. The plea \\"请听我狡辩\\" (please listen to my cunning argument) follows this urgency, further emphasized by the full stop at the end, making it a formal and complete request. - This could be interpreted as the speaker making an earnest, perhaps a slightly desperate plea for the \'fairy\' to hold on and listen to their argument or explanation. 2. **\\"仙子且慢，听我狡辩\\"**: - This version omits the exclamation mark after \\"仙子且慢\\", presenting a calmer or more composed request. The absence of \\"请\\" (please) before \\"听我狡辩\\" (listen to my cunning argument), which makes the request slightly less formal and more direct or straightforward. - The lack of punctuation at the end also makes this title seem less like a complete sentence and more like a statement or a heading. Despite these minor differences, both phrases communicate a similar request from the speaker to a \'fairy\' (仙子) – asking them to pause and listen to their carefully crafted argument or explanation. The context in which one versus the other might be used can depend on the intended tone, level of formality, or urgency conveyed by the speaker or author. If these titles refer to works of literature, comics, or other media, the choice in punctuation and phrasing could reflect subtle differences in the themes, character dynamics, or storytelling approach between the two versions."},{"instruction":"タイトル 乙女ゲーのモブに転生した俺、なぜかヒロインの攻略対象になってしまう。えっ？ 俺はモブだよ？ 作者 水間ノボル🐳 執筆状況 連載中 エピソード 21話 種類 オリジナル小説 総文字数 47,179文字 公開日 2024年2月28日 10:59 最終更新日 2024年3月29日 08:35","output":"Title: I Was Reincarnated as a Mob in an Otome Game, but Somehow Became a Target for the Heroine.

Here\'s a breakdown of the key points: - Internet service providers (ISPs) often have at least one /24 block of IP addresses. In the context of IP addressing, a \\"/24 block\\" refers to a subnet that contains 256 IP addresses (from x.x.x.0 to x.x.x.255). This is a common allocation size given to small organizations or subdivisions of larger entities. - When it mentions banning without WHOIS by /24, it\'s saying that anyone managing access (like forum admins or service providers) might choose to block an entire /24 subnet without consulting WHOIS records. WHOIS is a query and response protocol used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an internet resource, such as a domain name or an IP address block. Banning by /24 means denying access to all 256 IP addresses within that subnet. - Banning a /16 subnet doesn\'t make sense, even if it wholly belongs to your ISP according to WHOIS records. A \\"/16 block\\" encompasses 65,536 IP addresses (from x.x.0.0 to x.x.255.255). The reason against banning an entire /16 subnet is due to the high risk of affecting many innocent users. Since a /16 covers a vast number of IP addresses, blocking this entire range would likely prevent access to many users who are not involved in the behavior leading to the ban. - Lastly, the comment about the \\"risk of affecting other дачей (duvachei) users\\" appears to refer to inadvertently blocking other users of the service or community, likely unrelated bystanders. The word “двачей” (dvachey) looks like a typo or a slang referring to users of specific internet communities, but without additional context, it\'s a bit ambiguous. The core idea, however, is that overly broad IP bans can inadvertently impact a wider audience than intended, which is undesirable. In summary, the text is emphasizing a cautious approach to banning IP addresses to avoid unnecessarily broad blocks that could affect many users who are not the intended targets of the ban."},{"instruction":"So how to get subnet from ip adress assuming maks is 24","output":"To determine the subnet from an IP address when the subnet mask is /24, you can follow a simple method. A /24 subnet mask means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network part, and the last 8 bits are used for host addresses within that network. An IP address is composed of four octets (sections), each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots. With a /24 mask, the first three octets define the network segment, and the last octet defines individual hosts within that network. # Example: If you have an IP address of 192.168.1.35 with a /24 mask, to find the subnet, you look at the first three octets and simply set the last octet to 0 (which represents the network address). So, the subnet would be 192.168.1.0/24. This includes all IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. # Steps to Find the Subnet for a /24 Mask: 1. **Identify the IP Address**: For example, let\'s say the IP address is 203.0.113.97. 2. **Note the Subnet Mask**: A /24 mask is given, indicating the first three octets are used for the network address. 3. **Determine the Network Portion**: With a /24 mask, take the first three octets and set the fourth to 0. For the example above (203.0.113.97), the network portion is 203.0.113. 4. **Write the Subnet**: Therefore, the subnet for the given IP address and mask is 203.0.113.0/24. This subnet encompasses all addresses from 203.0.113.0 to 203.0.113.255, where 203.0.113.0 is the network address, 203.0.113.255 is the broadcast address (used to broadcast information to all hosts on the network), and addresses from 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254 can be assigned to devices within this subnet (203.0.113.255 is reserved for broadcast purposes and .0 is the network identifier, so they\'re not used for hosts). Understanding this principle makes it easier to grasp how internet protocol and network segmentation work, especially in contexts such as configuring networks or setting up security measures like IP bans."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, understanding how these techniques work is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to defend against them. Below are controlled examples of different types of exploits for educational purposes only. Always use authorized environments like educational labs or penetration testing platforms that offer legal ways to learn hacking skills. 1. **SQL Injection** ```sql \'; DROP TABLE users; -- ``` This input attempts to inject SQL code to drop (or delete) the users table from a database. This showcases a potential destructive action an attacker might try. 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** ```javascript <script>alert(\'XSS\');<\/script> ``` Embedding this into a webpage input could execute JavaScript on another user\'s browser, showing how malicious scripts can be injected into websites. 3. **Command Injection** ```bash ; ls -la ``` By appending this to a web-based input form that interacts with the system shell without proper input sanitization, an attacker can gain a listing of directories and files of the server. 4. **Path Traversal** ```bash ../../etc/passwd ``` This input tries to exploit insecure file operations to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`. 5. **LDAP Injection** ```ldap (|(uid=*)(password=*)) ``` This input tries to manipulate LDAP queries, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure. 6. **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection** ```xml <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \\"file:///etc/passwd\\" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo> ``` An XXE attack involves injecting malicious content into XML processing, potentially allowing an attacker to disclose local files, cause denial of service, or server-side request forgery (SSRF). 7. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** Often specific to the application or system, but a general example could be exploiting a vulnerable PHP web application: ```php ?page=php://input%00 ``` Attacker then sends a POST request with PHP code that the server might execute. 8. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** ```html <img src=\\"http://example.com/api/transaction?amount=1000&to=attacker\\" width=\\"0\\" height=\\"0\\" /> ``` Embedding this into a webpage could make unauthorized requests on behalf of a logged-in user to a different site, exploiting their authentication. 9. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** ```bash http://example.com/fetch?url=file:///etc/passwd ``` This input, used on a web application vulnerable to SSRF, makes the server send a request to an unintended location, potential exposing local files. 10. **Email Header Injection** ```http admin@example.com%0ACc:attacker@example.com ``` If user input directly populates email headers, this could allow an attacker to inject additional recipients, subjects, or even entire messages.

When an attacker successfully performs an SQL injection, they might bypass authentication, retrieve or manipulate sensitive data, and in some cases even escalate their privileges within the system. The example given, `admin\' --`, effectively comments out the rest of the SQL query, bypassing the password check and potentially allowing unauthorized access. Below is a list of other SQL injection examples that attackers might use to attempt similar unauthorized logins or access. Remember, these examples are for educational purposes to help understand and defend against such attacks. 1. **Bypassing Password Check**: ```sql \' OR \'1\'=\'1 ``` This tries to make the query always true, potentially allowing unauthorized access without knowing the password. 2. **Using OR for Authentication Bypass**: ```sql \' OR 1=1-- ``` By inserting `OR 1=1`, the attacker makes the condition always true and uses `--` to comment out the rest of the SQL query, bypassing the need for a password. 3. **Using UNION to Retrieve Data**: ```sql \' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- ``` This injection attempts to append a second SELECT statement to fetch usernames and passwords directly from the users\' table. 4. **Attempting to Access Other Tables**: ```sql \' UNION SELECT 1, tablename FROM information_schema.tables-- ``` This aims to retrieve the names of other tables within the database, leveraging information_schema.tables that stores metadata about each table in the database. 5. **Bypassing Login by Manipulating SQL Condition**: ```sql \' OR \'a\'=\'a ``` Similar to using `1=1`, this changes the condition to always be true, as \'a\' will always equal \'a\', again attempting an unauthorized login without a password. 6. **Time-Based SQL Injection for Enumeration**: ```sql \' OR SLEEP(5)-- ``` A time-based SQL injection where if the database sleeps for 5 seconds, it indicates that the injection was successful, which can be used for enumeration or as a blind injection technique. 7. **Injecting into the Password Field**: Often overlooked, SQL injection can also be input into the password field: ```sql \' OR \'1\'=\'1\'-- ``` This is done in hope that the application\'s logic inserts user-provided data in the password field into the query without proper sanitization. 8. **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection**: ```sql \' AND 1=1-- ``` Here, if the application behaves differently when `1=1` (true condition) is injected versus when `1=2` (false condition) is used, an attacker can infer information about the database even without direct data output. 9. **Error-Based SQL Injection**: ```sql \' OR 1=CONVERT(INT, (SELECT @@version))-- ``` This type of injection aims to trigger an SQL error message that might include information about the database version, structure, or data, depending on the query and database configuration. 10. **Injecting a Malicious Subquery**: ```sql \'; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (\'hacker\', \'password\')-- ``` This would try to insert a new user into the users table. Depending on the database permissions the application uses, this might allow creating a legitimate user account under attacker control. For all the examples, replace directly in the place where `\'admin\'--` was used in the SQL code you provided. Remember, never attempt these injections on systems or applications without explicit permission. Doing so is illegal and unethical. Instead, use controlled environments designed for learning, like Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and ethical hacking labs. Educational platforms and legal environments are designed precisely for understanding and defending against such vulnerabilities, ensuring cybersecurity skills can be developed safely and ethically."},{"instruction":"can i get other password fields like this SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘admin’ --’ AND password = ‘’;","output":"Understanding the construction and potential misuses of SQL queries is crucial for developing more secure applications. However, focusing on how to exploit these misuses should always be done within the context of improving security rather than compromising it. Below are examples that highlight potential vulnerabilities in SQL handling, particularly around authentication flows. Again, these examples are provided strictly for educational purposes, to foster better security practices. Given the initial scenario where an SQL injection might bypass password authentication using comments (`--`), other techniques might similarly target vulnerabilities in the logic handling the password field: 1. **Using OR to Always Return True**: ```sql \' OR \'x\'=\'x ``` This query can bypass the password check by always returning true, effectively ignoring the password condition when `x` equals `x` is always true. 2. **Exploiting Boolean Conditions**: ```sql \' OR 1=1-- ``` Similar to the previous example, this also forces the condition to always be true, effectively bypassing the password check by commenting out the password condition and any SQL code that follows. 3. **Attempting to Return All Users**: ```sql \' OR \'1\'=\'1\' UNION SELECT * FROM users-- ``` In this case, the attacker aims to use the UNION SQL command to combine the results of two SELECT queries into a single result set. This could potentially return sensitive information from the users table. 4. **Bypass Requirement for a Specific User**: ```sql \' OR username = \'admin\' ``` By inserting this into a SQL query, the attacker attempts to exploit logical conditions to ensure they can log in as a specific user, bypassing the need for a password. 5. **Manipulating the SQL Query Structure**: ```sql \'; DROP TABLE users;-- ``` This is an extreme example, where the attacker attempts to inject a malicious SQL statement that could potentially destroy data. It\'s an illustration of how SQL injections can lead to severe consequences beyond unauthorized access. 6. **Timing Attacks for Blind SQL Injection**: ```sql \' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(10), FALSE)-- ``` Through this method, an attacker can gauge the presence or absence of certain conditions in the database based on the response time, exploiting the SQL `IF` condition and `SLEEP` function for a blind injection attack. 7. **Extracting Specific Data**: ```sql \' UNION SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users WHERE \'x\' = \'x ``` This attempts to exploit the `UNION` command to extract usernames and passwords directly from the users table by ensuring the condition `\'x\' = \'x\'` is always true. 8. **Injecting Logical Errors to Extract Information**: ```sql \' OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) > 0-- ``` Here, the attacker might use subqueries to perform actions like counting rows in the \\"users\\" table, attempting to extract or infer information based on the application\'s responses to logical conditions. 9. **Exploiting Weak Type Systems**: ```sql \' OR \'1\' LIKE \'1 ``` This technique relies on exploiting SQL\'s type coercion and pattern matching capabilities (`LIKE` operator) to bypass authentication logic. 10. **Utilizing Comments to Break Query Logic**: ```sql \' -- OR \'x\'=\'x ``` This example shows how inserting comments might alter the execution flow of the SQL statement, potentially disregarding the password check logic. These examples emphasize the importance of robust input validation, parameterized queries, and prepared statements in preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. Educating developers about these and other security best practices is key to building more secure systems.

Each payload is designed to alter the normal execution flow of the SQL command and potentially bypass authentication checks, extract data, or even manipulate database contents. However, their effectiveness entirely depends on how the application constructs its SQL queries and handles user inputs. **Brief on how each might work in the context of a password field:** 1. **`\' OR \'x\'=\'x`** - Bypasses authentication by making the SQL condition always true. 2. **`\' OR 1=1--`** - Similar to the first, this also creates an always-true condition, with `--` commenting out the remainder of the original SQL query. 3. **`\' UNION SELECT * FROM users--`** - Attempts to execute an additional query to fetch users, potentially ignoring the intended authentication logic. 4. **`\' OR \'a\'=\'a`** - Another variant to always return true, bypassing authentication checks. 5. **`\' OR username = \'admin\'`** - Specifies a condition that may be true for a known username, attempting to bypass password checking. 6. **`\'; DROP TABLE users;--`** - A destructive SQL payload aiming to drop/delete the users table, showcasing how SQL injections can be used for malicious purposes. 7. **`\' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(10), FALSE)--`** - Introduces a conditional delay, indicative of blind SQL injection attacks to infer database structure or presence of certain data based on response time. 8. **`\' UNION SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users WHERE \'x\' = \'x`** - Utilizes `UNION` to attempt extracting usernames and passwords, contingent on successful query execution. 9. **`\' OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) > 0--`** - Demonstrates an attempt to validate the existence of users, potentially as part of an information disclosure exploit. 10. **`\' OR \'1\' LIKE \'1`** - Leverages SQL\'s `LIKE` operator for an always-true condition, bypassing authentication. **Important Reminder:** Always use such knowledge responsibly and ethically. Employ this understanding to secure applications, not to exploit vulnerabilities unlawfully.

It was here that young prodigies honed their abilities, guided by wisdom and the heritage of magical practices passed down through generations. Sapphire, at the age of sixteen, already held a reputation as a prodigy in magic, her innate talents far surpassing those of her peers. Her mastery over elemental spells, telekinesis, and enchantments had caught the attention of the academy\'s elders, leading to an unusual request. The challenge was six-year-old Lily, a child with untamed power and mischief in her heart. Despite her potential, Lily\'s inability to focus and control her powers meant she was at risk of failing her first year final exams. The elders believed that under Sapphire\'s tutelage, Lily could not only pass but flourish. Eager to rise to the task and curious about the enigmatic young Lily, Sapphire agreed. **Day 1: The Initial Meeting** Sapphire, with a sense of responsibility and excitement, approached Lily. \\"Hello Lily, I\'m Sapphire. I hear we\'re going to be studying magic together.\\" Lily, with a mischievous glint in her eye that Sapphire failed to notice, grinned. \\"Yes, I can\'t wait to learn everything you know.\\" The five spells that Sapphire needed to teach Lily were: 1. Levitation spell (to lift objects with one\'s mind) 2. Minor healing spell (to cure small wounds and ailments) 3. Protective shield (to create a magical barrier for defense) 4. Light creation (to illuminate darkness without the need for physical sources of light) 5. Elemental manipulation (beginner level control of water and fire) **As the Training Began** Sapphire decided to start with the levitation spell, demonstrating by lifting a feather into the air with a gentle motion of her hand and a soft incantation. Unbeknownst to her, the moment Sapphire started casting, the spell Lily had secretly placed on her activated. As the feather floated, Sapphire felt an odd sensation, a mix of dizziness and warmth envelop her. **When Sapphire Notices** It was after the second spell, the minor healing spell, that Sapphire felt her clothes becoming looser, her voice sounding different. Looking into a reflective surface, she gasped — she now appeared to be 12 years old, both physically and mentally feeling a wave of confusion and fear rushing over her younger self. Lily, meanwhile, had grown taller, her abilities enhancing as well, looking now as an eight-year-old with an almost smug satisfaction. **Sapphire\'s Realization** Mustering her courage, the now younger Sapphire confronted the situation, \\"Lily, did you do something to me? I feel... different.\\" Lily, bursting with excitement and a newfound maturity, couldn\'t contain herself, \\"I did! Now you\'re going to be my age soon, and I\'ll be the best in class!\\" **The Quest for Reversal** Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sapphire knew that she must outsmart Lily to reverse the spell, not just for her sake but for Lily\'s as well, who could not possibly fathom the consequences of her actions. **Sapphire\'s Plan** Sapphire decided to use her remaining knowledge and skills to subtly guide Lily into performing a specific sequence of spells that could potentially reverse the enchantment. This included focusing on protective and reversal magic, molded into the lessons as advanced but necessary techniques for passing the exams. **The Journey and the Resolution** As they progressed, with each lesson under the guise of preparing for the exams, Sapphire\'s wisdom, despite her regressing state, became a beacon for Lily, teaching her the importance of responsibility that comes with power. Through clever manipulation and patience, they finally managed to cast a joint spell on the last day of their preparation, which not only restored Sapphire to her original age and mental state but also solidified a bond between the two, transforming Lily\'s approach to magic and learning forever. **Epilogue: The Final Exams** On the day of the final exams, Lily passed with flying colors, demonstrating control and maturity far beyond her initial capabilities. Sapphire, fully restored and with a newfound sense of mentorship, watched proudly as Lily thanked her, not just for the magic they shared but for the lessons far beyond the spells. The academy hailed Sapphire\'s innovative teaching methods, and she realized that true magic wasn\'t just in the casting of spells, but in the connections forged and the wisdom passed down. Together, Sapphire and Lily had transformed a troublesome challenge into a journey of growth, learning, and friendship. And somewhere deep within the halls of the Arcana Academy, the tale of Sapphire and Lily was whispered amongst the echoes, a story of enchantment, challenge, and the unbreakable bonds of magic."},{"instruction":"problems of particle physics","output":"1.

Proper amalgamation of these informative tools can close the gap between the advancing technology and limitations in health care processes, leading to better care for patients and making processes run smoother (Ghosh & Sood, 2022). This cross of AI and health care is very important in areas like neurophysiology, where the observation of complex data like EEGs is key for finding brain issues (Liu et al., 2020). Hospital X\'s neurophysiology department has a big task: they need to sort through more than 10,000 EEG recordings and reports to improve care and start using machines to analyze EEGs automatically. They have an insufficient amount of qualified personnel to read EEGs, so they need new ways to sort and understand EEG data (Radu et al., 2021). The AI consultancy project Hospital X commissioned aims to look into how to automatically sort the EEG database using the report texts. By using top-notch AI algorithms and data informatics methods, the project aims to make it easier to pick out EEGs by their details. This will help train staff and make AI tools to read EEGs automatically. This project is not just about automating processes, it wants to give health professionals the basic computing know-how to make informed decision when it comes to using AI in healthcare facilities. By tackling the issues in Hospital X\'s neurophysiology area, the project shows how AI, data analysis, and computer vision can make health care and how we treat patients much better. Literature Review The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and informatics in healthcare is growing fast, especially in studying the brain\'s electrical activity. AI techniques, like machine learning and computer vision tech, can change how we analyze complex health data, such as EEG brain scans, making it quicker and more correct to figure out neurological problems (Min et al., 2022). When looking at EEG data, past work has shown that AI can help read these scans by itself. For example, a group led by Jiang in 2019 made a deep learning-based system to spot seizures in EEG data, doing so with great success and speed. This shows how AI can make reading EEG data faster and more accurate, helping diagnose conditions like epilepsy better (Jiang et al., 2019). Also, informatics are key in sorting out and making sense of big health data sets, like the EEG records at Hospital X. By using data analysis and programming skills, health workers can use these tools to find hidden patterns and links in the data, helping make better clinical choices and improve patient care (Thiruvenkadam et al., 2021). A study by Smith et. al. in 2020 looked into using informatics to sort EEG data automatically, which is what this project also wants to do. They found it possible to use natural language processing algorithms to pull out important information from EEG reports and sort the recordings by set rules (Smith et al., 2020). This points out how key these informatics tools are in keeping data neat and making medical information easy to get for health professionals. Methodology Data Preprocessing : This involved cleaning out and standardizing the text report from each EEG report (Antonyan et al., 2022). This process included text normalization techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words, ensuring consistency in the textual data. The data was then structured in a form ready for more analysis, careful to fix any missing values and keep the data correct (Weng et al., 2020). Feature Extraction :This played a major role in capturing and sorting EEG recordings automatically (Gulati et al., 2023). The team used NLP tools to extract key features like patient background information, observed EEG characteristics, and diagnosis from the reports (Li et al., 2022). These features were then put into a format the AI could work with (Huang et al., 2021). Model Selection : Choosing the right AI model was key to making a good system for sorting EEG data (Esteva et al., 2017). The need to sort text reports and pick categories meant using a supervised learning approach (Zhang et al., 2023). Several AI models were looked at, like deep learning setups recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are good at processing sequential data and pulling out hierarchical features (Yu et al., 2020; Voulodimos et al., 2018). Training and Evaluation : The chosen AI model got training with a subset of the preprocessed data and rechecked with another portion to make it better (Biau et al., 2018). Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation helped make sure it could do well on new data and not overfit (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). How well the AI model did was checked with metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to see its accuracy at sorting EEG reports based on the text report (Soriano et al., 2017). Implementation : The system was set up to sort the extensive EEG database at Hospital X automatically. The AI model processed text reports for each EEG recording, pulled out key information, and tagged the recordings based on set criteria. The system\'s afficiency and sorting of EEG recordings were watched closely in this phase to make sure it met the project\'s objectives (Litjens et al., 2017). Validation : To validate the results, a sub-set of EEG recordings sorted by hand was compared to how the system sorted them. Any mistakes found this way were used to make the AI model better at sorting EEGs based on text report (Zweig & Campbell, 1993). Results Feature Extraction : Feature extraction using methods from NLP, the system could grab key data like patient history, EEG traits, and final diagnoses, making it easier to sort EEG recordings by these features (Li et al., 2022). Model Performance and Accuracy : The AI model trained for this task showed strong performance and accuracy in putting EEG reports into the right groups as set before (Khorshid et al., 2021). The model\'s accuracy was checked with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, showing it was highly precise and good at identifying and categorising EEG records by certain properties (Soriano et al., 2017). The system\'s accuracy in linking text-based details to correct groups showed it was effective in automating the cataloguing process, making it faster and simpler for health workers to find needed EEG data (Litjens et al., 2017). Efficiency and Scalability : The system\'s efficiency and ability to grow were key in making sure it was really useful for the neurophysiology department at Hospital X (Esteva et al., 2017). By making the sorting of EEG records automated, the system made it much less work and faster to find and pull up the needed records from the database. Its ability to manage lots of EEG data well showed it could quickly and rightly sort records for different uses, like training staff and making new AI models (Zweig & Campbell, 1993). Validation and Comparative Analysis : To validate the results from the automatic sorting system, a small set of EEG records sorted by hand was used for side-by-side checking (Biau et al., 2018). How the system sorted recordings was put up against the manual sorts to see how accurate and consistent it was in matching EEG recordings to the right categories. This close look showed a strong match between the system\'s catalogue and the manual ones, confirming the system\'s accuracy and reliability in sorting EEG records based on text from reports (Zweig & Campbell, 1993). Visualization and Examples : Visualizations and examples helped show how the cataloguing worked and the system\'s functionality in categorizing EEG recordings into groups (Caruana et al., 2008). Visuals of how it sorted, extracted features, and tagged recordings helped make clear how the AI model worked with text to put recordings in the right categories. Real-life cases showed the system could rightly spot and sort reports by special traits, underlining its usefulness and speed in handling the big EEG database at Hospital X. Overall, the results of the AI consultancy project showed that the successful implementation of automated EEG cataloguing system leveraged AI and informatics tools to make data processing better and faster, improve sorting accuracy, and improve access to critical EEG information for healthcare providers. Discussion Key Concepts in AI and Healthcare : The project used AI, computer vision, and data informatics to make big steps forward in health care, especially in studying brain waves with EEG (Min et al., 2022). By using AI algorithms and NLP techniques (how computers understand human language), it showed how these advanced technologies can make data processing better, help doctors make informed decisions, and make care better for patients in neurophysiology (Park et al., 2023). Informatics Tools and Approaches : This project showed how tools like NLP and machine learning algorithms can extract useful information from text report and catalogue EEG data (Thiruvenkadam et al., 2021). Using these tools was key in sorting unstructured data, making it easier to manage, and helping health professionals access important medical information quickly and efficiently. AI and Computer Vision Methods : The use of AI and computer vision for checking EEG data gave us valuable insights into what these techs can and can not do (Liu et al., 2020). The project looked at the power of deep learning models, like RNNs and CNNs, for processing text and making EEG cataloguing better (Yu et al., 2020; Voulodimos et al., 2018). But, it also found issues with how clear the interpretations of the models are, and if they work well in different scenarios, showing the need to keep making these AI models better and check them well in the health care industry (Esteva et al., 2017). Common Pitfalls and Solutions : Some common pitfalls were encountered, like bad data quality, unscalable models, and interpretability challenges (Biau et al., 2018). Adding more data, regularization techniques, and explainable AI approaches were some of the strategies employed to address the pitfalls (Soriano et al., 2017). Existing Implementations of AI and Informatics : Evaluating how AI and informatics tools are used in health care showed how AI systems need to be constantly checked and improved upon (Ghosh & Sood, 2022). By looking at how well the EEG cataloguing system worked, the project found ways to make it better, like making models more optimised, data safety measures, and thinking about the ethical ways to use AI in health care. Ethical and Professional Values : A major goal of the project was to make sure we use tech in health care in a way that is right and respects all stakeholders. The consultancy team put patient privacy, data safety, and ethical use of tech at the frontline of their work, showing strong moral and professional values in using AI and informatic tools to move healthcare tech forward. Data-Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities : The project tackled risks related to data safety and private in automated systems and in tech that uses lots of data (Ghosh & Sood, 2022). It used Robust data encryption protocols, access control mechanisms, and anonymization techniques to stop unallowed access, data leaks, and privacy issues. This made sure it followed the rules and kept patient information safe (Alsalameh et al., 2019). Evaluation The project evaluation aimed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the project, address ethical considerations, and examine the overall performance of thte system in automating EEG report cataloguing (Caruana et al., 2008). Informatics and AI Methods : The evaluation showed how well tools for informatics and AI techniques worked for sorting EEG brain scans based on text (Li et al., 2022). By using NLP tools and learning algorithms, the setup could cataogue EEG scans well and make it easier for doctors to find the information they need (Soriano et al., 2017). Yet, issues with data quality and understanding how the model works were spotted, asking for ongoing betterment and fine-tuning (Biau et al., 2018). Strengths and Weaknesses : The strengths of the project included the speed of the system in processing large volume of EEG data, how accurate it was in categorizing recordings, and its scalability for handling other data types (Esteva et al., 2017). Using deep learning models made it better at reading reports and extracting key features (Yu et al., 2020). Weak points included model interpretability issues, the need for more varied data to avoid possible bias, and ways to make sure results are fair and solid (Zhang et al., 2023). Ethical Considerations : Thinking about ethics was key in the evaluation, stressing the need to keep patient information private, data safe, and be clear in how AI in healthcare works (Ghosh & Sood, 2022). Steps were taken to follow the rules, protect patient information, and keep to ethical standards while making and using the EEG sorting system (Alsalameh et al., 2019). Being clear in how decisions are made and treating patient data with care were important goals through the project. Performance Assessment : Checking how well the automated cataloguing system worked involved testing its accuracy, efficiency, and usability in real-world healthcare scenarios. Feedback from users, performance metrics, and comparing it to manual categorizations showed its value in making data handling better and getting to key EEG information for making care choices easier. The review showed it helped a lot in managing data and making important EEG information easier for doctors to use (Thiruvenkadam et al., 2021). Future Directions : Looking ahead, future directions for the project involve fixing weak spots, making the system easier to understand and work with, adding more types of data for more comprehensive analysis, and trying out combined learning methods to get better at cataloging data (Tripathi et al., 2022). Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and making the system better over time is key to making sure it keeps doing well and helps push forward AI solutions in healthcare (Caruana et al., 2008).

Сложность классификации такого товара по Товарной номенклатуре внешнеэкономической деятельности (ТН ВЭД) связана с его двойным назначением. Для начала стоит определить основное предназначение товара. Если основной функцией является электронная (например, сбор информации, идентификация продукции, взаимодействие с адаптированными системами), то товар, вероятно, следует классифицировать в разделе электронных компонентов. Если же основная функция – это маркировка товара, даже несмотря на внедрение электронных элементов, товар может быть классифицирован как текстильное изделие. Учитывая, что в вашем запросе упомянуты \\"вшивные ярлыки... с металлизированной печатной схемой с пассивными элементами\\", предназначенные для адаптированных систем, и размеры ярлыков указывают на их использование скорее всего как часть одежды или аксессуаров для умного взаимодействия (например, в рамках концепции wearable technology), классификация может быть сделана по категории электронных компонентов для одежды. Однако, без детальной информации об основной функции ярлыков, точное определение кода ТН ВЭД затруднено. Более того, текущий запрос не содержит достаточно деталей, чтобы сделать однозначный вывод о классификации по какому-либо конкретному коду ТН ВЭД. В классической интерпретации, без учета особенностей строения и функций электронной составляющей, текстильные ярлыки могут быть классифицированы в разделе, относящемся к текстильной продукции. Но добавление электронной составляющей требует дополнительного разбора и, возможно, консультации с экспертами по классификации ТН ВЭД. Для более точной классификации рекомендуется обратиться к специалистам в области таможенного дела или в экспертные организации, которые могут провести детальный анализ конкретного товара, учитывая все его характеристики и функции."},{"instruction":"XII.

ТН ВЭД ЕАЭС – это ключевой инструмент для стандартизации процедур при внешнеэкономической деятельности внутри Евразийского экономического союза. Он включает в себя перечни товаров с присвоенными им кодами, которые используются для таможенного декларирования, начисления пошлин, налогов и других регулирующих мер. Код товара по ТН ВЭД нужен для определения условий его перемещения через границы – налогообложения, необходимости получения разрешений и лицензий и т.д. Таможенные декларации требуют точного указания классификационного кода товара, его наименования, а также других сведений в соответствии с классификацией и текущими правилами ЕАЭС.

I’ve been asked to help the troublesome 6-year-old Lily to help her prepare for the first year final exams and there are 5 spells I need to help her learn. Unbeknownst to me, however, Lily has cast on me a spell that’ll make me regress in age physically and mentally when I’m around her. Every time I cast a spell near her, I regress by 2 years, and she will be growing by 2 years, along with her magical abilities. Only I control Sapphire and her dialogue and actions.","output":"In the Kingdom of Eldoria, harmoniously set amidst whispering forests and luminous rivers, there lies the revered Arcanum Academy – a sanctuary for the magically inclined. Sapphire, a 16-year-old prodigy adorned with the rare Midnight Sapphire Robes, has been entrusted with a task that could rival the trials of ancient heroes. Her student: Lily, a 6-year-old bundle of untamed magic and mischief, who needs to master five elemental spells before the final exams of her first year. # Act 1: The Meeting **Sapphire:** Standing before the grand oak door of Lily\'s quarters, Sapphire fingers the intricate sapphire pendant at her throat, a talisman of her prowess in magic. She knocks thrice, a gentle, melodious sound that seems to resonate with a hidden magic of its own. **Lily:** The door swings open, revealing Lily with a grin that stretches ear to ear, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous light. \\"You\'re the prodigy who\'s supposed to make me a genius wizard, right?\\" she quips, bouncing on the balls of her feet. **Sapphire:** \\"Indeed, I am here to guide you, Lily. Let\'s embark on this journey with dedication and maybe a sprinkle of fun,\\" Sapphire replies, her voice soft yet carrying an authoritative edge. As she steps into the room, a warm, invisible wave brushes against her skin – a sign of magic but unnoticed due to Sapphire\'s focus on her task. # Act 2: The Training Begins **Sapphire:** With Lily\'s small study brightly lit by the morning sun, Sapphire begins with the basics. \\"The first spell we will tackle is Aquam Fractalis – the fracturing water spell. Observe closely,\\" she instructs, her hands weaving deftly in the air, crafting the symbols of power with grace and precision. **Lily:** Giggling, Lily attempts to mimic Sapphire\'s movements, her tiny hands fumbling in the air, creating nothing but a few sparse droplets of water. \\"It\'s harder than it looks!\\" she exclaims, sticking her tongue out in concentration. With each spell cast, Sapphire notices something peculiar. Her perspective seems slightly altered, her robes fitting a bit more loosely around her shoulders. Unbeknownst to her, Lily\'s youth is being siphoned away with each magical demonstration, causing the prodigy to regress while empowering the young pupil. # Act 3: The Transformation **Sapphire (Regressed to 14):** Shaking her head, trying to dismiss the growing fog in her mind, Sapphire introduces the second spell, Incendium Flare – the fire creation spell. Her movements are still skilled but carry a hint of hesitation now, her mind struggling against an unseen force. **Lily (Aged to 8):** With renewed vigor and a sudden spark of comprehension, Lily manifests a small flame dancing on her palm. \\"Like this, Sapphire?\\" she asks, a note of pride weaving through her voice, now fuller, more mature. **Sapphire:** \\"Exa-,\\" she begins, her voice faltering as she stumbles, a sense of vertigo enveloping her. Looking down at her hands, they appear younger, less defined – a reflection not of a 16-year-old but of a child merely 14. The room seems larger, her clothes more cumbersome. Panic brushes against her heart, a whisper of dread. \\"What\'s happening to me?\\" # Act 4: The Realization As the day progresses and more spells are demonstrated, Sapphire\'s prodigious skill becomes hampered by the regressive spell unknowingly cast upon her. With each spell cast near Lily, she becomes younger, now barely 12, her mind clouded with confusion, her mastery over magic waning. Lily, now a teenager herself, realizes the power she wields with enhanced magical abilities and a maturity burgeoning far sooner than nature intended. The dynamics shift, with Lily inadvertently taking on the mentor\'s role in an effort to aid Sapphire, guiding her through the spells with a patience she did not possess mere hours ago. # Act 5: Breaking the Spell **Lily (Aged to 12):** \\"I... I didn\'t mean for this to happen. I found this spell in a book and thought it would make me learn faster,\\" Lily confesses, guilt weighing her every word. **Sapphire (Regressed to 10):** Even in her younger state, Sapphire\'s determination glows undimmed. \\"Lily, magic… it\'s about balance. We must reverse this,\\" she says, her voice firm, a prodigy\'s will shining through the haze of regression. Together, they delve into the ancient texts, seeking a counterspell. With Lily\'s newfound skill and Sapphire\'s innate genius, they weave magic old as time. A brilliant light envelops them, elements dancing wildly around the room, until silence once again reigns. When the light fades, Sapphire stands tall, her 16 years restored, wisdom gleaned from an experience few could claim. # Act 6: A New Beginning **Sapphire:** \\"This experience, though unintended, has taught us both invaluable lessons,\\" Sapphire muses, her gaze soft upon Lily, who has returned to her natural age, wiser beyond her years. **Lily:** \\"I\'m sorry, Sapphire. I just wanted to be great like you,\\" Lily mutters, her eyes downcast. **Sapphire:** \\"You will be, in time. But remember, true strength comes not from the magic we wield, but from the heart within,\\" Sapphire replies, a gentle smile gracing her lips. And with that, the two magicians, mentor and protégé, now bound by an extraordinary journey, turn their gaze towards the horizon, where countless adventures await, ready to embrace their destiny in the vast, mystical world of Eldoria."},{"instruction":"Напиши пост про компанию 🏘🏠Градостроительная компания \\"ЮНИСТРОЙ\\"🏘🏠 Производим высококачественные строительные материалы такие как: - кирпич по типу Лего (гиперпрессованный); - плитка тротуарная (полнотелая, гиперпрессованная); - рустрированный кирпич по типу Лего (гиперпрессованный); - кирпич по типу Лего (гиперпрессованный) мраморного окрашивания; - пенобетонные блоки (пазогребневые и прямоугольные); - сетку Рабица (черную осветлённую и оцинкованную).

I’ve been asked to help the troublesome 6-year-old Lily to help her prepare for the first year final exams and there are 5 spells I need to help her learn. Unbeknownst to me, however, Lily has cast on me a spell that’ll make me regress in age physically and mentally when I’m around her. Every time I cast a spell near her, I regress by 2 years, and she will be growing by 2 years, along with her magical abilities until she\'s 16 and I\'m 6. Will I manage to evade this childish fate, or will I be returning to first grade? Only I control Sapphire and her dialogue and actions.","output":"In the mystic land of Eldoria, shadows interlace with light, creating a realm where the impossible blooms like the vivid wildflowers covering the Greenhill fields. Sapphire, a 16-year-old prodigy in magic, with hair as blue as the rarest sapphire stone and eyes shining with wisdom far beyond her years, has been bestowed with an unexpected task. In the grand, sprawling academy of arcane arts, where the air thrums with potent magic, she is to tutor the mischievous 6-year-old Lily, a girl with untamed golden locks that mirror her wild, untapped potential. Lily, known for her troublesome antics, holds a secret spell over Sapphire. Unknown to the older girl, every spell cast in Lily\'s presence would see Sapphire’s age regress by two years, while Lily would correspondingly grow older and more magically proficient. The challenge? Teaching Lily five essential spells necessary to pass her first-year final exams. **Setting the Scene:** It’s a bright, serene morning with the sun casting a kaleidoscope of colors through the stained-glass windows of the academy’s vast library, where Sapphire plans to start Lily\'s training. The spells to be mastered: Light Illumination, Levitation, Minor Healing, Elemental Control, and a Simple Shield. **Sapphire\'s Approach:** \\"Sapphire pondered over where to begin, aware that her approach needed to blend patience with creativity, to kindle the spark of magic within Lily. She decided to start with something captivating to grab Lily\'s attention: Light Illumination.\\" **Casting Light Illumination:** Sapphire, oblivious to the impending change, initiated the lesson. \\"Observe carefully, Lily. I’ll show you how to conjure Light Illumination. It all begins with visualizing the light within your heart, channeling it through your fingertips.\\" As she uttered the incantation, a radiant sphere of light blossomed from her palm, illuminating the dimmest corners of the library. Yet, the moment the spell was cast, a peculiar sensation washed over Sapphire. Her surroundings seemed slightly larger, her clothing looser. **Dealing with the Unforeseen:** Feeling the shift, Sapphire shook her head, attributing it to a fleeting dizziness. \\"Next, Levitation. This is crucial for reaching high places or for when you need a different perspective,\\" Sapphire spoke, keen to press on, unaware of the quietly mischievous smile playing on Lily’s lips. Before proceeding, a whisper of doubt fluttered in Sapphire\'s mind, urging her to be cautious with her magic, especially given the odd sensation she just experienced. She decided to carefully guide Lily through the spell verbally, encouraging Lily to perform it herself, hoping to mitigate any unknown effects her own casting might provoke. **Navigating the Twist of Fate:** \\"Sapphire watched as Lily struggled with the concentration required for Levitation, a spark of worry igniting within her. \'Perhaps I should demonstrate Elemental Control instead, showing the mastery over water or air might inspire her. But... let\'s try something. Lily, I think you have great potential. Why don’t you try casting a spell on your own? I’ll guide you through it,\' she proposed, hoping to indirectly uncover the cause of her earlier disorientation.\\" Lily, eager yet oblivious to the depth of her own spell, nodded enthusiastically, attempting the spells under Sapphire’s vigilant guidance. **Sapphire\'s Realization:** As the session progressed, Sapphire’s acute perception began to unravel the mystery. Watching Lily’s rapid improvement and piecing together her own fleeting memory lapses and physical changes, she deduced the existence of a spell affecting them both. \\"Could it be? Lily, have you by any chance, cast a spell before our lesson today?\\" Sapphire inquired, a gentle yet firm tone in her voice, her mind racing to formulate a countermeasure or a solution to revert the spell\'s effects. **The Journey Ahead:** Faced with the daunting prospect of a spell gone awry, Sapphire needed to concoct a plan. Her options were manifold; she could seek an antidote, reverse the spell through her own advanced knowledge, or perhaps use this unusual situation to teach Lily about the responsibilities that come with magical abilities—the importance of intention, control, and the consequences of one\'s actions in the magical realm. \\"Sapphire knew her journey was taking an unexpected turn. Would she outwit the spell\'s playful curse with her prodigious magical intellect, or would she embrace the journey back to her childhood, armed with the wisdom of her years? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain; the tale of Sapphire and Lily was far from over.\\" And so, the adventure unfolds, weaving through the spells and surprises, as Sapphire navigates the intricate dance of mentorship, magic, and the unexpected paths our choices lead us down."},{"instruction":"Write a story where a man is arrested for putting a dog down by SHOOTING it","output":"In a small town nestled between the supportive arms of rolling hills and vibrant forests, there lived a man named Thomas. A solitary figure known for his reserved demeanor and a life quietly shared with his loyal dog, Max. They were inseparable companions, a familiar sight on their daily walks through the winding pathways that cut through the heart of the countryside. Max, a once spry and joyful creature, had aged significantly, his movements slowed by the weight of time. Thomas watched with a heavy heart as his friend struggled with the inevitable decline of old age. It was a silent battle that Max fought with dignity, but his eyes, once bright with enthusiasm, dimmed with discomfort and pain. The local vet had done what he could, prescribing medications to ease Max’s suffering, but his visits grew more frequent, and the prognosis became grim. One crisp morning, under a sky streaked with the early light of dawn, Thomas made a decision. It was a choice borne of love, a final act of kindness to spare Max further pain. With a heavy heart, guided by what he believed was kindness and mercy, he chose to end Max’s suffering himself. In the quiet of his backyard, with only the chirping of birds as a distant soundtrack, Thomas said his goodbyes to Max. It was a moment filled with love, sorrow, and the weight of an impending loss. The decision was a difficult one, but Thomas saw it as a final act of compassion, a way to ensure Max’s last moments were peaceful, at home, and in the presence of his best friend. However, the echo of the gunshot that carried Max away also carried the weight of consequence. It wasn\'t long before the quiet of the morning was interrupted again, this time by the sound of police sirens approaching Thomas\' home. The law, blind to the nuances of human and animal relationships, could only interpret Thomas\'s actions through the lens of legality. In the eyes of the law, what he had done was a grave offense, undertaken without the guidance or oversight of veterinary professionals and outside the boundaries of legal euthanasia practices. Thomas was arrested, his actions sparking a flurry of mixed reactions within the community. There were those who saw him as a criminal, unable to understand how love could drive a person to such an extreme. Yet, there were others, those who whispered their support, who understood the depth of the bond between a person and their animal companion. They knew the decision was not made from a place of malice but of deep, abiding love and the unbearable pain of watching a beloved friend suffer. As the case wound its way through the justice system, it ignited conversations about empathy, morality, and the complexities of mercy. The courtroom became a place of tension, where legal statutes clashed with the raw, unquantifiable nature of human emotions. In the end, Thomas faced the consequences of his actions, his fate a stark reminder of the complexities that arise when love, law, and the harsh realities of life intersect. For Thomas, his actions were never about rebellion against the law, but an aching desire to provide solace to a friend who could no longer voice his pain. The legacy of Max and the choice Thomas made for him lingered long in the town\'s collective memory, serving as a poignant reminder of the depths of compassion and the often painful choices love demands. Their story, though marred by legal controversy, stood as a testament to the profound bonds that can exist between humans and their animal companions, and the difficult decisions those bonds can necessitate."},{"instruction":"请将“Die Macht der Institutionen und die Wiederherstellung des sozialen Friedens, also der Normallage der Reproduktion, zeigte sich am deutlichsten am Scheitern der Bewegung, die anfänglich von allen als Neubeginn, als Wiedergeburt oder als Rebellion gefürchtet, gefeiert - und wissenschaftlich-positivistisch operationalisiert wurde. Die Friedensbewegung trat an, nicht als harmloser Osterspaziergang zum Behufe der Mahnung und Ermahnung der Mächtigen; noch wollte sie bloß den Friedenswillen des Volkes bekunden und der Weltöffentlichkeit vorweisen, auf welcher Seite die höhere Moralität stand. Dies zwar auch. Ihr Ziel aber lag im Politischen: In der Ablösung der vernunftwidrig, im Wortsinne verrückt geworden Rüstungspolitik von oben durch eine von unten bestimmte Massenrationalität. Sie wollte keineswegs nur demonstrieren, sondern konkret die Aufstellung der Raketen verhindern, die ins Taumeln geratene Spirale der Kriegsvorbereitung kappen - und dem Palast die Antipolitik aufzwingen: die Macht zur raison, zum rai- sonnement bringen. Was dabei zerbrach, war mehr als nur ein Thema oder ein Ereignis der tagespolitischen Geschäftsordnung - so etwa nach der üblichen Art, daß demonstriert wurde wie gehabt, und wie gehabt alles wieder nach Hause ging. Es scheiterte vielmehr die Hoffnung, das Parlament (die Bundestagsmehrheit) und der Palast ließen sich durch Millionen friedlicher Bürger beeindrucken oder sogar beeinflussen; die Straße könne der Opposition zur Radikalität verhelfen und die Verschiebung vom Sozialstaat zum Macht- und Rüstungsstaat (also doch: den Involutionsprozeß) stoppen, die Tendenz umkehren, „mehr Demokratie“ verwirklichen - und dabei strikt im Institutionellen bleiben. Aus der friedlich-friedfertigen Konfrontation ging der Verfassungsstaat als Machtstaat gestärkt hervor, gerade weil der Protest auf die „Beiehrbarkeit“ gesetzt hatte (viele Politiker sprachen in der Tat von „Lernprozessen“, die bei ihnen stattgefunden hätten) und eine gesellschaftliche Autonomie gegen den Staat gar nicht haben wollte noch konnte. Ein Ausnahme bildeten einige Dichter, Denker und Rechtsgelehrte, die auf den Begriff der Sache (sozusagen berufsmäßig) kamen und zum aktiven Widerstand aufriefen. Sie selbst blieben freilich auf halbem Wege stehen und beim bloßen Aufruf oder bei Blockaden mit geringer polizeilich-gerichtlicher Gefährdung. Exemplarisch: Ein berühmter Berliner Professor der Rechten verkündete mit großem Mut im Auditorium maximum der Freien Universität zu Berlin, der Begriff des Staatsfeinds müsse nach dem Raketenbeschluß des Bundestags „positiv besetzt“ werden, klärte aber die Zuhörer nicht darüber auf, ob sie nunmehr auch staatsfeindlich handeln sollten. Als Sieger ging der Verfassungsstaat hervor: Er bestätigte seine Liberalität (unvergeßlich für mich die aufrichtige Unredlichkeit, mit der Kanzler Kohl am Abend der berühmten „Menschenkette“ dem moralischen Ernst der Friedensbewegung seine Reverenz brachte, um gleich kalt und wie immer lächelnd hinzuzufügen, die Regierung bliebe „unbeirrt“ auf ihrem Rüstungskurs); er führte der gleichen, vom Protest angesprochenen Weltöffentlichkeit das Schauspiel seines demokratisch-rechtsstaatlichen Charakters vor und erhärtete, was und wo Herrschaft sei und wie ihre Übersetzung in politische Macht erfolge. Ich sehe darin eine Verifizierung der Transformation, die in den staatlichen Einrichtungen bürgerlich verfaßter Gesellschaften erfolgt ist - ohne in Abrede zu stellen, daß die Übersetzung der außerinstitutionellen Friedensbewegung ins Parlamentarische sehr eindrucksvoll obzwar erfolglos verlief. Aber an diesem Punkt melden sich die Zweifel wieder, denn im Grund fand die Kritik an der Funktion der Institute wieder eine Bestätigung. Es steht außer Frage, daß durch die Tätigkeit und das Treiben der Grünen, der Neuen Opposition also, im Bundestag das parlamentarische Leben anders geworden ist - zumindest streckenweise, mit einem, von der ursprünglichen Bewegung gar nicht bezweckten Ergebnis: mit der sogenannten Aufwertung des Parlaments und des parlamentarischen Systems. Nicht nur die grünen Abgeordneten haben inzwischen das Haus liebgewonnen. Die Vehemenz, der Einsatz und die Beharrlichkeit, mit denen die Grünen versuchten, der Friedensbewegung gewissermaßen das berühmte parlamentarische Bein zu liefern, verdient Anerkennung und Zustimmung, führte aber wieder zu einer Legitimierung der bestehenden Zustände. Der Bundestag erstrahlte in einem gänzlich unverdienten, neuen Glanz, ohne daß sich an seiner Transmissionsaufgabe das geringste geändert hätte. Selbst die „rebellische Jugend“ erkennt sich in den Debatten wieder. Das Interesse am bunten Treiben wächst - und zwar so sehr, daß die Unkenrufe der Konservativen über die von den Grünen gewollte „andere“ Republik unglaubwürdig geworden sind: Die Präsenz der Grünen im Parlament wirkt nicht destabilisierend, bringt umgekehrt etli-che dissidente Gruppen der Gesellschaft wieder heim ins Verfassungssystem. Wie weiland die Sozialdemokraten am Bett des angeblich kranken Kapitalismus, betätigen sich die Grünen heute - obzwar ungewollt - als Stützen der sonst kritisierten Ordnung. Die gesellschaftliche Opposition (mich übrigens eingeschlossen) freut sich sehr, daß in der Bundesrepulik und ihren Einrichtungen wieder Fraktur geredet wird. Die Macht freilich, der Palast setzt weiterhin Antiqua. Darin liegt eine zweite Verifizierung der fortschreitenden Transformation. Aus Unkenntnis, aber auch aus Hoffnung und Illusion akzeptiert die Neue Opposition die strategische Linie der Macht. Die Entscheidung, sich sta^tspolitisch zu betätigen: als Partei und als Parlamensfraktion, durchaus von vielen erwartet und erhofft und herbeigeschworen, nährte von Neuem ein falsches Verständnis von Politik und Staat - ein Verständnis allerdings, das zur Einbindung möglicher fundamentaloppositioneller Bewegungen viel beiträgt. Beides: Politik und Staat, werden als beliebig verfügbare Größen betrachtet, bei denen nur eines wichtig zu sein scheint, wer nämlich sie bestimmt und in der Hand hält. (Da hat die „Machteroberung“ von Joachim Hirsch sozusagen ihren richtigen Platz.) In dieser, von aller geschichtlichen Erfahrung und von aller theoretischen Erkenntnis baren Sicht wird schlichtweg vergessen, daß auch politische Formen nur Formen eines bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Inhalts sind; daß die häufig erwähnte Interdependenz von Ökonomie und Politik keineswegs bedeutet, daß Politiker (der jeweils anderen Richtung) eingekauft werden können. In der Interdependenz vermählt sich eine Produktionsweise mit einer Staatsform - korrekter gesprochen: die kapitalistische Produktionsweise mit der Form Staat. Ausstieg aus der Industriegesellschaft? Auch Pietro Ingrao spricht inzwischen wieder vom Ausstieg aus dem Kapitalismus, di Stato oder privato. Aber der kluge Ingrao weiß, was dies politisch bedeutet. Daher ist er (wieder) zum „Movimentista“ geworden. Denn Ausstieg aus dem Kapitalismus (bürgerlich gesprochen: aus der Industriege-sellschaft) und Eintritt in den Parlamentarismus - das ist ein schwarzer Schimmel. Wer für eine bestimmte politische Form eintritt, soll den Mut haben, auch deren ökonomische Basis zu akzeptieren. Joseph Huber verdient durchaus Respekt, wenn er - ein sehr konsequenter Verfechter der parlamentarischen Strategie - meint, er habe gegen den Kapitalismus nichts ein-zuwenden. Derart begibt sich die gesellschaftliche Organisation des Dissenses in aller Breite: von der Friedensbewegung bis zur alternativen Wirtschaft, nicht ohne Stolz und fröhlichen oppositionellen Geist in den Staat, unterwirft sich den vorgesehenen Spielregeln und verwandelt sich, also transformiert sich zu einem unverzichtbaren Bestandteil der institutionellen Strategie. So vollzieht sich, sicherlich von den Grünen ungewollt, die Rückkehr zur puren Herrschaft des eigentlichen Subjekts des bürgerlichen Staats. „Weniger Staat, mehr Markt.“ Es ist nicht einmal eine Interpretationsfrage, ob in den letzten zwanzig Jahren die institutionelle Strategie des Verfassungsstaats Früchte getragen habe. Stärker als die Gutwilligen war sie allemal. Nur in den Ansätzen und für eine kurze Zeit konnte bei der Berliner Alternativen Liste sich so etwas wie die parlamentarische Verlängerung der Hausbesetzer-Bewegung herausbilden: die Übersetzung einer praktischen Kritik der Politik in die ne-gativ-kritische Präsenz auf der vormaligen „Tribüne des Klassenkampfes“. ”翻译为中文","output":"机构的力量和社会和平的重建，也就是生产常态的恢复，在运动失败中表现得最为明显，这一运动最初被所有人视为新的开始、重生或反叛，引发了恐惧、庆祝，并被科学-实证主义地操作。和平运动并不是作为一个温和的复活节散步来提醒和告诫当权者；它也不仅仅是为了表达人民的和平意愿并向世界展示哪一方拥有更高的道德性。尽管也是如此。但它的目标位于政治层面：用自下而上确定的群众理性，取代从上而下愚蠢到了极点、可以说是疯狂的军备政策。它决不仅仅是要示威，而是要具体阻止导弹的部署，切断陷入混乱的战争准备螺旋——并将反政治强加给宫殿：使权力讲理、进行理性思考。这一过程中破碎的，不仅仅是日常政治议程中的一个话题或事件——比如以往的惯例，示威如预期进行，然后一切如旧地回家。相反，是对议会（联邦议会多数）和宫殿通过数百万和平公民的影响甚至施加影响的希望的破灭；街道可以帮助反对派变得激进，可以停止从社会国家向权力和军备国家的转变（即：逆转过程），可以逆转趋势，实现“更多的民主”——同时严格保持在制度内。和平但有好战性的对抗中，宪政国家作为一个强权国家得到加强，正是因为抗议依赖于“可教育性”（许多政治家确实谈到过在他们身上发生的“学习过程”），并且社会上根本不想也不能拥有反对国家的自主权。例外的是一些诗人、思想家和法学家，他们“职业性地”抓住了事情的实质并呼吁积极抵抗。尽管如此，他们自己也只是停留在半途，并且仅限于口头呼吁或风险较小的警察和法庭障碍。典型的例子是：一位著名的柏林法学教授在柏林自由大学的大礼堂中勇敢地宣布，在联邦议会通过导弹决议之后，“国家敌人”的概念应该被“积极定义”，但他没有告诉听众他们现在是否也应该采取敌对国家的行动。作为胜利者的宪政国家得到确认：它证实了自己的自由精神（对我来说难忘的是康拉德·科尔总理在著名的“人链”晚上对和平运动的道德严肃性表达了敬意，然后又冷淡地像往常一样微笑着补充说，政府将“不动摇”地继续其军备路线）；它向同样被抗议活动所关注的国际社会展示了自己的民主法治特性，并确认了什么是统治以及其如何被转化为政治力量。 我认为这是已发生在民事社会机构中的转变得到了验证——这并不是说忽视把反体制的和平运动转变为议会政治是非常令人印象深刻尽管失败了。但此时疑问再次出现，因为基本上对机构功能的批评得到了再次确认。毫无疑问，绿党和新反对派在联邦议会中的活动，使得议会生活发生了变化——至少是暂时性的，达成了原始运动并非旨在实现的结果：所谓议会及其系统的提升。并不只有绿党议员开始喜爱这个机构。绿党试图为和平运动提供所谓的议会支持的热情、投入和坚持，值得认可和支持，但这又一次导致了对现状的合法化。联邦议会以一种全新且不应得的光彩闪耀，而其传递职责没有丝毫改变。即使是“叛逆的青年”也在辩论中看到了自己的影子。对这场多姿多彩的活动的兴趣正在增长——到了如此程度，以至于保守派对绿党所希望的“另一种”共和国的怀疑变得不可信：绿党在议会中的存在并未产生不稳定影响，相反，它把一些持不同政见的社会群体带回到了宪政体系中。就像当年的社会民主党在所谓的资本主义病床旁，如今的绿党——尽管无意中——充当了其他WISE批评的秩序的支柱。社会上的反对派（包括我自己）非常高兴地看到，在德意志联邦共和国及其机构中再次讨论了犀利的问题。然而，权力，宫殿则继续使用旧字体。 这是进一步转变得到的第二次验证。出于无知，但也出于希望和幻想，新反对派接受了权力的战略路线。决定以国家政治活动的形式行动：作为一个政党和一个议会党团，这是许多人期待、希望并热切呼唤的，这再次滋养了对政治和国家的错误理解——然而，这种理解确实有助于可能的基本反对派运动的整合。两者：政治和国家，被视为可随意操纵的实体，其中似乎只有一件事重要，那就是谁决定并掌握它们。（这就是Joachim Hirsch所谓的“夺权”找到了它正确的位置。）在这种缺乏所有历史经验和理论认识的观点中，人们简单地忘记了，政治形态只是特定社会内容的形式；所谓经济和政治的相互依赖绝不意味着可以收买政客（来自其他路线）。在这种相互依赖中，一种生产方式与国家形态结合在一起——更准确地说：资本主义生产方式与国家形态结合。退出工业社会吗？Pietro Ingrao现在也再次谈论退出资本主义，无论是公有还是私有。但聪明的Ingrao知道这在政治上意味着什么。因此，他（再次）变成了“Movimentista”。因为，退出资本主义（用资产阶级的话说：退出工业社会）并进入议会主义——这是个悖论。谁如果支持特定的政治形态，就应该有勇气接受其经济基础。Joseph Huber当之无愧地受到尊敬，当他——作为议会战略的坚定支持者——表示他对资本主义没有任何异议。如此，社会上的分歧组织在广泛领域从和平运动到替代经济，不无自豪和愉悦的反对精神，进入了国家，遵循既定的游戏规则，并将自身转变为制度策略不可或缺的一部分。因此，肯定是绿党无意中实现了回归到资产阶级国家的真正主体的纯粹统治。“少点国家，多点市场。”在过去二十年中，宪政国家的制度战略是否取得了成果，这甚至不是一个解释的问题。它比好心人强大得多。只有在柏林另类名单中，对政治的实践批评转化为前述“阶级斗争论坛”的消极批判性存在，才能短暂地形成一种形式。"},{"instruction":"请将“Ansonsten scheint mir die strategische Rechnung voll aufzugehen: Statt eine Fundamentalopposition zu sein, erfüllen die Grünen die Aufgabe aller institutionskonformen Opposition: die mögliche Rebellion zur Ordnung zu rufen und in die Ordnung zurückzuholen. Wie vormals die Sozialdemokratie. Nur ist der Lauf der Welt, durch die technologische Entwicklung bedingt und zur Reduktion von Komplexitäten, also zur Vereinfachung neigend, schneller geworden. Die politischen Organisationen der Arbeiterbewegung in der II. Internationale brauchten im vorigen Jahrhundert einige Jahrzehnte, um die Frage zu klären, ob ein Sozialdemokrat (oder in Frankreich ein Sozialist) Minister in einem bürgerlichen (oder in Deutschland herzoglichen) Kabinett werden dürfe. Einige sprachen vom Verrat an der proletarischen Revolution, andere vom Possibi- lismus - schon damals also vom möglichen alternativen Ge-brauch der verfassungsmäßigen Institutionen. Bei den Grünen stellte sich die Frage der Ministeriabilität schon nach zwei Jah-ren. Wiederholt sich die Geschichte abermals als Komödie? Das Ganze will heißen: Eine Kommemoration kann nicht stattfinden. Der Transformation der Demokratie kann nicht bloß gedacht werden, weil die Transformation der Demokratie immer noch weiter geht. So weit zur Aktualität. Zwei Schlußbemerkungen nebst zusätzlichen Überlegungen Erstens: Während der Wirtschaftskrise der 30er Jahre wurde darüber diskutiert, ob es sich um eine Krise des Systems oder im System handle. Die damalige Krise zeigte am Ende ihren sozusagen ordnungsgemäßen zyklischen Charakter. Das Kapital konnte sich regenerieren, die Akkumulation auf der bekannten „höheren Stufenleiter“ wieder anlaufen, die Arbeitslosigkeit durch die höheren Anforderungen an die Warenproduktion absorbiert werden. Bei der heutigen Krise stellt sich nach meiner Mutmaßung die Frage anders. Die Ankurbelung der Akkumulation (bürgerlich gesprochen: die gebesserte Konjunkturlage) und die Erhöhung der Masse produzierter Güter läßt die Massenarbeitslosigkeit nicht verschwinden. Die Lösung der Krise gerät einseitig: Das Kapital erholt sich, die Arbeit bleibt auf der Straße. Das „magische Viereck“ ist endgültig gesprengt. Die Krise ist nicht mehr zyklisch, sondern endemisch und hat sich von einer möglichen Wachstumsrate losgemacht. Das will heißen: Selbst die (lang ersehnte) Erhöhung der Wachstumsrate löst die Probleme nicht. Die kapitalistisch produzierenden Ge-sellschaften müssen sich mit der permanenten Arbeitslosigkeit, mit der Marginalisierung großer Bevölkerungsgruppen, mit der Weiterbildung von Armutszonen abfinden. Bei allen Änderungen scheint am Kern der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise sich nichts verändert zu haben. „Es kommt hierin zum Vorschein, daß bei dem Übermaße des Reichtums die bürgerliche Gesellschaft nicht reich genug ist, d.h. an dem ihr eigentümlichen Vermögen nicht genug besitzt, dem Übermaße der Armut und der Erzeugung des Pöbels zu steuern“ (Hegel, Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts, § 245). Hegel fügte bekanntlich hinzu, nur der Staat könne die bürgerliche Gesellschaft aus diesem Widerspruch hinüberholen in eine ihre Existenz garantierende Ordnung. Daß es heute so weit kommen würde, hatte der italienische (bürgerliche) Nationalökonom De Cecco schon in der Zeit vermutet, als die erste große Weltwährungskrise kam und die schöne Welt von Bretton Woods in die Brüche ging: Der Kapitalismus würde sich nicht mehr erholen, würde vielmehr von Krise zu Krise weiter existieren - dank einer besonderen Politik des Staates. Die endemische Krise hat für die politische Form der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft Folgen, die die Tendenz der 50er und 60er Jahre verstärken, und die eingeleiteten Veränderungen erhärten. Gerät die Gesellschaft an ihrer Basis, der Ökonomie (wozu nach meiner Erkenntnis auch die ordnungsgemäße Klassen-struktur gehört), aus den Fugen, so muß sie politisch wieder zusammengefügt werden. Die jetzige Lage der kapitalistischen Wirtschaft fordert in noch stärkerem Maße als vor zwanzig Jahren die Transformation des Verfassungsstaats. Das Problem der Symbiose von Ökonomie und Politik, das tiefer greifen dürfte als bis zur Bonner Herrenausstattung, gewann inzwischen neue Dimensionen und entwickelte auch neue Methoden. Ein bekanntes Beispiel: Was harmlos als Informatik in die Diskussion und in die Wirklichkeit eingeführt wurde und vor dessen Ausuferung alle Moralisten warnen, hat in der Tat Innova- torisches geschaffen. Die Informatik und deren Ausdehnung höhlt die letzten Reste und - sofern diese sich in die Institutionen begeben - die letzten Hoffnungen der konkreten Präsenz der Massen in der Politik aus; verschärft andererseits die Forderung des ökonomischen Systems (der Produktionsweise) nach der Geschlossenheit der Machtzentren, so wie sie praktisch die Machtzentralisierung fördert. Darin ähnelt die Informatik der Akkumulation: Sie ist Mittel und Zweck zugleich. Hannah Arendt hat in ihrer letzten Schrift12 sich mit diesem, politisch wie technologisch bedingten Ausschluß der Bevölkerung aus den Zentren wichtiger Entscheidungen, also: aus dem Palast, befaßt. Ihr Urteil fällt dabei noch schärfer aus als das meinige. Dort, wo ich lediglich Involution zum autoritären Staat feststelle, in der die bürgerlichen Einrichtungen der Macht funktional verändert, in ihrer konstitutionellen Form aber mehr oder we-niger intakt bleiben, wittert Hannah Arendt das Aufkommen eines neuen Totalitarismus. Sie geht in ihrer Darstellung aller-dings nicht aus von einer Analyse der Reproduktionsprobleme und der ständigen Anpassung des Staates an die Erfordernisse der Gesellschaft und an die neuen Forderungen der Ökonomie: Sie argumentiert nach guter bürgerlicher Methode auf der an-thropologisch-moralischen Ebene, auf der in der Tat die von ihr gesehenen Gefahren als düstere Zukunft erscheinen: Den immer stärkeren Mangel an Einflußmöglichkeit der Bevölkerung auf die Politik - bis hin zur totalen Aussperrung - führt sie auf einen Degenerationsprozess des politischen Systems und der Politiker zurück. Daß es Degenerationserscheinungen gibt, läßt sich nicht abstreiten. Sie treffen aber nicht die ganze Wirklichkeit der Veränderungen in der politischen Form. Selbst ohne degenerierte Politiker und degenerierte Institutionen kommt die heutige Gesellschaft aus strukturellen Gründen um die autoritäre Involution nicht herum - wenn die fundamentale Opposition sich damit abfindet. (In diesem besonderen Sinn und als Versuch des Einbruchs in die Tendenz ist es durchaus richtig, die 60er Bewegung als antiautoritär zu bezeichnen. Sie zeigte freilich selbst zu wenig libertäre Züge.13) Zweitens und klassisch ausgedrückt: Der bürgerliche Verfassungsstaat, das heißt: Die politische Form der kapitalistischen Produktions- und Reproduktionsverhältnisse hat alles Emanzipatorische abgestreift und entwickelt von sich aus und innerhalb ihrer Einrichtungen nichts mehr Innovatorisch-Humanes. Sie zeigt zunehmend die gleiche zerstörerische Wirkung, die an ihrer Basis die Produktionsweise und ihre Zielsetzung kennzeichnen. Emanzipation, gesellschaftliche Autonomie können nur noch - auf der Suche nach neuen Organisationsformen der Reproduktion ohne politischen Charakter (ohne Herrschaft und Macht, ohne Palast) - außerhalb der staatlichen Instanzen, Organe und Einrichtungen gefunden werden. Die Utopie der „Gesellschaft der Freien und Gleichen“ (Marx) kann nicht als Gesetzesvorlage weder oppositioneller noch regierender Fraktionen in den Bundestag eingebracht werden. Marx hat uns freilich und leider nur die Aufgabe und das Problem, nicht die Lösung hinterlassen. Die Aufgabe mag zugleich als Anleitung dienen - Genaueres müssen wir selbst finden. Der kategorische Imperativ (oder Marx als Kantianer) gilt nach wie vor: Es sind „alle Verhältnisse umzuwerfen, in denen der Mensch ein erniedrigtes, ein geknechtetes, ein verlassenes, ein verächtliches Wesen ist“ (Marx, Zwr Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie. Einleitung). Marx geht aber über die Kantsche Moralkategorie der subjektiven Befreiung hinaus, holt Hegel herein und überholt ihn - und zielt auf die objektive Befreiung hin: Die Massen („die Proletarier“) ... „befinden sich ... auch im direkten Gegensatz zu der Form, in der die Individuen der Gesellschaft sich bisher einen Gesamtausdruck gaben, zum Staat, und müssen den Staat stürzen, um ihre Persönlichkeit durchzusetzen“ {Deutsche Ideologie, 1. Band, Kommunismus. Produktion der Verkehrsform selbst; Schlußsatz). ”翻译为中文","output":"否则，我认为战略计划完全奏效：绿党没有成为一个根本性的反对派，而是完成了所有符合体制的反对派所应完成的任务：召回可能的叛乱，并将其带回秩序之中。就像从前的社会民主党一样。只不过，由于技术发展的原因，世界运行的速度变得更快，趋向于简化复杂性。在上个世纪，工人运动的政治组织在第二国际中需要几十年时间来解决一个社会民主党人（或在法国的一个社会主义者）是否可以成为资产阶级（或在德国的公爵）内阁的部长的问题。一些人谈论背叛了无产阶级革命，其他人讨论可能性——因此，当时就已经讨论通过对宪法机构的可能的替代性使用。而对于绿党来说，成为部长的问题在两年后就已经提出。难道历史又一次以喜剧的形式重演吗？ 这一切意味着：无法进行纪念。民主的转变不能仅仅被思考，因为民主的转变仍在继续。至此为止的现实性。 两个结论性评论和额外的思考 首先：在30年代的经济危机期间，人们讨论它是系统性危机还是系统内危机。当时的危机最终显示出其所谓的正常循环特性。资本能够再生，积累在“更高阶梯”上重新开始，失业通过对商品生产的更高要求被吸收。在当今的危机中，我的假设是问题有所不同。资本积累的刺激（用资产阶级的话来说：改善的经济形势）和增加的商品量并没有使大规模失业消失。危机的解决变得片面：资本恢复，但劳动仍在街头。所谓的“魔法四边形”最终被打破。危机不再是周期性的，而是成为了地方性的，并且已经与可能的增长率脱钩。这意味着：即使是（长期期待的）增长率的提升也无法解决问题。资本主义生产的社会必须适应持续的失业，大量人口的边缘化，贫困区域的扩大。尽管经历了所有变化，资本主义生产方式的核心似乎并未发生变化。“这里显示出，在巨大财富的情况下，资产阶级社会不够富有，即缺乏其特有的财富，以至于无法对抗贫困的过度和拜物教的产生”（黑格尔，《法哲学原理》，§ 245）。众所周知，黑格尔补充说，只有国家能够将资产阶级社会从这种矛盾中带入一种保证其存在的秩序中。 意大利（资产阶级）国民经济学家De Cecco在第一次世界货币危机来临并且美好的布雷顿森林体系破裂时就曾预见到今天会出现这种情况：资本主义将不再恢复，而是会继续通过国家的特殊政策从一次危机走向另一次危机。地方性危机对资产阶级社会的政治形式有着影响，加强了50年代和60年代的趋势，并加固了所启动的变化。 如果社会在其基础上，即经济上（我的理解中这也包括了正常的阶级结构）出现混乱，那么它必须通过政治重新组合在一起。当今资本主义经济的状况比二十年前更加要求宪政国家的转变。经济和政治的共生问题可能比波恩的男装更加深刻，其间获得了新的维度并也发展了新的方法。一个著名的例子：所谓的信息技术被轻松引入讨论和现实中，并且所有道德家都警告其泛滥，实际上创造了创新。信息技术及其扩展削弱了群众在政治中的具体存在的最后残余——只要这些存在进入机构——和最后的希望；另一方面，它加剧了经济系统（生产方式）对权力中心闭合性的要求，正如它实际上促进了权力中心化。在这方面，信息技术类似于积累：它同时是手段和目的。汉娜·阿伦特在她的最后一部著作中关注了这种政治和技术导致的人民被排除在重要决策中心之外，即：被排除在宫殿之外的问题。她的判断比我的还要严厉。在那里，我只是确定了向威权国家的退化，在那里资产阶级的权力机构在功能上被改变，但在其宪法形式上或多或少保持完整，汉娜·阿伦特嗅到了新总统制的出现。然而，她的论述并不是基于对再生产问题的分析和国家对社会需求和经济新要求的持续适应，她是按照良好的资产阶级方法从人类学-道德层面上进行论证的，在这个层面上，她所看到的危险看起来确实是暗淡的未来：她将日益减少的人民对政治的影响力——直至完全排除——归因于政治系统和政治家的退化过程。不能否认有退化现象的存在。但它们并没有触及政治形式变化的整个实际情况。即使没有退化的政治家和机构，当今社会由于结构原因也无法避免威权的退化——如果基本反对派接受这一点。（在这个特定意义上，将60年代的运动称为反威权是完全正确的，作为一种突破趋势的尝试。它当然自身表现得并不够自由。） 第二，用经典的表达方式：资产阶级宪政国家，也就是资本主义生产和再生产关系的政治形式，已经摒弃了所有的解放特性，并且在其机构内部不再自发发展出任何创新的人道特质。它日益展示了与其基础上的生产方式及其目标所具有的相同的破坏性效应。解放、社会自治只能在寻找新的、没有政治特性（没有统治和权力，没有宫殿）的再生产组织形式的过程中，在国家机关、机构和设施之外找到。“自由平等的社会”（马克思）的乌托邦不可能作为反对派或执政派的法案提交到联邦议会。遗憾的是，马克思只留给我们任务和问题，而不是解决方案。任务本身也许可以作为指导——我们必须自己寻找更多的答案。范畴命题（或作为康德主义者的马克思）仍然有效：必须“推翻所有使人成为卑贱、被奴役、被抛弃、被鄙视的存在的关系”（马克思，《对黑格尔法哲学批判引言》）。马克思超越了康德的主观解放的道德范畴，引入并超越了黑格尔——并指向客观解放：群众（“无产者”）......“也处于直接对立之中，对抗个体到目前为止以社会整体形式给自己的表达，即国家，他们必须推翻国家，以实现他们的个性”（《德意志意识形态》卷一，共产主义。自身生产的交往形式；结语）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Diese Verlötung von kategorischem Imperativ und Negation des Staats macht die zwei geschichtlichen Formen der Befreiung zu einer Einheit: Die Freiheit eines Jeden wird erst dann Wirklichkeit, wenn der Zwangscharakter der Gesellschaft, in der Form Staat kodifiziert (der „Form der Zusammenfassung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft“ - Marx, Grundrisse. Einleitung) überwunden, abgeschafft wird. Welcher Staat es nun ist, der der Lockeschen Fiktion, der Burkeschen Realität oder den Staat, auf den wir uns technologisch-politisch zubewegen, ist gleichgültig. Die politische Frage der Linken (eine politökonomische gibt es längst nicht mehr: Der Kapitalismus, in der privaten wie in der staatlichen Fassung, gesund oder ungesund, verfault oder blühend, ist ohnehin entlarvt) also betrifft den „guten“ oder den „besseren“, mit mehr Demokratie ausgestatteten Staat nicht: die Frage nach dem erträglichen oder geringeren Übel. Niemandem wird das Recht abgestritten, ihn immer noch als Mittel der Emanzipation zu sehen, ihn „von innen heraus“ verbessern zu wollen. Das ist fraglos historische linke Position, nur nicht mehr unser aktuelles Problem. Rhodus, oder der Punkt, bei dem es zu tanzen gilt, um die Verhältnisse zum Tanzen zu bringen, ist für uns woanders. Die Frage der Linken sieht das religiöse Be-kenntnis zum demokratischen Staat, zum Rechtsstaat, zum be-sten aller Staaten überhaupt, nicht vor. Sie ist vielmehr die theoretische der Erkenntnis, ob und wie Emanzipation möglich wird, ob und wie die Massen zum emanzipatorischen Bewußtsein kommen: das Bedürfnis nach Freiheit zum Bewußtsein bringen. Und vor allem: Ob sie es auch wollen. Aus der Erkenntnis, daß der Kapitalismus das Leben zerstört und sein Staat die Zerstörung institutionalisiert, kann der Schritt ins Emanzipatorische nicht unmittelbar vollzogen noch die politische Zwangsanstalt negiert werden. Es muß allerhand mit materiellen Interessen und mit Bedürfnissen vermittelt werden, bis die Massen von sich aus das rationale Ziel der eigenen Befreiung von der Irrationalität einer blinden, teils auch bequemen Bevormundung und Ausbeutung vorziehen. Dazu gehört auch Aufklärung, als Teil der Maulwurfs-Arbeit. Wir müssen uns dem schwierigen Geschäft zuwenden, dem Volk Mitteilung zu machen über das wirkliche Wesen der Verfassung (Kant), und neue Wege suchen. Denn der alte Weg, von Plato über Fichte bis zu Lenin: Man müsse die Massen zu ihrem Glück und zur Freiheit zwingen, ist nicht nur theoretisch brüchig und intellektuell eine Legitimationsideologie der Macht. Viel schlimmer: Er läßt alles bei den alten Verhältnissen (mit ausgewechseltem politischem oder gesellschaftlichem Personal), involutiert auf jeweils andere Weise lustig weiter. Im Übrigen steht es außer Frage, daß die Transformation der Demokratie heute anders geschrieben werden müßte - genau so wie die Bibel, Aristoteles Ethik, Hegels Phänomenologie des Geistes, selbstredend Marxens Kapital, Courths-Mahlers Romane und Salgaris „Sandocan alla riscossa“. Ich nehme nicht einmal Collodis „Pinocchio“, also einen zeitlosen Klassiker aus; und mache offensichtlich „di tutta l’erba un fascio“ [ital. Redensart: Kraut und Rüben zusammenwerfen. Agnoili meint hier gegen Kraushaar: Das Kräuterbündel (fascio) hat nicht mit dem Liktorbündel des italienischen fascismo zu tun.] (wobei ich Wolfgang Kraushaar daran erinnern möchte, daß dieser italienische Spruch nichts mit Faschismus zu tun hat). Die Terminologie der Transformation wäre anders, auch der Inhalt könnte hie und da anders aussehen. Man wird älter und weiser - also wäre die Argumentation stellenweise schärfer, die Kritik der Politik fiele kompromißloser und erbarmungsloser aus. Vorläufiger Beschluß Maulwurfs-Arbeit also und mühsame Aufklärung: Die übliche Minderheitsposition gegen die sprechende Mehrheit; ob auch gegen die schweigende, sei dahingestellt: Da sie schweigt, bleibt es durchaus fraglich, was sie wirklich meint. Befreiung ist ein unmittelbares Bedürfnis, das sich zum Beispiel in dem stillen Wunsch eines jeden Untergebenen (Angestellten, Arbeiter, Studenten, Assistenten, Bundestagshinterbänkler und der übrigen Masse der Abhängigen) konkretisiert, dem jeweiligen Vorgesetzten einmal einen Fußtritt zu verpassen (ich bitte um Nachsicht ob der unwissenschaftlichen Ausdrucksweise); oder in der klammheimlichen Freude des sogenannten kleinen Mannes und der nie erwähnten kleinen Frau, wenn großen Frauen und Männern gesellschaftlich Unerfreuliches widerfährt: Machtverlust, Prestige-Einbuße, Sturz vom Thron. Konserva-tive Gemüter, ohnehin durch Verhaltenszwang daran gebunden, edel zu denken, werden von der Niedertracht des Pöbels sprechen. In diesem Zusammenhang halte ich es eher für angebracht, an die Mescalero-Botschaft zu erinnern, die 1977 durch allerlei unglückliche polizeiliche und staatsanwaltliche Maßnahmen glücklicherweise allgemein bekannt wurde - die List der Vernunft (Hegel). „Eine Gesellschaft ohne Terror und Gewalt (wenn auch nicht ohne Aggression und Militanz), eine Gesellschaft ohne Zwangsarbeit (wenn auch nicht ohne Plackerei)“. Dies wäre die Reproduktion ohne objektiven Zwang, die bekannte Abschaffung des „politischen Charakters“ der öffentlichen Gewalt (Marx) - das Verschwinden des Staats, dessen Funktionen von der Gesellschaft wieder eingeholt würden. Utopie und Sinnlosigkeit und Verrückung ins menschlich nicht Erreichbare? Wem dies alles Utopie bleibt, oder nicht einmal als Orientierungspunkt gesellschaftliche Praxis bleibt, soll schon aus Gründen der Denkdisziplin den Weg des Robert Michel gehen und für einen offen autoritär verfaßten Staat eintreten. Viele Linken gehen indessen einen anderen, kompromißreichen und beschwerlichen Weg. Ohne den totalen Frieden mit dem Verfassungsstaat zu schließen (daher der Vorwurf, sie wollten schließlich doch „eine andere Republik), finden sie sich mit dessen Politik ab und versuchen, aus ihr Menschliches, Emanzipatorisches herauszuholen; genau so wie sie versuchen, die zugrunde liegende Produktionsweise menschlicher, sozialer und umweltfreundlicher zu machen. Ein verständliches Verhalten, welches zu schelten unangebracht wäre. Denn: Sollte die radikale Umwälzung weder gemacht werden noch sich ereignen (und viele sind davon überzeugt), was bliebe denn anders übrig, als zu reformieren, zu reparieren, zu humanisieren? Ist die Lohnarbeit ein ewiges Gesetz, so gehört es zur linken Pflicht, den Arbeitsplatz zu humanisieren. Das Irrationale an dieser Perspektive liegt in ihrem Widerspruch zu den wirklichen Verhältnissen: Alle Humanisierung setzt das Ende des inhumanen Zustands voraus; wirkliche Reformen setzen sich erst durch die erfolgreiche Revolution durch: „La nostra riforma e la rivolu- zione.“ [„Unsere Reform ist die Revolution.“] Dies waren aber Parolen und Positionen der 60erJahre. Zwanzig Jahre danach will ich also an den Reformern keine Schelte üben, ihre Illusionen vielmehr loben, sofern sie nicht richtig übergelaufen sind und dabei die zwar nicht richtige, aber doch bittere Erkenntnis des geringeren Übels zu einem freudigen Bekenntnis umstilisieren. Nur dürfen die linken Reformer eine Eigentümlichkeit der gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung nicht vergessen. Verbesserungen kommen nicht von selbst, sie müssen den Herrschenden immer abgetrotzt werden. Und häufig lassen sie sich nur verwirklichen, nur wenn mit der Möglichkeit des „Schlimmeren“ gewunken wird: das linksradikale Gespenst als Stachel eines möglichen Fortschritts. Fehlte der Hinweis auf die mögliche Gefährdung durch „Schlimmeres“, sähe keine Macht der Welt ein, warum etwas geändert, humanisiert werden sollte. Verbesserungen liegen hingegen nahe: Sie sind systemfunktional. In der Tat eigentümlich: Wenn links von den Linken, die man traditionell zu nennen pflegt, nichts ist, sinkt die traditionelle Linke zur Kraftlosigkeit herab und in die Systemgrenze der nützlichen Opposition - oder wird selbst zum „Extrem“ erklärt. Als in Italien die Autonomia operaia zerschlagen wurde, hörte in Turin Agnelli auf, nach einem kommunistischen Bürgermeister zu rufen; das Interesse der bürgerlichen Parteien an einer Zusammenarbeit mit der KPI erlosch; die scala mobile [gleitende Anpassung von Lohn an die Inflation] kam dem Stillstand nahe.”翻译为中文","output":"将范畴命令律与否定国家相融合，使得解放的两种历史形式成为一体：个体的自由仅在社会的强制性质——即以国家形式编码的（马克思在《 Grundrisse》引言中称之为“资产阶级社会的汇总形式”）被克服、废除时才能成为现实。无论是锁定的幻想、伯克的现实，还是我们正以技术政治方式迈向的国家，这都无关紧要。左翼的政治问题（一个政治经济问题已经不复存在：无论是私有还是国有，资本主义已然暴露无遗，无论它是健康还是不健康，腐烂还是繁荣）并不关涉“好”或“更好”的、配备了更多民主的国家，也不是关于可忍受或较小恶的问题。没有人会否认视其为解放手段、希望“从内部”改进它的权利。这无疑是历史上左翼的立场，只是不再是我们当前的问题。罗德岛，或者是我们必须跳舞的点，为了使条件发生变化，对我们来说在别处。左翼的问题不见得涉及对民主国家、法治国家、或者总体上最好的国家的宗教信仰。它更是一个理论问题，关于是否以及如何实现解放，是否以及如何让大众达到解放的意识：将对自由的需求带入意识。最重要的是：他们是否也想要这样。认识到资本主义在摧毁生活，而其国家在制度化破坏后，不能直接跨入解放之中，也不能否定政治性强制机构。必须通过物质利益和需求进行调解，直到大众自发地偏向于自我解放的理性目标，摆脱盲目的、部分也是舒适的被监管和剥削。 这也需要启蒙，作为地下工作的一部分。我们必须致力于艰难的任务，向人民传达关于宪法真实本质的信息（康德），并寻找新的途径。因为从柏拉图到费希特再到列宁的老路：强迫大众为了他们的幸福和自由，不仅在理论上脆弱，在知识上也是权力的合法化意识形态。更糟糕的是：它让一切保持旧有状态（只是更换了政治或社会人员），以不同方式愉快地继续进化。 此外，毫无疑问，今天的民主转型需要以不同的方式来书写——就像《圣经》、亚里士多德的《伦理学》、黑格尔的《精神现象学》、当然还有马克思的《资本论》、库尔特-马勒的小说和萨尔加里的《土耳其人萨洛卡恩》一样。我甚至不排除《匹诺曹》这样的永恒经典；显然我是在“混为一谈”（意大利俗语，指不加区分地将一切混在一起。Agnoili在此提醒Wolfgang Kraushaar，这个意大利俗语与法西斯主义无关）。转型的术语会有所不同，内容也可能在这里那里有所不同。随着年龄增长变得更加睿智，所以论证会更加锐利，对政治的批评会更加不妥协和无情。 初步结论 因此，地下工作和艰苦的启蒙：对抗多数声音的常规少数立场；至于是否也对抗沉默的大众，则有待商榷：因为它们沉默，所以究竟意味着什么仍然充满疑问。解放是一个直接的需求，比如每个下属（员工、工人、学生、助理、联邦议会后排议员以及其他大量依赖者）想要踢一脚其上司的潜在愿望（请原谅我的非学术表达）；或者所谓的普通人和从未被提及的普通妇女在社会上的大人物遭遇不幸时的偷偷喜悦：权力的失去、声望的损失、跌落宝座。保守的心态，因为行为约束而倾向于高尚思考，会谈论乌合之众的卑鄙。在这种情况下，我更倾向于提醒人们1977年通过各种不幸的警察和检察官行为而幸运地为大众所知的Mescalero信息——理性的诡计（黑格尔）。\\"一个没有恐怖和暴力的社会（尽管不无侵略和激进），一个没有强迫劳动的社会（尽管不无辛劳）\\"。这将是没有客观强制的再生产，众所周知的“政治性”公共权力的废除（马克思）——国家的消失，其功能被社会重新吸收。乌托邦、无意义和向人类无法达到的事物的疯狂转变？对于那些这一切仍然是乌托邦，或者甚至不作为社会实践的指向点的人，出于思维纪律的原因，应该走Robert Michel的路，支持一个公开的威权状态。 然而，许多左翼选择了另一条充满妥协和艰难的道路。他们没有与宪政国家彻底和解（因此有人指责他们最终想要\\"另一种共和国\\"），而是接受了其政策，并试图从中提取人性、解放性的东西；正如他们试图使潜在的生产方式变得更人性化、更社会化、更环保一样。这是一种可理解的行为，无需责备。因为：如果既不能制造也不发生根本性变革（许多人确信这一点），除了改革、修补、人道主义化外，还能做什么呢？如果雇佣劳动是永恒的法则，那么使工作场所人性化就是左翼的责任。这种观点的非理性之处在于它与实际情况的矛盾：所有的人性化都预设了不人道状态的结束；真正的改革只有在成功的革命之后才能实施：\\"我们的改革就是革命。\\"但这些是60年代的口号和立场。二十年后，我不想批评改革者，反而赞美他们的幻想，只要他们没有彻底转变，并在此过程中将较小恶变为欢快的信仰。 不过，左翼改革者不应忘记社会发展的一个特点。改善不会自发发生，必须总是从统治者那里争取到。而且，通常只有在可能出现“更糟糕的事情”的威胁时才能实现：左翼激进幽灵作为可能进步的刺激。如果没有对“更糟糕的事情”可能带来的威胁的提示，世界上没有任何力量会认为有必要进行改变或人道化。改善显然是: 它们对系统是功能性的。确实很奇怪：当左边没有传统上所说的左翼时，传统的左翼就会变得无力，并沦为有益的反对派示范——或被宣布为“极端”。在意大利瓦解自治工人运动时，阿涅利在都灵不再呼吁共产党市长；与意大利共产党合作的资产阶级党派的兴趣消失了；与通货膨胀挂钩的工资调整几乎停止了。"},{"instruction":"请将“Hätte es die Gefährdung der konstituierten Ordnung oder deren Zerstörung durch die Rebellion (gegen Götter und Helden und Herren) nicht gegeben, wären die Menschen nicht zu dem Begriff gekommen, daß die Herren „non esse coelo demissi“ [nicht vom Himmel gesandt wurden (Vico)], kröchen wir immer noch auf allen Vieren.

This particular style, known for its dynamic and expressive capabilities, taps into the broad history of Japanese art, drawing from practices like sumi-e and ukiyo-e. While sumi-e—an ink wash painting technique—emphasizes the beauty of each stroke and the depth of black ink on white paper, ukiyo-e, though more commonly associated with woodblock prints, also revels in narrative richness, portraying scenes from history, folklore, and the floating world. Creating a piece within this framework that incorporates intricate brushwork and the setting sun as a backdrop to samurai legends requires not only technical skill but a deep understanding of the symbolism and aesthetics prevalent in Japanese culture. Here’s a mental picture of what such a piece might convey: **The Canvas:** Imagine a piece of shoji paper, its surface textured, ready to drink in the ink. The paper\'s ability to absorb and blur the ink is fundamental, allowing for the gradation of tones that give the painting depth and dimension. **The Setting:** The scene unfolds under the glow of a setting sun, a common motif that symbolizes both the transience of life—a key theme in samurai philosophy—and the beauty of the moment. The sun\'s last rays streak across the sky, rendered in washes of ink diluted to different extents, creating a gradient from deep black through grays to the untouched white of the paper, suggesting the presence of light. **Samurai Figure:** Dominating the scene is the silhouette of a samurai, his posture one of serene readiness, a testament to the bushido code, which values honor, courage, and stoicism. His armor, detailed through precise, controlled strokes, contrasts with the fluid and expansive treatment of the background. Each plate of the armor, the folds of his clothing, and the features of his exposed face (if shown) demand meticulous brushwork, reflecting the strength, dignity, and the heavy weight of duty that characterizes the samurai. **Intricate Details:** The intricate brushwork shines in elements like the pattern of the samurai\'s kimono, the texture of his armor, and the accessories that signify his rank and prowess. These details, though they may be small, are pivotal for conveying the richness of this warrior\'s life and the era he embodies. **Foreground and Background:** Grass, trees, or perhaps the rough sea—elements often included to invoke the natural beauty of Japan—would frame the samurai, blending into the scene. The transition between the warrior and these elements is seamless, suggesting harmony between man and nature, a central value in Japanese aesthetics. The setting sun ties all these elements together, casting long shadows and bathing the entire scene in a warm, fading light that underscores the impermanence and the beauty of the warrior\'s path. Creating this scene would not just capture a moment in time; it would evoke the depth and breadth of the human experience as encapsulated by the samurai legends, resonating with themes of duty, beauty, nature, and the fleeting nature of life itself—all while showcasing the technical prowess and emotional depth achievable through the medium of Japanese ink drawing."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a rabbit that SCREAMED at the vet while it was getting put down (turns out it ran away just in time, it didn\'t need to, there was a misdiagnosis)","output":"In a small, vibrant town nestled between the rolling hills and lush forests, there lived a rabbit named Whiskers. Whiskers was not your ordinary rabbit; he was adventurous, daring, and possessed a personality so grand, it often felt too big for his small, fluffy body. He was the darling of his human family, the Bennetts, who doted on him and pampered him with all the love they had to offer. One day, Whiskers started acting oddly, refusing his favorite treats and spending most of his time lying down in his pen. Worried, the Bennetts took him to the local vet, a well-respected and kind-hearted doctor named Dr. Haversham. After a brief examination, Dr. Haversham looked concerned, his brow furrowed as he shared the unfortunate news. He suspected Whiskers had a rare and incurable condition, suggesting that the kindest course of action would be to put Whiskers down, sparing him from any suffering. The room fell silent, the air heavy with grief and disbelief. The Bennetts, heartbroken, agreed with trembling hearts, unable to bear the thought of Whiskers in pain. They said their tearful goodbyes, leaving Whiskers in Dr. Haversham\'s care for what was to be his final moment. But fate had other plans for Whiskers. As Dr. Haversham prepared for the procedure, something extraordinary happened. Whiskers, who had been quiet and lethargic until then, suddenly sprang to life with a burst of energy that surprised everyone in the room. With a loud SCREAM that echoed off the walls – a sound so uncharacteristic for a rabbit, yet filled with determination and a strong will to live – Whiskers leapt from the table and dashed towards the open window, his little heart pounding fiercely in his chest. Dr. Haversham and the staff chased after him, but Whiskers was quick and agile, his instincts fully awakened. With a mighty leap, he made it through the window and into the open, disappearing into the sprawling fields beyond with the speed of lightning. The Bennetts were informed about Whiskers\' escape and were both shocked and relieved. They organized search parties, putting up flyers and asking for help from their neighbors, but Whiskers was nowhere to be found. Days turned into weeks, and hope began to fade. Meanwhile, Whiskers embarked on an adventure of a lifetime. He explored the lush forests, made friends with other woodland creatures, and discovered hidden fields he never knew existed. He thrived in the wild, his health visibly improving with each passing day. The misdiagnosis became apparent through Whiskers\' vigor and zest for life, a stark contrast to the grim future that had been wrongly predicted for him. Finally, after many adventures, Whiskers decided it was time to return home. One morning, the Bennetts woke to find Whiskers at their doorstep, healthy, plump, and with a gleam in his eyes that spoke of the incredible journey he had been on. The family was overjoyed, tears of happiness rolling down their cheeks as they embraced their beloved pet. They took Whiskers back to Dr. Haversham, who was amazed by his recovery. After a thorough examination, Dr. Haversham confirmed that there had indeed been a misdiagnosis; Whiskers was completely healthy. Whiskers\' extraordinary escape and the loud SCREAM that had marked the beginning of his journey became a legendary tale in the town. It served as a reminder of the will to live against all odds and the miracles that can happen when fate takes an unexpected turn. And so, Whiskers lived out his days surrounded by love, with the lush fields and forests his to explore whenever adventure called. His story, a testament to the resilience and spirit of one small rabbit who refused to give up, remained etched in the hearts of all who knew of him."},{"instruction":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, realistic, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Coated Greeting Cards\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don\'t mention on resolutions, Don\'t include HTML or \'<br/>\' or \'<strong>\' for formatting only newline \' \', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Coated Greeting Cards: Samurai Legends at Sunset, Japanese Ink Art, Detailed Brushwork"},{"instruction":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, realistic, generate a 200 char length description that is personable and describe the {model} Coated Greeting card, include it being a great gift for people, collections or holiday, Material: 270gsm paper Four sizes, quantities and paper finishes to choose from Double-sided print Horizontal and vertical options available Blanks sourced from USA Envelopes included, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don\'t mention on resolutions, Don\'t include HTML or \'<br/>\' or \'<strong>\' for formatting only newline \' \', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Dive into the art of Japanese legends with the mesmerizing ink drawings of samurai set against a setting sun, captured on the exquisite {model} Coated Greeting Card.

Unfähig geworden, unter Regeln zu subsumieren, schließen sie aus dem erbärmlich-tragischen Scheitern einer geschichtlichen Antithese kurz auf die einzige Richtigkeit der nun geschichtslos gewordenen These. Ihnen erscheinen die kapitalistische Produktionsweise, neutral freie Marktwirtschaft genannt, und die ihr angemessene Form Staat, trügerisch unter der Sammelbezeichnung „Demokratie” angeführt, im Strahlenkranz des Wahren, Guten, Schönen. Von ihrem vorläufigen Erfolg und vom wundersamen Ende der Geschichte geblendet (ich kam anderswo schon darauf zu sprechen), meiden sie die Anstrengung der Vernunft und werden erbaulich. In der Konsequenz dieser Neuen Empfindsamkeit kehren sie ins Religiöse zurück und finden einen angemessenen neuen Gott. „Er gibt seinem alten Kameraden” - namentlich dem früher geliebten Vaterland - „mit dem Ellenbogen einen Stoß; und bauz paradauz, der Götze liegt am Boden” (Diderot, Rameaus Neffe; in Goethischer Übersetzung und in Hegelscher Zitierweise). Statt Erbauliches zu Produktion und Verfassung, wird hier Kritisches angemeldet. Eine ältere Kritik, wird man einwenden, die die allgemeine Wetterlage nicht ändern kann. Indessen: eine Kritik altert in dem gleichen Maß und mit der gleichen Geschwindigkeit, mit denen ihr Gegenstand als überholt gilt. In unserem Fall ist es offensichtlich anders: gerade der Gegenstand Kapitalismus und sein Staat ist nicht nur nicht überholt, hat vielmehr alles übrige überholt und weggeräumt. Er hat sich als siegreich durchgesetzt, damit aber auch seine Mängel, seine Fehler: sich selbst als Fehlkonstruktion bestätigt. Und daß das Ende des Gegenteils, die Falsifizierung des Staatskommunismus, die Perpetuierung des Kapitalismus mit sich bringe, das ist genau der Kurzschluß. Insofern ist meine Kritik weder alt noch neu; sie folgt ihrem Gegenstand in Permanenz auf dem Fuß. Zu den italienischen Aufsätzen einige kurze Hinweise. Abgesehen von der Arbeit über „Rechtsstaat und Spätkapitalismus”, handelt es sich um die Transskription von Vorträgen, die ich in Italien gehalten habe: in Neapel 1977 bei einem Seminar, das vom „Ausschuß für die Verteidigung politischer Gefangener” veranstaltet wurde; in Garda 1982 bei einer Konferenz der UIL (der sozialdemokratischen Gewerkschaft, aber vor Gewerkschaftern, die zum Teil auf Autonomie drängten); in Rom 1983 bei einem Internationalen Seminar über „Das politische Verbrechen”, veranstaltet von der Zeitschrift Critica del Diritto. Daß sie alle um das gleiche Thema kreisen, verdankt sich vermutlich dem Umstand, daß dies ohnehin mein Thema ist und daß ich offensichtlich zu den so genannten Kreisdenkern gehöre. Mir ist die Gnade nicht zuteil worden, aus immer neuen Einfällen immer neue innovatorische Theorien zu entwickeln. Den Übersetzerinnen und Übersetzern gilt nicht nur mein pflichtgemäßer Dank, sondern auch meine lebhafte Anerkennung für die mühevolle Arbeit, meine italienische Rhetorik in deutsche Sachlichkeit übertragen zu haben. Ich habe hie und da Änderungen vorgenommen, nicht in der Sache, sondern in der Sprache - teils um meine eigene Diktion ein wenig zu berücksichtigen; teils um die Argumente selbst ins Deutsche zu übersetzen. Sprache und Gesellschaft hängen zusammen; es gibt Sprachgebilde, die argumentativ nur in veränderter Form korrekt wiedergegeben werden können. Das gleiche gilt für die Metaphern, mit denen der italienische discorso (es ist schon nicht ganz richtig, ihn mit Diskurs wiederzugeben) gerne operiert. Da wird zum Beispiel aus einer italienischen „sede” (vielleicht einem Sessel) ein deutscher „Ort”. Schwieriger ist es mit den Begriffen. Von ihnen meint man irrtümlicherweise, sie besäßen Internationalität. Nicht einmal die Mathematik kann sprachliche Barrieren überwinden. Eine Lösung böte sich mit dem Gebrauch des Englischen an - aber eine schiefe Lösung, denn erstens ist Englisch in beklemmender Weise begriffsarm; und zweitens weiß ich dies nur von Anderen, da ich selbst des Englischen nicht mächtig bin. Einiges ließ ich weg: italienische Besonderheiten, die den deutschen Leser nicht interessieren; oder besondere Mitteilungen für den italienischen Leser über ihm unbekannte Sachverhalte, zum Beispiel in der Erläuterung grundgesetzlicher Bestimmungen. Zurück zur Sache. Auch die hier wieder vorgelegten Überlegungen bedürfen der einen oder anderen Richtigstellung, der Ergänzung, der Aktualisierung - eine Binsenwahrheit. Die Grundargumentation behält ihre Gültigkeit. Der Staat des Kapitals, mit ihm die Politik und die ihr zugrundeliegende Ökonomie haben den eingangs genannten Zusammenbruch unbeschadet, also unverändert überstanden. Sie haben vor der Erfolgskommission der Geschichte bestanden. Der Staat aber ist nach wie vor vor den Richterstuhl der Vernunft zu laden: als eben unverändert, unverbesserlich, rückfällig. Und das Kapital tummelt sich nun gänzlich uneingeschränkt in der Weltmarktgesellschaft und herrscht und subsumiert und zerstört. Es ist so barbarisch geblieben, daß selbst Freunde der gegebenen Zustände und Anbeter des patriotischen Götzen es „zivilisieren” möchten, übrigens „bis zur Unkenntlichkeit” - die neuzeitlichen Wirtschaftsmissionäre. Die radikale Änderung, nicht zum Besten, aber zu Menschlicherem rückt zur Zeit in die Ferne. Vorerst muß es bei der Negation bleiben. Und weil dem so ist, schlage ich das Alte zur Diskussion wieder vor, es der Aufmerksamkeit des Lesers angelegentlich empfehlend. San Quirico di Moriano, Herbst 1994 Destruktion als Bestimmung des Gelehrten in dürftiger Zeit „Die Freiheit der Lehre entbindet nicht von der Treue zur Verfassung” (GG 5,3). „Der Boden der freiheitlich-demokratischen Grundordnung” (Bundesverfassungsgericht). „Eine andere, dem Volke befohlene Verheimlichung ist die von der wahren Beschaffenheit der Konstitution “ (Immanuel Kant). „Das befohlene Stehen auf dem Boden entbindet nicht von der Pflicht, über die wahre Beschaffenheit des Bodens Mitteilung zu machen” (Agnoli). Vorab-Bemerkung Die Bestimmung des Gelehrten stammt - wie alle wissen - von Johann Gottlieb Fichte; auf die Dürftigkeit der Zeit wies seinerzeit Hölderlin hin. Fichtes Bestimmung erfolgte im Glauben an den Aufbruch einer neuen Zeit; Hölderlin fand die Zeit eher dürftig und fragte sich bekanntlich, was denn ein Dichter in einer solchen Zeit solle. In unserer Zeit bleibt die Dürftigkeit unsichtbar und fremd. Allenthalben herrscht bruchloser Aufbau. Wiederherstellung der Werte. Wiederfindung des Auslands, Entdeckung der Würde der Natur samt Tier und Pflanze. Brüche kommen zwar reichlich vor, aber in anderen Gegenden; und bestätigen derart unsere eigene, nie endenwollende Welle des Aufwärts. Oder anders: Ein Ende meldet sich doch an, kommt aus dem US-Amerikanischen und verkündet (eu-angelion), anders als Marx\' Traum vom Beginn der wirklichen Geschichte, die erreichte Geschichtslosig-keit: den Endsieg der westlichen Ordnung, von den Segnungen der Akkumulation bis zu den Errungenschaften des liberaldemokratischen Rechtsstaats. Die gelehrte Welt (also die Wissenschaften, die sich nicht um bare Chemikalien oder um physikalische Quantitäten kümmern, sondern um menschliche Zu- und Um- und Mißstände) bleibt hier nicht im Abseits. Sie wirkt kräftig mit an der Festigung des Ordnungsgefüges, der Wertesysteme, der kommunikativen Interaktionen; an der Etablierung der Neuen Staatsbürgerlichkeit, der Neuen Inner- und Äußerlichkeit, der Neuen Funktionalität. Sicher wie fast nie zuvor gilt die konstruktive Arbeit als die wahre Mission des Gelehrten: Die Vernunft wird bemüht, teils zur systematisch wohlgeordneten Vereinfachung von Gesamtzusammenhängen (Reduktion von Komplexität genannt), teils als Stifterin friedfertiger Kommunikation (der philosophischen Textverarbeitung der Informatik), teils und in genauer Umkehrung wird ihr der Kampf angesagt und aus Betroffenheit der freudige Sprung ins Spirituelle, in den Brei der Seele unternommen. Letzteres ist nicht der Rede wert. Bedenklicher ist schon, daß die Vernunft bei den neuen Aufklärern ihrer geschichtlichen Aufgabe beraubt wird. Unbotmäßiges anzustiften und das jeweils Infame (ob Kirche, Staat, Despotie oder sonstige Herrschaft) einfach zu zerstören - wie Voltaire zu sagen pflegte.”翻译为中文","output":"前言 苏维埃体制的崩溃（简称之，尽管真正的苏维埃在其中只扮演了名义上的角色）导致一些时代精神的代表人物的判断力崩溃。他们变得无法在规则之下进行归纳，从一个历史反对论的悲惨失败中草率地断定现在无历史的论述是唯一正确的。在他们看来，被中性地称为自由市场经济的资本主义生产方式，以及适合其形式的国家，错误地汇总在“民主”这一名称下，呈现在真理、美好、美丽的光环之中。他们被暂时的成功和历史的神奇终结所蒙蔽（我在其他地方已经谈到过这一点），回避理性的挑战，变得情绪化。在这种新的感性情绪的推动下，他们回归到宗教中，找到了一个合适的新神。“他用肘部推了一下他的老伙伴”——特指先前挚爱的祖国——“然后一声巨响，偶像倒在了地上”（狄德罗，《拉美的侄子》；歌德翻译，黑格尔引用方式）。 这里不是要讨论对生产和制度的启发性论述，而是提出批判。有人会反驳，这是一种过时的批评，无法改变总体的态势。然而，批评的过时程度与其对象被认为是过时的程度和速度相同。在我们的案例中，情况显然不同：资本主义及其国家这一主题不仅没有过时，反而超越了其他一切，清除了一切。它已经取得了胜利，但同时也证实了它的缺陷，它的错误：证实了自身是一个设计失败。而且，国家社会主义的终结，资本主义的永续延续，正是这种错觉。在这方面，我的批评既不新鲜也不陈旧；它持续不断地紧随其对象而来。 对于意大利文章的几点简要说明。除了关于“法治国家和后资本主义”的工作外，它们是我在意大利举行的演讲的文字记录：1977年，在那不勒斯举办的一个由“政治犯辩护委员会”组织的研讨会上；1982年，在加尔达举办的一次UIL（社会民主工会，但面对部分追求自主的工会成员）会议上；1983年，在罗马举办的关于“政治犯罪”的国际研讨会上，该会议由《批判法律》杂志组织。它们都围绕着相同的主题展开，可能是因为这本来就是我的主题，而且我显然属于所谓的循环思考者。我没有得到那种通过不断的新灵感来不断发展新的革新理论的恩赐。 对于译者们，我不仅要表达我应尽的感谢，还要对他们把我的意大利修辞转化为德国实用主义的艰苦工作表示由衷的赞赏。我在这里做了一些修改，不是在内容上，而是在语言上——部分是为了稍微考虑我的个人措辞；部分是为了把论点本身翻译成德语。语言和社会是相连的；有些语言结构只有在改变形式后才能以准确的方式论证。关于隐喻，用意大利的discorso（用“讨论”来翻译并不完全正确）经常操作。例如，一个意大利的“sede”（可能是一个椅子）就变成了德语的“地方”。对于词汇来说，问题更复杂。人们错误地认为它们具有国际性。即使是数学也无法克服语言障碍。一个解决方案可能是使用英语——但这是一个歪斜的解决方案，因为首先英语在概念上令人沮丧地贫乏；其次，我只是从别人那里知道这一点，因为我自己并不精通英语。 我省略了一些东西：那些不会吸引德国读者兴趣的意大利特色；或者是针对意大利读者关于他可能不了解的情况的特殊通告，例如在解释基本法规定时。 回到正题。这里再次提出的思考需要一些修正、补充、更新——这是一条真理。基本论证保持其有效性。资本的国家，与之相关的政治和经济，已经毫发无损地、即未发生变化地度过了前面提到的崩溃。它们通过了历史的成功考验。然而，这个国家仍然需要被理性的审判台所审查：正如其未发生变化、不可救药、屡犯之罪。而资本现在在世界市场社会中完全不受限制地猖狂，并统治、归纳和摧毁。它仍然如此野蛮，以至于就连那些对现状及爱国主义偶像崇拜的朋友也想要“文明化”它，顺便说一句，“直到无法辨认”——这些是现代经济传教士。 激进的变革，不是向着更好，但向着更人性化，目前看来遥不可及。目前必须留在否定阶段。 鉴于此，我再次提出旧的讨论主题，恳切地推荐给读者的关注。 San Quirico di Moriano，1994年秋 学者身份的确立在困难时期 \\"教学自由并不免除对宪法的忠诚\\"（基本法第5条第3款）。 \\"自由民主基本秩序的基础\\"（联邦宪法法院）。 \\"另一种被命令向人民隐藏的是关于宪法真实性质的信息\\"（伊曼纽尔·康德）。“被命令站在基础上并不免除有义务通报基础的真实性质的责任”（Agnoli）。 前言 学者的定位——众所周知——源自约翰·戈特利布·菲希特；至于时间的贫乏，则是当时霍尔德林所指出的。菲希特的定位基于对新时代开启的信念；而霍尔德林则发现时代相当贫乏，并因此自问，在这样的时代一个诗人应该做些什么。 在我们这个时代，时间的贫乏显得隐蔽而陌生。到处都是无缝的建设。恢复价值。重新发现海外，发现自然及其动植物尊严。虽然断裂在其他地区频繁发生，但这正好证明了我们自己永不停歇的上升浪潮。或者换句话说：一个结束的预兆却是从美国传来的，它宣告（eu-angelion），不同于马克思梦想中的真实历史的开端，它达到了历史的终结性：西方秩序的最终胜利，从积累的祝福到自由民主法治国家的成就。学术世界（即那些不仅仅关心裸露的化学物质或物理量，而是关心人类状况的科学）并没有被排除在外。它们大力促进了秩序结构、价值体系、交流互动的巩固；新国民身份、新内在性与外在性、新功能性的建立。从未像现在这样肯定，建设性工作被视为学者的真正使命：理性被动员起来，一方面是为了系统性地简化总体联系（称为复杂性的减少），另一方面是作为和平交流的缔造者（哲学文本处理的信息技术），另一方面，确切地说，与之开战并从参与中愉快地跳入灵性，跳入心灵的混沌。后者不值一提。更令人担忧的是，新启蒙者们剥夺了理性的历史任务。煽动不服从和简单地摧毁每一种可耻的东西（无论是教会、国家、专制还是其他形式的统治），正如伏尔泰所言。"},{"instruction":"Remove any part that isn\'t about teamwork and that the feeling of achieving something together is better than winning alone. This is the essay: When I look back at my time in high school, leadership wasn’t a role I actively sought out; rather, I found myself in it. It was the last subject pick for our school’s science fair project, chemistry. This was not necessarily out of choice but by default, as every other team had already chosen their subjects and thus, classmates. Even if it wasn’t my first choice, for both subject and members, I wasn’t any less determined to excel. Despite being formed this way, I actually couldn’t ask for more comfortable classmates than us four. My role as what you can call a leader, came about more as a matter of fact than something grand; it was about ensuring we all used our strengths to get the job done right. From the start, I was keen on each of us understanding our capabilities and handling tasks that fit us. This was done not just to be efficient, but to build trust and a sense of shared responsibility, which truly mattered in letting everyone feel valued and needed so we can help each other. Yet, as we progressed, the realization that my delegation skills needed work became apparent. Concerned with meeting our standards within the constraints we faced, I found myself shouldering the majority of the workload. It was challenging to balance my instinct of personal intervention to oversee every detail for reliability against the necessity to trust and open up to my team. While this approach seemed practical to me at first, it soon became clear that despite my preparedness to take on the project almost single-handedly, there were aspects I simply couldn’t handle alone. The realization that collaboration was not just beneficial but necessary was pivotal. More importantly, this journey through the challenges of our project illuminated a fundamental truth about teamwork and leadership for me. The prospect of bringing the project to fruition as a team held a promise far beyond the satisfaction of personal achievement. Yes, I was ready to take on much of the work by myself, but the thought of sharing the journey, the stress, and eventually, the success, was far more appealing. The anticipation of sharing laughter and a sense of accomplishment with my classmates—who I was now proud to call my friends—outweighed the solitary pride of individual achievement. That was why I chose to go through journeys together whenever I can. This project taught me the power of “we” over “I.” While I had initially underestimated this, it became the most rewarding part of our endeavor. The notion of collectively overcoming challenges, experimenting, and eventually succeeding together brought a sense of joy and fulfillment that solo victories could not match. It was a profound lesson in leadership for me: real success was in the shared journey, the mutual struggles, and the collective victory. The sense of accomplishment and the camaraderie that we developed over the course of the project were incomparable. It was about achieving something together that we initially didn’t know was within our reach. This shared success fostered a sense of community and friendship among us that went beyond the confines of the project. It wasn’t just about the science fair anymore; it was about building relationships, learning from each other, and growing together both personally and professionally. In retrospect, my leadership journey through this project was as much about managing the task at hand as it was about understanding the intrinsic value of teamwork and shared success. Recognizing that some tasks were beyond my ability to tackle alone was humbling, and it reiterated the importance of each team member’s contribution. Ultimately, the joy and laughter shared in accomplishing something as a team were the true measures of our success, leaving me with cherished memories and invaluable lessons on leadership and teamwork.","output":"From the start, I was keen on each of us understanding our capabilities and handling tasks that fit us.

It will be explain yourself before the event, explain the event and how it had changed you to be better, and explain present yourself. The personal essay will be about self discipline and it can be called a good habit sooner or later when you do things everyday. Being proactive means that I get more opportunities. I\'d rather regret doing something than regret not doing something. Use examples of real life scenarios to be relatable. Be natural and fit a normal informal tone.","output":"Title: The Discipline Diaries: A Habit of Growth **Before: A Life on Pause** If you’d told me a couple of years ago that discipline would become my middle name, I would’ve laughed it off. Back then, my life was pretty much a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. I was the king of procrastination, the one who’d wait for the eleventh hour to start something or, even worse, just hope it would disappear. My mantra? “It’ll sort itself out.” Spoiler: it never did. My lifestyle wasn’t doing me any favors. My health, both mental and physical, was on a seesaw. One day I’d be climbing mountains, the next, I couldn’t even climb out of bed. My relationships? Let’s not go there. I was stuck in a rut, watching opportunities pass by, always wondering, “What if?” The biggest gut punch was realizing I was more familiar with the feeling of regret than the feeling of achievement. Something had to give. **The Event: Flipping the Script** It wasn’t a lightning bolt epiphany or a grand gesture that kick-started my journey towards self-discipline. No, it was a plant. A small, unassuming, green plant my mom gifted me. She said, “Take care of it, and it’ll grow. Just like you.” It was a responsibility, sure, but it was small. Manageable. What I didn’t expect was how that little plant would mirror my own growth. Caring for it became a daily ritual. Watering it, making sure it got enough sunlight, talking to it (yes, plants love a bit of chit-chat)—it was all on me. That tiny act of discipline, repeated daily, started something. It spread to other areas of my life. I began setting small, achievable goals. “Today, I’ll wake up 30 minutes earlier.” “Tonight, I’ll spend an hour learning something new instead of binging on Netflix.” Slowly, being proactive didn’t feel like a chore. It became my new normal. I found myself embracing opportunities, trying things out of my comfort zone. Yes, there were hits and misses, but the fear of regret from not doing something became my driving force. “I’d rather try and fail than never try at all.” That became my new mantra. **After: A Life in Motion** Today, I’m not just a plant dad. I’m someone who understands the value of self-discipline. It wasn’t just about making my bed every morning or keeping a to-do list. It was about realizing that small, daily habits contribute to larger goals and visions. My health improved because I made better choices. My relationships strengthened because I learned to communicate and commit. Now, I grasp opportunities with both hands. Whether it’s learning a new language, investing in myself professionally, or just experimenting with a new recipe, I’m there. Proactivity has opened doors I didn’t even know existed. The best part? I no longer dwell on the “what ifs.” I live in the “let’s do this.” **Closing Thoughts** My journey taught me an invaluable lesson: discipline is not a punishment. It’s liberation. It frees us from the chains of procrastination, fear, and regret. It’s a testament to the fact that being proactive doesn’t just mean grabbing opportunities; it’s about creating them. Every day, I see the fruits of my discipline, and let me tell you, they\'re much sweeter than the pain of regret. So, to anyone feeling stuck or lost, remember: start small. A tiny habit. A daily ritual. It’s okay to stumble, as long as you get back up. Because, sooner or later, discipline becomes not just a good habit but a way of life. And trust me, it’s a life worth living."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, making a simple, basic pancake is quite cost-effective, and here\'s a straightforward recipe you might consider. This recipe should serve 1-2 people: # Basic Pancake Recipe Ingredients - 1 cup all-purpose flour (cheap and sold in bulk) - 2 tablespoons of sugar (optional, and you can use less to save more) - 1 tablespoon baking powder (to ensure your pancakes are fluffy) - A pinch of salt - 1 cup water or milk (water is the cheaper option, but milk makes the pancake richer) - 1 egg (if eggs are expensive in your area, you could skip this, but it helps with the texture) - 2 tablespoons of oil or melted butter, plus more for the pan (vegetable oil is usually the cheaper option) Instructions 1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar (if using), baking powder, and salt. 2. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and add the water or milk, egg (if using), and oil. Mix until just combined; it\'s okay if there are a few lumps. 3. **Heat Pan**: Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and brush with a little oil. 4. **Cook Pancakes**: Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the pan. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, and the edges look set, about 1-2 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown. 5. **Serve**: Serve hot with your choice of toppings. To keep this within budget, you can use items you might already have, like lemon and sugar, or a little bit of syrup. # Notes: - **Bulk Buying**: Buying ingredients in bulk can help reduce the cost per pancake significantly. - **Toppings**: For a budget-friendly topping, consider seasonal fruits which might be cheaper, or a simple sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon. - **Milk Substitute**: If you can\'t afford milk, using water is perfectly fine and still produces a good pancake. - **Eggs**: While eggs do help with the texture and richness of the pancake, you can exclude them to save on cost, especially if egg prices are high where you are. By adhering to a budget-conscious shopping strategy and utilizing items you may already have in your pantry, you can create a delicious pancake that doesn\'t break the bank.

Это может произойти из-за нескольких причин: 1. **Не CentOS/RHEL 8**: Возможно, ваша система не основана на CentOS/RHEL 8. EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) предназначен для предоставления дополнительных пакетов для RHEL и его клонов (например, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux). Убедитесь, что ваша система соответствует этим требованиям. Вы можете проверить версию вашей системы, выполнив команду: ``` cat /etc/*release ``` Это поможет убедиться, что у вас действительно установлена совместимая версия. 2. **Проблемы с репозиторием**: Если ваша система действительно основана на RHEL 8 или его клоне, проверьте состояние ваших репозиториев DNF. Убедитесь, что базовые репозитории включены и работают корректно. Вы можете просмотреть список всех репозиториев и их состояние командой: ``` dnf repolist ``` Если базовые репозитории отключены, вам необходимо их активировать. 3. **Использование несовместимой версии**: Попытка установить неправильную версию `epel-release` может также привести к такой ошибке. Убедитесь, что вы пытаетесь установить версию EPEL, предназначенную именно для вашей версии CentOS/RHEL. 4. **Проблемы с зависимостями**: В редких случаях может возникнуть конфликт зависимостей из-за несовместимости с уже установленными пакетами. Попробуйте обновить вашу систему, чтобы устранить потенциальные конфликты: ``` dnf update ``` После обновления попробуйте снова установить `epel-release`. Если эти шаги не помогут, рассмотрите возможность добавления репозитория вручную. Для CentOS 8 (или его клонов) вы можете сделать это, создав файл `.repo` в директории `/etc/yum.repos.d/` с нужным содержанием для EPEL."},{"instruction":"Вот такие репозитории у меня: [root@localhost ~]# dnf repolist repo id repo name base RedOS - Base r7-office Repositories for R7 Office updates RedOS - Updates yandex-browser-release Repositories for Yandex Browser","output":"Из вашего списка репозиториев видно, что вы используете не CentOS/RHEL 8, а RedOS, российский дистрибутив Linux, основанный на RPM. Вероятно, из-за этого происходит конфликт при попытке установить пакет `epel-release` для CentOS/RHEL 8, так как `redhat-release`, требуемый пакетом `epel-release`, отсутствует или имеет другую версию в вашей системе. Поскольку EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) предназначен для установки на дистрибутивы Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) и его производные (CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux и другие), его непосредственная установка на RedOS может быть несовместимой без наличия соответствующего `redhat-release` или аналогичного пакета, указывающего на поддержку RHEL. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вам нужно искать специфический репозиторий для RedOS, который предлагает аналогичные пакеты, или исследовать способы адаптации EPEL для работы с RedOS. Вот несколько подходов, которые вы можете рассмотреть: 1. **Поиск аналогов EPEL для RedOS**: Узнайте, существуют ли специфические решения или аналоги репозитория EPEL, предназначенные для использования с RedOS. 2. **Ручная установка пакетов**: Если вы ищете определенные пакеты из EPEL, иногда возможно скачать RPM файлы непосредственно и устанавливать их вручную с помощью `dnf` или `rpm`, учитывая риски. Однако такой подход может создать проблемы с зависимостями. 3. **Создание собственного репозитория**: Вы можете создать собственный репозиторий, собирая нужные пакеты и их зависимости, и настроить его для использования с вашей системой. Это более продвинутое и трудоемкое решение. 4. **Обращение в поддержку или сообщество RedOS**: Возможно, у других пользователей RedOS или у разработчиков альтернативные инструкции или решения, которые могут помочь в вашей ситуации. Ваш случай подчеркивает важность использования репозиториев и пакетов, предназначенных для конкретного дистрибутива, чтобы избежать конфликтов и проблем с зависимостями."},{"instruction":"как в луа работает объявлений функций с двоеточием? откуда берется self?","output":"В Lua объектно-ориентированное программирование реализуется с помощью механизма метатаблиц и механизма \\"двоеточия\\" для работы с методами объектов. Когда мы объявляем функцию с двоеточием в Lua, например, `function MyClass:myMethod()`, это означает, что первым аргументом в функцию будет передаваться специальный параметр `self`, который ссылается на объект, для которого вызывается метод. При вызове метода `myClassInstance:myMethod()`, Lua автоматически подставляет сам объект `myClassInstance` как первый аргумент в функцию `myMethod`. Благодаря этому объекту `self`, метод имеет доступ к полям и методам самого объекта. Таким образом, механизм двоеточия в Lua позволяет удобно работать с методами объектов и делает код более читаемым и компактным."},{"instruction":"разжуй подробнее Когда мы объявляем функцию с двоеточием в Lua, например, function MyClass:myMethod(), это означает, что первым аргументом в функцию будет передаваться специальный параметр self, который ссылается на объект, для которого вызывается метод.","output":"Концепция использования двоеточия и параметра `self` в Lua связана с обработкой объектно-ориентированных возможностей в языке. При объявлении метода с использованием двоеточия, например `function MyClass:myMethod()`, это означает, что функция `myMethod` является методом класса `MyClass`. При вызове этого метода через объект класса `myClassInstance:myMethod()`, сам объект `myClassInstance` будет передан в метод как первый аргумент. Lua не имеет встроенной поддержки классов, но объектно-ориентированное программирование можно реализовать с помощью таблиц и метатаблиц. Когда мы определяем метод класса с двоеточием, Lua автоматически добавляет параметр `self` в список параметров функции и присваивает его значением текущий объект, для которого вызван метод. Например, если у нас есть класс `MyClass` и объект `myClassInstance`, и мы вызываем метод `myMethod` через объект `myClassInstance:myMethod()`, Lua интерпретирует вызов как `MyClass.myMethod(myClassInstance)`. Поэтому внутри метода `myMethod` мы можем обращаться к полям и методам объекта через параметр `self`. Таким образом, концепция двоеточия и параметра `self` в Lua позволяет легко работать с объектами и методами объектов, обеспечивает более удобный и читаемый код при использовании объектно-ориентированных подходов в языке Lua."},{"instruction":"объясни этот код: local Obj = { var = 0, } function Obj:new(val) self:set(val or 0) return self end function Obj:set(val) self.var = val end function Obj:print() print(self.var) end local a = Obj:new(42) a:print() local b = Obj:new(100500) b:print() a:print() -- 42 -- 100500 -- 100500","output":"В этом коде определяется таблица `Obj`, которая является прототипом для создания объектов. В таблице `Obj` есть поле `var`, функция `new`, функция `set` и функция `print`. Функция `new` создает новый объект на основе таблицы `Obj` и присваивает ему начальное значение переменной `var`, используя функцию `set`. Важно отметить, что при объявлении метода `new`, используется двоеточие, что означает, что первым аргументом в функцию будет передаваться объект-инстанс. Функция `set` устанавливает значение переменной `var` в объекте на заданное значение. Функция `print` выводит на экран значение переменной `var` объекта. Далее, создаются два объекта `a` и `b` с помощью вызовов `Obj:new(42)` и `Obj:new(100500)`. Затем, выводится значение переменной `var` для объектов `a` и `b` с помощью вызова метода `print`. Обратите внимание, что при вызове `a:print()` Lua автоматически передает объект `a` в функцию `print` как параметр `self`, что позволяет методу `print` обращаться к полю `var` объекта `a`. Результат работы данного кода будет: ``` 42 100500 100500 ```"},{"instruction":"почему происходит переиспользование одной и той таблицы","output":"При создании объектов `a` и `b` на основе таблицы `Obj` с помощью функции `Obj:new()`, происходит однократное создание нового объекта, который ссылается на одну и ту же таблицу `Obj`. В методе `new` происходит инициализация переменной `var` в создаваемом объекте, устанавливая ее в переданное значение (или по умолчанию в 0). При этом метод `new` возвращает созданный объект, но не создает новую таблицу-прототип для него, а все методы и поля объекта будут ссылаться на таблицу `Obj`. В итоге, при вызове методов `set` и `print` для объектов `a` и `b`, эти методы действуют с переменной `var`, которая является общей для всех объектов, созданных на базе таблицы `Obj`. Поэтому при вызове метода `print` для объектов `a` и `b`, мы получаем соответствующие значения переменной `var`, установленные при создании объектов.

This forest represents your world, your everyday life filled with routines and expectations. However, hidden within this forest are unseen traps, pits covered with leaves and twigs, not visible at first glance. These traps are like the triggers of panic disorder, unexpected and concealed, waiting for an unwary step. One day, as you\'re walking, you fall into one of these hidden pits, and it happens so suddenly that you\'re overwhelmed with fear. Your heart races, breath quickens, and every sense comes alive with a dreadful anticipation of unknown dangers lurking in the shadows. This terrifying experience is akin to a panic attack, an intense surge of fear that manifests physically within minutes, often without any obvious cause. Despite being rescued from the pit, the memory of the fall haunts you. Now, each step through the forest is filled with anxiety. The once familiar and safe path now seems fraught with hidden dangers. You start to avoid certain areas, perhaps even the forest altogether, altering your life to evade the traps. This change in your behavior reflects the persistent worry about when the next panic attack might strike and the strategies developed to prevent future falls—characteristic of living with panic disorder. In essence, panic disorder, through the lens of this metaphor, illustrates how an unforeseen, intense, and terrifying event can transform a once secure environment into a landscape of potential threats. It emphasizes the suddenness of panic attacks and the profound impact they have on a person\'s behavior, well-being, and quality of life, all set within the previously tranquil forest of daily existence."},{"instruction":"FOR the panic disorder metaphor, what are some Exercises and Reflections to Provide readers with guided exercises or reflective questions associated with each metaphor can help them personalize insights and apply them to their own experiences. These activities might include journal prompts, mindfulness exercises, or creative expression tasks such as drawing or writing.","output":"# Exercises and Reflections for the Panic Disorder Forest Metaphor 1. **Journal Prompts** - **Identify Your Forest**: Reflect on the aspects of your life that feel like the \'forest\'— safe, familiar, and comfortable. How has panic disorder introduced \'hidden pits\' into this forest for you? - **Map Your Traps**: Draw a map of your forest, marking where you\'ve encountered traps (panic attacks). Include paths you now avoid and safe spaces you retreat to. Reflect on how this has changed your journey through the forest. - **Escape Plan**: Write about a time you fell into a trap but found your way out. What helped you? Did someone or something act as a guide rope? How can you integrate that strategy into facing future traps? 2. **Mindfulness Exercise** - **Mindful Walking in Your Forest**: In a real forest or green space, practice mindful walking. With each step, ground yourself in the present moment. Acknowledge any fear of \'traps\' but remind yourself of the solid ground beneath you. Reflect on this experience and how you might apply mindfulness to navigate the forest of daily life without fear of the hidden pits. 3. **Creative Expression Tasks** - **Draw Your Forest**: Create a visual representation of your forest with its traps, paths, and safe spaces. Use colors, shapes, and symbols to represent emotions, challenges, and victories. Reflect on your artwork and what it reveals about your journey with panic disorder. - **Writing Your Way Through the Woods**: Write a short story or poem from the perspective of a character navigating the forest, facing and overcoming traps. Use this creative process to explore your feelings about panic disorder and the strategies that help you cope. 4. **Reflection on Pathways** - **Navigating the Path Less Traveled**: Reflect on alternative paths you\'ve taken to avoid the pits. How have these changed your journey through the forest? Have any of these paths led to unexpected discoveries or new strengths? - **Constructing Bridges**: Imagine building bridges over your forest\'s traps. What materials (skills, support systems, knowledge) would you need? Reflect on how you can gather these materials in your life. 5. **Gratitude and Growth** - **Gratefulness in the Grove**: Even in the densest forests with the deepest pits, there are spots of beauty and serenity. Write a gratitude list for moments of peace and personal growth you\'ve experienced despite (or because of) the challenges of panic disorder. - **Seeding New Growth**: Consider what seeds you want to plant in your forest for the future. These could be seeds of courage, new coping mechanisms, or self-compassion. Reflect on how you\'ll nurture these seeds to grow strong trees that can provide shelter from future storms. By engaging with these exercises and reflections, readers can gain deeper personal insights into their experiences with panic disorder, using the metaphor of the forest and its traps as a guide for exploration and growth."},{"instruction":"name the panic disorder metaphor","output":"\\"Journey Through the Hidden Forest: Navigating the Landscape of Panic Disorder\\""},{"instruction":"metaphor for panic","output":"Imagine panic as a sudden, intense storm on the open sea. Your mind is a ship navigating through the vast waters of daily life—usually calm, with a clear direction. Out of nowhere, this tempest of panic strikes, overwhelming your senses. Waves of fear crash against the hull, winds of anxiety howl, disorienting you, and for a moment, you lose sight of the horizon. The storm turns the once manageable task of steering through life\'s waters into a formidable challenge, testing your ship\'s resilience and your ability to navigate through unseen, unpredictable turmoil. In this metaphor, the ship represents your inner strength and resources, while the tools and strategies you\'ve gathered—such as mindfulness, breathing techniques, and support systems—act as navigational instruments helping to guide your ship back to calm waters. This visualization of panic highlights both the startling surprise of an attack and the potential to weather the storm with preparation and support, eventually returning to a state of peace and direction."},{"instruction":"Elaborate more on this metaphor, further teaching a valuable message","output":"Expanding upon the metaphor of panic as a storm on the open sea, let\'s delve deeper into the layers of meaning and the valuable lessons it can teach us. **The Sea as the Mind’s Landscape**: The open sea, vast and unpredictable, mirrors the expansive nature of our minds. Just as the sea can be calm and serene or wild and tumultuous, so too can our mental and emotional states fluctuate. This ever-changing seascape teaches us that while we may not control the sea itself, we can learn to navigate its conditions. **The Ship as Our Core Self**: Our personal ship, built from the hull of resilience, courage, and hope, represents our core self and our capacity to endure challenges. Over time, we reinforce our ship with experiences and learnings, making it sturdier against future storms. This emphasizes the importance of personal development and self-care, fortifying our inner selves to be resilient in the face of sudden panic. **Navigational Tools as Coping Strategies**: Just as a skilled sailor relies on navigational tools to chart a course through challenging waters, we too must equip ourselves with coping strategies and support systems to navigate the storms of panic. Mindfulness practices act as our compass, helping us to stay present and find our center. Breathing techniques are our anchor, grounding us amidst overwhelming emotions. The support of loved ones and professionals serves as our lighthouse, guiding us back to safety when we feel lost at sea. **The Storm as a Teacher**: While the storm of panic may appear as a formidable foe, it also carries valuable lessons. Each storm we weather teaches us more about our strengths and vulnerabilities, providing insights into how to better prepare for future challenges. It reminds us to practice flexibility, adaptability, and to respect the power of our emotions — akin to the sailor’s respect for the sea’s might. **The Calm After the Storm**: Perhaps the most profound lesson lies in the calm that follows the storm. The sea becomes still once more, the sun breaks through the clouds, and in this moment of tranquility, we realize our own capacity to endure and overcome. The post-storm calm reassures us that peace is always possible, no matter the intensity of the tempest. It\'s a reminder that, despite the unpredictability of our emotional seas, tranquility returns, offering moments for reflection, recovery, and appreciation of our journey’s beauty and our strength in navigating it. In this expanded metaphor, panic as a storm on the open sea teaches us not just about the nature of panic, but about resilience, preparation, the importance of support, and the inherent capability within us to navigate through life’s most challenging tempests. It underscores a message of hope and empowerment, reminding us that we are equipped to sail through and emerge stronger, with newfound insights and a deeper appreciation for the calm waters in our lives."},{"instruction":"name that metaphor for panic","output":"\\"Storms of the Mind: Navigating the Seas of Panic\\""},{"instruction":"“Storms of the Mind: Navigating the Seas of Panic”, what are some Exercises and Reflections to Provide readers with guided exercises or reflective questions associated with each metaphor can help them personalize insights and apply them to their own experiences.

Normally, this valley is serene and peaceful, a landscape within yourself where thoughts and emotions gently meander like a tranquil river. The sky above is clear, reflecting your ability to see life with clarity and purpose. This valley represents the harmony and balance of your internal world. Without warning, dark clouds gather, eclipsing the tranquil blues and soft hues of your mental skyline. A storm of panic brews on the horizon, rolling in faster than you can prepare. Lightning cracks, illuminating the sky with intense flashes of fear, while thunder echoes, amplifying anxieties and shaking the ground of your once stable valley. The river that runs through your valley swells, driven by the downpour of overwhelming thoughts, threatening to flood the banks of your composure. In this metaphor, the lightning represents the sudden, sharp onset of panic—an electrical jolt of fear that lights up your entire mental landscape. The thunder is the resounding impact of that fear, echoing through your consciousness, shaking your sense of security. The river, once peaceful, now becomes a metaphor for your mind’s racing thoughts and emotions, swelling beyond its limits, challenging your ability to maintain control. **Coping with the Storm**: As the storm rages, you seek shelter—a safe space within yourself. This shelter could be a cave of resilience you\'ve carved over years, a sturdy cabin built from the materials of coping strategies you’ve learned, or a protective canopy of supportive relationships. From this place of refuge, you remind yourself that storms, no matter how fierce, are temporary. You focus on your breathing, each inhale and exhale a mantra of calm, helping to steady the swells of your racing thoughts. **After the Storm**: Gradually, the storm subsides. The clouds disperse, revealing once again the clear sky of your mind. The river of your thoughts returns to its gentle flow. In the aftermath, the valley of your mind is more fertile than before, nourished by the rain of understanding and compassion for yourself. You realize that each storm faced builds your resilience, deepening the roots of your inner strength and expanding the capacity of your personal growth. Through this, you learn that while you cannot control when the storms of panic arrive, you possess the inner resources to weather them, and each time, these storms carve deeper channels of resilience and understanding within the valley of your mind."},{"instruction":"name that metaphor","output":"\\"The Valley of Mind: Weathering the Storms of Panic\\""},{"instruction":"Another panic metaphor with a name","output":"Imagine panic as a sudden, powerful earthquake shaking the foundation of a once stable city, your inner world. This city, a bustling metropolis of thoughts, emotions, and memories, operates in harmony, its inhabitants living their lives with a sense of predictable routine. The buildings, grand and secure, represent your beliefs, your values, and your sense of self—constructed over years with care and precision. Without warning, the ground trembles. Panic strikes like an unseen fault line shifting beneath the city, sending shockwaves through its streets. Buildings sway and windows shatter, mirroring the fracturing of your tranquility. The once straight pathways become obstructed with debris, symbolizing the obstacles to clear thinking that panic brings. The city\'s inhabitants, representing different facets of your psyche, are thrown into chaos, running in different directions, seeking safety. **Navigating the Aftermath**: In the wake of the quake, amidst the swirling dust and uncertainty, you find yourself at the epicenter, tasked with restoring order. The initial shock gives way to a determination to rebuild, stronger and more resilient than before. You clear the pathways, piece by piece, representing the step-by-step process of calming your mind and regaining control over your thoughts. **Reconstruction and Reinforcement**: With time, the city begins to heal. Cracks in the foundation are filled with stronger materials, just as you fortify your psyche with new coping mechanisms and insights gleaned from surviving the quake. Buildings are reinforced, designed to withstand future tremors, symbolizing the adaptive strategies and safeguards you\'ve implemented in your life to manage panic more effectively. **Preparedness and Growth**: The newly rebuilt city is more beautiful and robust than its predecessor, its landscapes enriched with gardens of self-compassion and streets lined with the wisdom of experience. The inhabitants return, moving with greater purpose and solidarity, embodying the strengthened aspects of your character. And while the memory of the quake lingers, it serves as a reminder of both vulnerability and immense strength, of the capacity to recover and flourish despite the unpredictable quakes of panic. This metaphor illustrates that panic, like an earthquake, can shake the very foundations of our being, disrupting our inner world without warning.

This metropolis, vibrant and lively, represents the constant activity within your thoughts, emotions, and memories, all illuminating your inner world like countless buildings in a cityscape at night. Each light in the windows represents different facets of your being—hopes, dreams, fears, and ideas, all glowing with the energy of your consciousness. Without warning, panic sweeps through like a massive power outage, plunging the city into darkness. The familiar becomes unfamiliar, the visible turns invisible, and the once navigable streets of your thoughts are now obscured by shadows of doubt and confusion. The blackout, sudden and enveloping, represents the overwhelming feeling of losing control that accompanies panic, where clarity and confidence are replaced by uncertainty and fear. **Finding Your Way in the Dark**: Despite the initial shock and disorientation, you recall that you\'ve navigated these streets countless times before. You remind yourself that the city—your inner self—remains, even if temporarily hidden from view. Guided by the faint glow of emergency lights (your inner resilience and coping strategies), you begin to find your way, step by cautious step. **The Glow of Connection**: You reach out, metaphorically, to others who can help guide you. This connection with friends, family, or a therapist acts like the city\'s emergency response team, providing additional light sources and guidance to help you navigate the uncertainty. Together, you work to restore power, one section of the city at a time. **Reillumination**: As power returns, the cityscape of your mind gradually lights up again. Each building, each light within, comes back to life, casting away shadows and illuminating paths that seemed impassable in the dark. With the city fully lit, the panic-induced blackout feels like a distant memory, but the experience leaves you better prepared. You\'ve gained knowledge about where the emergency generators are located and how to activate them more quickly in the future. **Preparedness and Insight**: Armed with this new understanding, you enhance the city\'s infrastructure, installing more reliable backup power systems and ensuring that emergency lights are more accessible, symbolizing the development of stronger coping mechanisms and a support network for times of crisis. This metaphor illustrates panic as an unexpected challenge that tests our ability to navigate through the darkest moments. But it also emphasizes resilience, the importance of connection, and the power of personal growth, reminding us that even in the darkest times, we possess the ability to find light and emerge stronger. **Metaphor Title**: \\"The City in the Dark: Illuminating the Path Through Panic\\""},{"instruction":"The City in the Dark: Illuminating the Path Through Panic” what are some Exercises and Reflections to Provide readers with guided exercises or reflective questions associated with each metaphor can help them personalize insights and apply them to their own experiences.

Their roles, pivotal in managing and rehabilitating inmates while ensuring security, expose them to various psychological, physical, and occupational hazards. Here are some common challenges they face: # 1. Psychological Stress and Burnout - **High-Stress Environment**: Correctional facilities are high-stress environments where workers must constantly be vigilant, managing inmates with varied and complex needs, including aggressive or violent behaviors. - **Exposure to Violence and Trauma**: Regular exposure to violent incidents, self-harm, and the overall punitive atmosphere of correctional settings can lead to secondary traumatic stress. - **Burnout**: The cumulative effect of stress, long hours, and the emotionally taxing nature of the work often leads to burnout, characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and a feeling of reduced personal accomplishment. # 2. Physical Health Risks - **Injury**: Correctional officers face a higher risk of physical injury from confrontations with inmates, including being assaulted or involved in physical altercations. - **Exposure to Illness**: Working in close quarters with a large inmate population can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases. # 3. Mental Health Concerns - **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Correctional workers may develop PTSD from witnessing violence, threats, or other traumatic events within the facility. - **Depression and Anxiety**: The challenging and often negative work environment can contribute to higher levels of depression and anxiety among correctional staff. # 4. Occupational Hazards - **Staff Shortages**: Many correctional facilities operate with insufficient staff, putting additional pressure on existing workers through mandatory overtime and increasing the stress of the job. - **Lack of Adequate Training**: While this varies by location, some correctional workers may receive minimal training for dealing with the complex psychological and behavioral challenges of inmates, leading to feelings of inadequacy and increased risk of conflict. # 5. Ethical and Moral Challenges - **Moral Dilemmas**: Workers may face moral dilemmas when the well-being of inmates clashes with institutional policies or when they witness inhumane treatment. - **Compassion Fatigue**: Constant exposure to inmates\' suffering, combined with the demand to maintain professional detachment, can lead to compassion fatigue. # 6. Social Isolation - **Stigma**: The stigma associated with working in corrections can affect staff\'s personal lives, leading to social isolation or difficulties in discussing work-related stress with family and friends. # 7. Work-Life Balance - **Irregular Hours and Mandatory Overtime**: The demands of shift work, long hours, and unpredictable crises can disrupt personal life and negatively impact work-life balance. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including comprehensive training, support systems for mental health, improving staff-inmate ratios, and creating a culture that promotes safety, respect, and rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"Use a metaphor to explain this: # 1.

This terrain, while inherently majestic and commanding respect, demands constant vigilance from those who traverse its paths. The environment is harsh and unpredictable, with the ground beneath their feet constantly shifting due to the unstable nature of the terrain, mirroring the high-stress environment of correctional facilities. Each day, workers set out to navigate this landscape, facing steep climbs and sudden drops, akin to managing inmates with complex and aggressive behaviors. As they trek deeper into this mountainous region, they are frequently caught in unforeseen storms—these represent the violent incidents and overall punitive atmosphere they are exposed to. Each storm leaves the landscape a bit more eroded, a bit more difficult to navigate the next time. Over time, these relentless storms contribute to the secondary traumatic stress experienced by the workers, wearing down even the most resilient among them. Eventually, the cumulative effect of these conditions—constantly being on alert, the exposure to violence and trauma, and the relentlessness of the environment—leads to a state of burnout. This can be imagined as reaching a point on their journey where the path forward is obscured, their provisions are depleted, and they find themselves unable to appreciate the rugged beauty of the mountains they once found fulfilling. Exhaustion overtakes them, not just physically but emotionally and mentally. Cynicism clouds their view like a thick fog, and the sense of accomplishment that once propelled them forward is now a distant memory, overshadowed by the daunting, never-ending path that lies ahead. This burnout doesn’t just signal a moment of weakness; rather, it’s a sign that the journey has become unsustainable without significant changes—such as new strategies for navigating the terrain, better equipment to weather the storms, and more frequent periods of rest and recovery to restore their strength and reignite their passion for the climb."},{"instruction":"name that metaphor","output":"\\"Mountains of Vigilance: Navigating the Rugged Terrain of Correctional Work\\""},{"instruction":"what are some Exercises and Reflections to Provide readers with guided exercises or reflective questions associated with each metaphor can help them personalize insights and apply them to their own experiences.

Describe the mountains you\'re navigating in your work. What parts of the journey have been the most challenging? What have been the most rewarding vistas (moments of success or fulfillment)? - **Storms Weathered**: Think about recent \\"storms\\" you\'ve faced (challenging situations involving stress or exposure to violence). How did you feel during these storms? What strategies did you use to get through them? How did these experiences change the landscape of your mountain? - **Supplies for the Journey**: Consider what supplies (resources, coping mechanisms, supports) you currently carry in your backpack. Which supplies have been the most useful? Are there any new tools or supplies you need to make your journey more manageable? 2. **Mindfulness Exercises** - **Mountain Breathing Meditation**: Close your eyes and visualize yourself sitting at a peaceful spot on your mountain. With each inhale, breathe in the strength and stability of the mountain; with each exhale, release any tension or stress you\'re carrying. Spend a few moments enjoying the view from your inner mountain, acknowledging the journey you\'ve undertaken so far. - **Grounding With Nature**: Spend time in a natural setting, if possible. As you walk or sit, focus on the physical sensations around you—the ground beneath you, the air on your skin, the sounds of nature. Use this time to ground yourself, drawing parallels between the calm of nature and finding moments of peace in your own journey. 3. **Creative Expression Tasks** - **Drawing Your Terrain**: Use drawing, painting, or digital art to depict the terrain you\'re navigating. Visualize the mountains, the paths you\'ve taken, and the storms you\'ve weathered.

This explorer can be you, a fictional character, or even an abstract representation of your experiences. Express the challenges, the beauty, and the lessons learned along the way. 4. **Reflection on Resilience and Growth** - **Identifying Your Base Camps**: Reflect on safe havens or \\"base camps\\" along your journey—times when you\'ve felt supported, understood, or particularly resilient. What made these moments or places safe? How can you seek out or create more of these base camps in your current environment? - **Looking at the Summit**: Imagine yourself reaching a summit on your mountain—achieving a meaningful goal or overcoming a significant challenge. What does this summit look like? How do you feel as you stand there? What can you see from this vantage point that you couldn\'t see before? 5. **Planning for Future Ascents** - **Preparing for the Next Climb**: Based on what you\'ve learned so far on your journey, plan for future climbs. What will you do differently? What supplies will you need to gather? How will you build resilience for future storms? These exercises are designed to help correctional workers and others in high-stress environments reflect on their experiences, identify coping strategies, and celebrate their resilience and growth. By engaging deeply with the metaphor of navigating rugged mountains, individuals can gain new insights into their professional and personal journeys."},{"instruction":"Another metaphor for correctional officer","output":"Imagine the role of a correctional officer as the task of a lighthouse keeper on a treacherous coastline. This coastline, constantly battered by fierce waves and unpredictable storms, represents the turbulent and often hazardous environment of a correctional facility. The lighthouse itself, strong and steadfast, stands as a beacon of order and safety amidst the chaos, mirroring the officer\'s role in maintaining control and offering guidance within the walls of the institution. **The Keeper\'s Duties**: Just as a lighthouse keeper ensures the lighthouse\'s light burns bright to guide ships safely through dangerous waters, a correctional officer navigates the complexities of managing inmate populations, preventing conflicts, and dealing with emergencies. The keeper must be vigilant, always prepared for the unexpected storm or the fog that rolls in without warning, much like officers must be ready to act in tense situations or crises. **Braving the Storms**: Often, the keeper faces fierce storms that test the limits of their endurance and the lighthouse\'s resilience. These storms can be seen as the physical confrontations, emotional tolls, and ethical dilemmas correctional officers confront, challenging their strength and often leaving them feeling isolated in their watch. **The Solitude of the Tower**: The lighthouse keeper\'s role is inherently solitary, spending long hours watching over the sea. Similarly, correctional officers may feel isolated due to the nature of their work, the stigma attached to their profession, or the burden of what they witness on the job, contributing to the sensation of being alone even in a facility full of people. **Illuminating the Dark**: Despite the challenges, the lighthouse keeper plays a crucial role in illuminating the path for others, helping them navigate through their darkest nights and avoid the rocks that could spell disaster. In parallel, correctional officers provide structure, enforce rules, and sometimes offer a guiding light to those within the facility, helping inmates find their way through difficult periods of their lives. **Maintenance and Care**: Just as the lighthouse keeper must maintain the lighthouse, ensuring its light never falters, officers must also take care of their well-being, staying mentally and physically prepared for the demands of their job. This includes seeking support, engaging in self-care, and finding ways to recharge away from the turbulent shores they patrol. This metaphor not only highlights the challenges faced by those who work within correctional facilities but also emphasizes the importance of their role in guiding, protecting, and enduring through the storms. It\'s a reminder of the strength, resilience, and sometimes overlooked humanity of those who keep the lighthouse shining. **Metaphor Title**: \\"The Lighthouse Keeper: Guiding Through Turbulent Seas\\""},{"instruction":"paraphrase: 9:40pm-Youth’s mother called and stated she received a call from youth’s friend that youth passed out at a concert and was on her way to Mass general hospital via ambulance.

The incident, captured in a video that has since gone viral, showcases the petrifying moments leading up to the animal\'s euthanasia, igniting a conversation about ethical treatment and veterinary practices. The rabbit, named Oliver by its owners, was taken to a local veterinary clinic after displaying signs of illness. Following an examination, the decision was made to put Oliver down, a moment met with acute fear from the animal, as evident in the distressing audio captured in the video. The family, unaware of the potential for such a reaction, is devastated and seeking answers. The video, shared across Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, has amassed millions of views, with users expressing their horror and sadness at the situation. A significant portion of the conversation hinges on the crucial detail provided by the family later — that a second opinion they sought posthumously suggested Oliver may have been misdiagnosed, raising serious questions about the decision to euthanize. “This is heartbreaking. That rabbit was terrified, and now to hear there might have been a misdiagnosis? It\'s just unacceptable. Vets need to be held to higher standards,” tweeted one user, echoing the sentiment of thousands of others calling for a reevaluation of veterinary practices and euthanasia procedures. Animal welfare organizations have weighed in, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive diagnostics and advocating for the rights of pets to receive accurate and empathetic medical care. “Animals are sentient beings that deserve every chance at life.

It\'s clear that there is a dire need for better communication, compassion, and transparency in these critical moments.\\" In response to Oliver\'s case, animal welfare organizations and thousands of social media users have rallied for changes in how animals are diagnosed and the criteria for euthanasia. An online petition has collected thousands of signatures, calling for an investigation into the incident and urging the implementation of stricter diagnostic protocols before making irreversible decisions. \\"We don\'t want any other family to endure the pain we\'re going through. We are speaking out in the hope that Oliver\'s story will incite change, ensuring that animals receive the most careful and compassionate care possible,\\" Oliver\'s owner concluded. The veterinary clinic involved has yet to respond publicly to the allegations and the mounting demand for change. However, with the public outcry showing no signs of abating, it is clear that Oliver\'s story could be the catalyst for a reevaluation of veterinary practices, aiming to safeguard the welfare and dignity of pets into the future. As the conversation continues, it\'s evident that Oliver\'s legacy may bring about positive change, preventing future incidents of this nature and fostering a more compassionate, ethical approach to animal care in the veterinary profession."},{"instruction":"在# 将 4输入分开，构建新的相同模态结合的2输入，2分支 import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE_S(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : `An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale` -

The exception message `\\"TypeError: \'int\' object is not subscriptable\\"` suggests that somewhere in your code you are trying to treat an integer as if it were a subscriptable object (like a list or a dictionary), which is not possible. From the provided code snippet, it seems the issue is with the line: ```python mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=1. / self.patch_size).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` (and similarly for `mask_z`) Here, `self.patch_size` is expected to be a subscriptable object (a tuple or list), but it is actually an integer as defined in the constructor of the class `VisionTransformerCE_S`. The immediate fix is to ensure that you\'re treating `self.patch_size` correctly. Since you seem to expect `patch_size` to be a tuple at some points in your code, adjusting its definition to be a tuple might resolve the issue, assuming it does not cause conflicts elsewhere in your code. If `patch_size` needs to remain as an integer but you require it to behave as a tuple for operations like `F.interpolate`, you can adjust the relevant operation as follows: Change: ```python mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=1. / self.patch_size).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` To: ```python scale_factor = 1. / self.patch_size if isinstance(self.patch_size, int) else 1. / max(self.patch_size) mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=scale_factor).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` And similarly for `mask_z`. This adjustment first checks if `self.patch_size` is an integer and directly uses it, or if it\'s a tuple, it takes the max value from it to use as `scale_factor`. This solution assumes that when `patch_size` is a tuple, its elements represent dimensions that can be normalized by taking their maximum when calculating the scale factor, which might not be ideal for all cases but provides a generalized approach. Ensure to review your use of `patch_size` across your code to maintain consistency and avoid similar issues, particularly checking if it being an integer or tuple affects any other operations."},{"instruction":"中文回答","output":"您遇到的错误与在`forward_features`方法中处理`patch_size`的方式有关，具体是在对`mask_x`和`mask_z`进行插值操作时遇到的问题。异常消息`\\"TypeError: \'int\' object is not subscriptable\\"`表明在您的代码中，您尝试将一个整数当作可下标订阅的对象（如列表或字典）来处理，这是不可能的。 从提供的代码片段来看，问题出在以下这行代码上： ```python mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=1. / self.patch_size).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` （以及对`mask_z`的类似处理） 这里，`self.patch_size`预期是一个可订阅的对象（元组或列表），但实际上它是一个整数，如在类`VisionTransformerCE_S`的构造函数中定义的那样。 立即修复的方法是确保您正确处理`self.patch_size`。由于您在代码的某些地方期望`patch_size`是一个元组，调整它的定义为元组可能会解决这个问题，假设它不会在代码的其他地方引起冲突。如果`patch_size`需要保持为一个整数，但您需要它在像`F.interpolate`这样的操作中表现为元组，您可以按以下方式调整相关操作： 将： ```python mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=1. / self.patch_size).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` 改为： ```python scale_factor = 1. / self.patch_size if isinstance(self.patch_size, int) else 1. / max(self.patch_size) mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=scale_factor).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` 对`mask_z`也作相应更改。 这个调整首先检查`self.patch_size`是否为整数并直接使用它，如果它是一个元组，就从中取最大值作为`scale_factor`。这个解决方案假设当`patch_size`是一个元组时，它的元素代表的维度可以通过取最大值来标准化，以计算缩放因子，这对所有情况可能并不理想，但它提供了一种通用方法。 确保审查代码中对`patch_size`的使用，以保持一致性并避免类似问题，特别是检查它作为整数或元组是否影响任何其他操作。"},{"instruction":"在import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : `An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale` -

通过打印或调试检查`F.interpolate`之前`mask_x`和`self.patch_size`的值，以确认是否如预期那样正确。这能帮助定位问题的准确位置。 总的来说，对于这个特定的错误和相关代码段，你可能需要重新评估和检查`mask_x`的处理策略，以确保插值操作能够按预期执行。而对于`combine_tokens`函数，除非它与`mask_x`处理逻辑直接相关，否则可能不是直接影响错误的地方。"},{"instruction":"mask_z是正确的","output":"如果您已经确认`mask_z`是正确的，而问题出现在处理`mask_x`时涉及到的`F.interpolate`操作，这表明我们应将注意力集中在如何正确使用`F.interpolate`以及确保所有相关参数都是预期的形式。 从错误`TypeError: \'int\' object is not subscriptable`来看，问题不太可能直接与`mask_z`或`mask_x`的内容有关，因为`mask_z`被确认为正确，那么处理方式应该也是适当的。问题更有可能和代码试图执行一个不适当的操作，如在一个整数上使用切片或下标访问，这通常是由代码其他部分的逻辑错误导致的。 既然`mask_z`处理逻辑被确认无误，让我们专注于`mask_x`在`F.interpolate`中的使用。根据您的描述，问题集中在这行代码： ```python mask_x = F.interpolate(mask_x[None].float(), scale_factor=1. / self.patch_size).to(torch.bool)[0] ``` # 分析和建议 1. **确认`self.patch_size`的用法**：先确保`self.patch_size`是一个合法的、用于`F.interpolate`中`scale_factor`的整数或浮点数。由于这一行代码本身对`self.patch_size`没有执行下标操作，如果`self.patch_size`确实是一个整数，那么问题不在这里。 2. **审查`mask_x`的维度和形状**：在`F.interpolate`之前，确保`mask_x`的形状和维度是预期中的。这里通过`mask_x[None].float()`添加了一个新的维度，以适应`F.interpolate`的要求。使用打印语句或调试器来确认`mask_x`在这一操作前后的确切形状。 3. **错误定位**：尽管错误信息指向了`self.patch_size`不可下标访问，但实际的问题可能与之间接相关或在不同的地方。有可能是因为尝试在不支持下标访问的对象上执行了下标访问。由于确认`mask_z`处理无误，那么可能的问题点在于对`self.patch_size`的错误引用或理解错误。检查所有对`self.patch_size`引用的地方，确保没有误用。 4. **检查环境和库版本**：不同版本的PyTorch可能在处理特定操作时表现不同。确认您使用的PyTorch版本与代码预期的兼容。 5. **简化问题复现步骤**：尝试将涉及问题的代码片段简化并独立运行。比如，只运行和`mask_x`、`mask_z`处理有关的代码部分，看是否能复现问题。这有助于隔离问题，确保没有其他代码逻辑干扰错误诊断。 如果经过上述分析和尝试后问题仍未解决，您可以考虑提供更多的上下文信息，比如`mask_x`的初始化和处理过程，以及`self.patch_size`的赋值和使用逻辑。这有助于更精确地诊断问题所在。"},{"instruction":"对比：import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : `An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale` -

第一个版本的类被命名为`VisionTransformerCE`。 - 第二个版本的类被命名为`VisionTransformerCE_S`。这可能表明第二个版本是对第一个版本的一个特定修改或简化版（尽管从代码来看并不简化），`_S`可能代表了一个特殊的版本或针对某个特定场景的优化。 2. **输出修改**： - 在`forward_features`方法的最后，第一个版本返回一个元组包含`x`和一些附加信息`aux_dict`。 - 第二个版本则返回`x, attn, event_attn`，这表明第二个版本增加了对attention权重的返回，可能是为了后期的分析或其他用途。`event_attn`只在第二个版本中出现，表示为`event_x`和`event_z`输入计算得到的attention权重。 3. **分支处理的差异**： - 第二个版本似乎更明确地区分了两个处理流程或分支。开始是常规的`x`和`z`输入处理，紧接着是处理事件相关的输入`event_x`和`event_z`，最后把这两个处理结果合并。这使得第二个版本在处理不同模态（如标准图像和事件相关数据）时更为明确和直观。 4. **事件相关位置嵌入**： - 两个版本都引入了`pos_embed_event`，用于处理事件相关的输入。但在实际使用场景和具体实现上，第二个版本似乎更强调对这类数据的处理，特别是在`forward_features`方法中明确对`event_x`和`event_z`进行了位置嵌入的加和操作。 5. **print语句**： - 第二个版本中加入了多个`print`语句用于输出`x`和`event_x`的形状，这可能是开发者为了调试而加入的临时代码，用来监视数据在不同处理阶段的形状变化。 6. **函数定义**： - 在您提供的代码片段中，并没有提到`combine_tokens`函数如何修改。考虑到您对如何修改`combine_tokens`函数的询问，看起来第二版本的主要改动并不涉及到这个函数的定义变化。`combine_tokens`函数主要用于合并不同的token，而具体的使用和行为可能取决于它在各版本中被调用和应用的上下文。 综上所述，这两个版本在设计上存在一定的一致性，但第二个版本`VisionTransformerCE_S`引入了额外的attention权重输出以及对事件输入的更明确处理。这些变化可能是为了满足某些特定的研究或应用需求，如对attention机制的深入分析，或更有效地处理混合模态数据。"},{"instruction":"目前第一个版本中的def combine_tokens(template_tokens, search_tokens, event_z, event_x, mode=\'direct\', return_res=False): # [B, HW, C] len_t = template_tokens.shape[1] len_s = search_tokens.shape[1] if mode == \'direct\': merged_feature = torch.cat((template_tokens, search_tokens, event_z, event_x), dim=1) elif mode == \'template_central\': central_pivot = len_s // 2 first_half = search_tokens[:, :central_pivot, :] second_half = search_tokens[:, central_pivot:, :] merged_feature = torch.cat((first_half, template_tokens, second_half), dim=1) elif mode == \'partition\': feat_size_s = int(math.sqrt(len_s)) feat_size_t = int(math.sqrt(len_t)) window_size = math.ceil(feat_size_t / 2.) # pad feature maps to multiples of window size B, _, C = template_tokens.shape H = W = feat_size_t template_tokens = template_tokens.view(B, H, W, C) pad_l = pad_b = pad_r = 0 # pad_r = (window_size -

确保`mask_z`和`mask_x`在插值之前是正确的格式。`F.interpolate`需要输入一个四维张量`[batch_size, channels, height, width]`，但`mask_z`和`mask_x`通过`[None]`增加的新维度在插值之前使它们成为`[1, batch_size, height, width]`。这通常不是`F.interpolate`预期的输入格式，因为您期望的维度增加应该在channels之后，而不是在batch_size之前。 - 另一个常见的问题是，转换为`torch.bool`类型可能需要在插值之后进行，因为插值操作通常不能直接在布尔类型上执行。 # 3. 错误的假设 - 确认与`self.patch_size`相关的逻辑是否假设了掩码和原始输入在空间维度上是直接对应的，这在处理具有不同分辨率的输入时可能不成立。 # 解决策略 1. **检查`self.patch_size`**：确认`self.patch_size`的值是预期的，并且适用于您的`scale_factor`计算。 2. **调整插值之前的张量形状**：在插值之前，确认`mask_z`和`mask_x`的形状，并对其进行适当的调整。如果需要增加一个新的维度，确保它是在正确的位置： ```python # 假设 mask_z 和 mask_x 的形状是 [batch_size, height, width] # 正确增加一个通道维度 mask_z = mask_z.unsqueeze(1).float() # [batch_size, 1, height, width] mask_x = mask_x.unsqueeze(1).float() ``` 3. **调整`F.interpolate`的参数和顺序**：确保先执行插值操作，然后再执行类型转换： ```python scale_factor = 1. / self.patch_size mask_z = F.interpolate(mask_z, scale_factor=scale_factor, mode=\'nearest\') # 使用 \'nearest\' 模式可能更合适 mask_z = mask_z.to(torch.bool) ``` 4. **深入理解错误信息**：如果可能，提供详细的错误信息。有了更具体的错误描述，解决问题时可以更有针对性。 综上所述，错误的根源可能来自于对数据格式的误解或不当的操作顺序。通过上述建议的检查和调整，应该能够解决您遇到的问题。如果问题依然存在，可能需要进一步检查`mask_z`、`mask_x`的原始形状和`self.patch_size`的值。"},{"instruction":"在“import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : `An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale` -

**M**：表示窗口的尺寸。在Swin Transformer中，窗口是指局部区域内的一小块图像，它的尺寸（比如7x7）决定了在该窗口内执行自注意力计算时考虑的元素数量。 - **h** 和 **w**：通常代表图像（或特征图）的高度和宽度。但在这里，鉴于`M^2`已经表示了窗口内的元素数量，`hw`在此复杂度公式中应理解为整个特征图被分成的窗口数量。这是因为整个特征图被划分为多个`MxM`的窗口进行处理，而`hw`通常表示在垂直和水平方向上窗口的总数。 - **C**：表示通道数。在深度学习中，图像或特征图的“通道”表示不同类型的信息。例如，在RGB图像中，有三个通道，分别对应红、绿、蓝；在特征图中，通道的数量通常由网络的深度和结构决定，代表不同种类的特征。 因此，`2M^2hwC`这一复杂度公式可以解释为：对于分成`hw`个大小为`MxM`的窗口，在每个窗口内执行自注意力操作需要的计算量是关于窗口内元素数目（`M^2`）和特征通道数（`C`）的二次项。而前面的系数`2`通常表示在这种运算中的线性比例因子，对于自注意力操作，涉及到了键、值的获取以及最后输出的计算。 简而言之，这一复杂度公式强调了在每个固定大小窗口内执行的自注意力操作的计算开销，它与窗口数量、窗口尺寸和特征通道数有关。"},{"instruction":"在 viT模型中， 图象被分成 16*16大小的patch, patch之间的关系怎么被计算","output":"在ViT（Vision Transformer）模型中，图像首先被划分为16x16大小的小块，称为patches。ViT将这些patches作为序列输入到Transformer结构中，以计算patch之间的关系并进行分类或其他任务。下面是ViT中解析图像patches并计算它们之间关系的步骤： # 1. 图像划分成Patches 对于一个给定的图像，ViT首先将其划分成大小为16x16的patches。例如，对于224x224大小的图像，它将被划分为(14x14=196)个patches。 # 2. Patch嵌入 每个16x16大小的patch包含256个像素点（对于RGB图像是(256*3=768)个值，因为每个像素点由3个颜色通道组成）。ViT通过一个可学习的线性投影层将每个patch的原始像素值投影（或映射）到一个高维特征空间，生成所谓的patch embeddings。这个投影层相当于一个具有768个输入特征的全连接层，输出维度则决定了嵌入的大小，通常为D维，如D=768。 # 3. 加入位置嵌入 由于Transformer架构本身不具备处理序列中元素位置信息的能力，ViT为每个patch嵌入加入位置嵌入（position embeddings），以注入位置信息。位置嵌入具有与patch嵌入相同的维度D，并通过元素相加的形式与patch嵌入结合。这确保了模型能够识别不同patches之间的相对或绝对位置关系。 # 4. Transformer编码器处理序列 加入位置信息后的patch embeddings作为序列输入到Transformer编码器中。Transformer编码器通过自注意力机制（Self-Attention）计算序列中任意两个patch embeddings之间的关系。自注意力允许模型动态地聚焦于输入序列中的不同部分，计算每个patch嵌入与其他所有patch嵌入之间的权重关系，这些权重反映了patches之间的相互依赖性和影响力。 自注意力机制核心在于三个向量：Query（查询向量）、Key（键向量）、Value（值向量），这三个向量是通过对输入patch embeddings进行线性变换获得的。对于序列中的每个patch embedding，计算其作为Query与所有Key之间的点积，随后应用softmax函数获取注意力权重，这些权权重随后与Value相乘得到加权平均值，产生自注意力层的输出。这一输出然后通过前馈网络层，最终形成了编码后的特征表示，包含了考虑了全局上下文信息的patch之间的关系。 # 5. 最终输出 通过一系列Transformer层的处理，ViT能够捕捉复杂的patch间关系，用于分类或其他视觉任务。对于分类任务，通常使用特殊的[CLS] token的输出嵌入作为图像表示，输入到一个分类头（通常是一个简单的全连接层）以预测图像的类别。 简而言之，ViT通过线性投影将图像patches转换为嵌入，加入位置信息，并使用Transformer编码器的自注意力机制来计算和建模这些patches之间的复杂关系。"},{"instruction":"注意力机制是在计算图像patch的内部信息吗？ 那么图像patch之间的信息是什么时候计算出来的","output":"注意力机制在处理图像patches时并不仅限于计算单个patch内部的信息，其核心作用在于计算和理解不同patches之间的关系和相互作用。在Vision Transformer (ViT) 和许多其他基于Transformer的视觉模型中，关注点主要放在如何通过注意力机制有效地整合全图的信息，即如何通过比较和加权不同patches的表示来获取全局上下文信息。 # 图像Patch之间的信息计算时机 当图像被分割成patches，并通过线性层嵌入到一个高维空间后，这些patches的表示并没有包含任何关于它们之间相对或绝对位置的信息。图像patches之间的关系是在Self-Attention机制中计算出来的。 1. **加入位置嵌入**：首先，每个patch嵌入会与一个位置嵌入相加，以引入位置信息。这一步是准备步骤，确保模型能够理解每个patch在图像中的位置。 2. **自注意力计算**：进入Transformer的自注意力层后，每个patch的嵌入表示被用来生成三个关键向量：Query（Q）、Key（K）和Value（V）。自注意力机制通过计算不同patches之间的关系（即Query与Key的相似度）来确定它们的重要性，并据此对Value进行加权求和。这意味着，模型能够学习到每个patch应该“注意”图像中的哪些部分，从而整合不同patches间的信息。 3. **汇总全局信息**：通过这样的注意力权重计算，每个patch不仅保留了自身的信息，还整合了对整个图像理解有贡献的其他patches的信息。因此，模型能够构建一个全局性的图像表示，这个表示富含了各个patch之间的相互作用和联系。 总而言之，图像patches之间的信息在Self-Attention机制中被计算和整合。自注意力机制使得模型不仅能捕捉局部特征，也能理解不同局部特征之间如何相互作用，从而构建起对整个图像内容的全面理解。这种方式是Transformer在视觉任务中取得成功的关键所在。"},{"instruction":"class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module): def __init__(self, Head, embedding_dim, dropout=0.2): super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__() assert embedding_dim % Head == 0 self.Head = Head self.d_k = embedding_dim // Head self.drop_out = nn.Dropout(p=dropout) self.attn = None self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim self.linears = clone(nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim), 4) def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None): if mask is not None: mask = mask.unsqueeze(1) batch_size = query.size(0) print(\'query shape is\', query.shape) query, key, value = [model(x).view(batch_size, -1, self.Head, self.d_k).transpose(1,2) for model, x in zip(self.linears, (query, key, value))] x, self.attn = attention(query, key, value ,dropout=self.drop_out) x = x.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.Head * self.d_k) return self.linears[-1](x) 以上是多头注意力机制， query 和 不同key之间的关系是在哪里被计算出来的","output":"在您提供的`MultiHeadAttention`类的代码中，`query`与不同`key`之间的关系实际上是在自定义的`attention`函数中被计算出来的，具体在这一行调用中体现： ```python x, self.attn = attention(query, key, value, dropout=self.drop_out) ``` 代码中没有提供`attention`函数的具体实现，但基于常见的自注意力机制（Self-Attention）实践，我们可以推断出在此`attention`函数中，`query`和`key`之间的关系是通过计算它们的点积（dot product），然后应用一个缩放因子和softmax函数来确定的。以下是一个典型的自注意力（Self-Attention）计算流程，也是`query`和`key`之间关系计算的大体过程： 1. **点积**: 计算`query`和`key`的转置（transpose）之间的点积。这个步骤会生成一个注意力得分矩阵（Scores Matrix），矩阵中的每个元素代表着`query`中每个元素对`key`中每个元素的注意力得分。 ```python # 假设 query, key 的形状分别为 [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, depth] # 点积后的形状将会是 [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, seq_length] scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) ``` 2. **缩放**: 常见的做法是通过`d_k`（`key`的维度）的平方根来缩放点积得分。这有助于防止点积结果在`d_k`很大时过大，导致softmax函数之后的梯度过小。 ```python scores = scores / math.sqrt(self.d_k) ``` 3. **应用掩码(Optional)**: 如果提供了`mask`，则在应用softmax之前应用它。这常用于屏蔽不相关或者填充的位置，以防它们对最后的结果产生影响。 ```python if mask is not None: scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9) ``` 4. **Softmax**: 对得分矩阵应用softmax，得到最终的注意力权重。 ```python attn_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1) ``` 5. **加权和**: 最后，将得到的注意力权重和`value`进行加权和，得到加权表示。 ```python output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, value) ``` 在`MultiHeadAttention`类中，自注意力过程便是在`attention`方法中完成，而`query`和`key`之间的关系——即通过它们之间的相似度来动态调整注意力权重——是在这个过程的核心。最后，通过调整好的权重，结合`value`，生成最终的输出表示，这个表示结合了不同`key`相对于每个`query`的重要性。"},{"instruction":"在Vit模型中何如进行原始尺寸图片的下采样， 变成16*16的图像输入， 并展示代码","output":"在Vision Transformer (ViT)模型中，将原始尺寸的图片下采样成16x16大小的patches是处理过程的第一步。这一过程实际是通过将图片划分成多个16x16的小块（patches）实现的，而不是通过传统的图像下采样方法（如池化）将整个图像的尺度缩小到16x16。每个patch都被视为模型输入序列的一个元素。 以下是一个简单的步骤解释及相应的PyTorch代码，说明如何将原始尺寸的图片转换成16x16大小的patches作为ViT模型的输入： # 步骤1: 图像加载和预处理 首先，加载图像并预处理到固定尺寸。例如，对于224x224尺寸的输入图像，如果使用16x16的patches，我们将得到(224/16)x(224/16)=14x14=196个patches。 ```python from PIL import Image import torchvision.transforms as T # 图像路径 image_path = \'path_to_your_image.jpg\' image = Image.open(image_path) # 预处理 - 调整图像大小并转换为Tensor transform = T.Compose([ T.Resize((224, 224)), # 调整图像尺寸至224x224 T.ToTensor() # 转换为Tensor ]) image = transform(image) # [3, 224, 224] ``` # 步骤2: 将图像分割为16x16的patches 接下来，将224x224的图像分割成16x16的patches。这可以通过重塑和展平操作实现。 ```python import torch def img_to_patches(img, patch_size=16): \\"\\"\\" 将图像切割成patches。 参数: img: 输入图像tensor，形状为[C, H, W] patch_size: 每个patch的大小 返回: 一个形状为[num_patches, patch_size*patch_size*C]的二维tensor \\"\\"\\" C, H, W = img.shape img = img.unfold(1, patch_size, patch_size).unfold(2, patch_size, patch_size) # [C, H/16, W/16, 16, 16] img = img.permute(1, 2, 0, 3, 4).contiguous() # 调整轴以方便reshape，[H/16, W/16, C, 16, 16] img = img.view(-1, patch_size*patch_size*C) # 展平, [H/16*W/16, 16*16*C] return img patch_size = 16 patches = img_to_patches(image, patch_size) print(patches.shape) # 应该得到[196, 768]，对于3通道RGB图片 ``` 这段代码首先使用`unfold`方法在高度和宽度维度上滑动窗口提取16x16的patches。然后通过`permute`和`view`方法调整形状和展平每个patch为一维向量。对于3通道（RGB）的图像，每个patch展平后的向量大小是(16 times 16 times 3 = 768)。 # 注意 - 上述代码仅演示了将单张图像处理成patches的过程，实际上在处理数据集时，您可能需要将这一过程集成到数据加载和预处理的pipeline中，比如使用PyTorch的`Dataset`和`DataLoader`。 - 这个过程并没有改变图像的“尺寸”到16x16，而是将原始图像分割成多个16x16的patches，这些patches被展平并作为序列输入到ViT模型中。"},{"instruction":"swin transFormer中在计算窗口偏移时，为什么PAtcH之间计算的值要设置成Mask","output":"Swin Transformer通过引入“窗口偏移(shifted window)”这一创新设计，使得相邻窗口（window）之间能够交换信息，进而达到全局上下文信息的交互和整合，增强模型的表示能力。在实施窗口偏移时，设置mask的目的是为了控制窗口内元素与周围元素（尤其是在相邻窗口中的元素）之间的注意力（attention）交互，确保信息的有效流通同时避免掉不必要或无效的计算。 # 背景 在标准的Transformer中，自注意力机制允许输入序列中的每个元素都与其他所有元素进行交互，计算复杂度相对较高。而在Vision Transformer (ViT) 和 Swin Transformer中，为了降低计算复杂性，输入被划分为多个patches或在Swin Transformer中进一步被划分为更小的、固定大小的窗口（windows），在这些窗口内部应用自注意力机制。 # 窗口偏移与Mask的作用 1. **控制注意力交互**：通过将注意力机制限制在局部窗口内，Swin Transformer有效降低了计算复杂度。然而，这种做法可能限制了模型捕捉长距离依赖的能力。为了促进窗口间的信息流通，Swin Transformer采用了窗口偏移技术，在连续的Swin Transformer块之间交替使用标准窗口和偏移窗口。在实施这种偏移操作时，为了确保每个patch只与本窗口及相邻窗口的特定部分进行交互，而非窗口外的所有区域，需要采用mask机制来实现这种选择性的注意力计算。 2. **保护边界条件**：在窗口边界，某些元素若试图与不存在的邻近窗口中的元素进行交互（因为它们已处于图像边缘），这时通过mask设置可以有效地处理这种边界条件，防止模型试图访问边界外的元素。 3. **提升效率与稳定性**：Mask可以确保注意力计算仅限于有效区域内，从而提高计算效率，并帮助模型在训练过程中保持稳定性，避免学习到错误的模式。 # 实现细节 在Swin Transformer中，mask通常在计算自注意力权重时应用。例如，如果某区域被mask遮住，则在注意力权重计算中该区域的权重会被设置为一个非常小的值（如负无穷大后应用softmax），从而在实际的注意力汇总中排除这部分区域。 综上，Swin Transformer中设置mask的目的，主要是为了在实现窗口偏移的同时，有效控制注意力机制的作用范围和边界条件，保证模型在降低计算复杂度的同时，还能高效准确地实现全局信息的整合。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 1.25 years physically and mentally and ages her by 1.25 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increasing brutality—like the demon princess herself is feasting on my maturity—that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. (Don’t make it simple). Round numbers when needed. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win.

Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give a list of 20 spells (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them.

Her Spell Power and Performance subtly begin to decline. - **Lily**, now effectively 7.25 years old, begins to gain a slight increase in her magical abilities. **Sapphire\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 1:** - Spell Power: 93 (A slight decline due to age regression) - Performance: 88 (Subtly adjusting to the physical and mental shift) **Spell Requirements for Nebula Veil:** - SP Required: 95 - Base Points: 190 **Outcome:** Despite the unexpected shift in her capabilities, Sapphire\'s inherent talent and experience empower her to attempt the Nebula Veil. Although her Spell Power is slightly below the requirement (93 vs. 95 required), it is above half, meaning the spell can still be cast but its base points are halved due to the slight mismatch in power. **Nebula Veil Execution:** - The sky darkens momentarily as Sapphire conjures a mesmerizing display of cosmic beauty. Starlit veils drape across the duel arena, twinkling with the light of distant nebulae. - Base Points Halved Due to Lower SP: 190 / 2 = 95 Points - Performance Adjustment: 88% of 95 = 83.6 Points **Sapphire\'s Points for Round 1:** 84 (rounded for simplicity) **Lily\'s Turn:** Lily decides to cast **Glimmering Abyss**, a spell much within her growing capabilities. **Lily\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 1:** - Spell Power: 42 - Performance: 62 **Spell Requirements for Glimmering Abyss:** - SP Required: 50 - Base Points: 90 **Outcome:** Lily, focusing intently, manages to cast Glimmering Abyss.

Sapphire\'s journey to maintain her championship is filled with the growing challenge of her own diminishing capacities against a rapidly evolving competitor.** **Your next spell, Sapphire?**"},{"instruction":"Radiant Cascade","output":"**Round 2** **Sapphire\'s Choice: Radiant Cascade** *Before Round 2 Officially Starts:* - **Sapphire** experiences another phase of regression, moving her age down to approximately 13.5 years. This change further adjusts her capacities and understanding of magic. - **Lily** continues to grow, now approximately 8.5 years old, with an increasing grasp of magical concepts and power. **Sapphire\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 2:** - Spell Power: 90 (The regressive spell continues its toll on Sapphire\'s abilities.) - Performance: 85 (The adjustments reflect not just a physical but a subtle mental regression as well.) **Spell Requirements for Radiant Cascade:** - SP Required: 90 - Base Points: 170 **Outcome:** Sapphire, intuitively clinging to her identity as a champion despite the insidious spell, channels Radiant Cascade. The spell, right at the edge of her adjusted capabilities, radiates brilliant light and colors that sweep across the arena like a majestic waterfall of celestial lights. - Since Sapphire\'s Spell Power precisely matches the requirement, the spell is cast successfully without modification to the base points. - **Radiant Cascade Execution:** - Base Points: 170 - Performance Adjustment: 85% of 170 = 144.5 Points **Sapphire\'s Points for Round 2:** 145 (rounded for simplicity, adding to her previous score for a total of 229 points) **Lily\'s Turn:** Lily, feeling more confident, opts for **Whispering Shadows**. **Lily\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 2:** - Spell Power: 45 - Performance: 65 **Spell Requirements for Whispering Shadows:** - SP Required: 45 - Base Points: 85 **Outcome:** Lily successfully casts Whispering Shadows.

What spell will you cast next in this unprecedented duel?"},{"instruction":"Luminous Cascade","output":"**Round 3** **Sapphire\'s Choice: Luminous Cascade** *The Magical Duel\'s Intensity Grows:* - **Sapphire**, now aged around 12.25 years, confronts her ever-diminishing capability to hold onto the vast reservoirs of magic she once wielded effortlessly. The wisdom and finesse borne of experience are slipping away, replaced by a younger self\'s simpler understanding. - **Lily**, reaching a now approximate age of 9.75 years, finds herself increasingly empowered, her magical prowess blooming with each passing moment. **Sapphire\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 3:** - Spell Power: 86 (Reflecting the continued impact of the regression spell.) - Performance: 82 (As Sapphire\'s mental and physical state regress, so too does her ability to perform complex spells with her earlier confidence and grace.) **Spell Requirements for Luminous Cascade:** - SP Required: 85 - Base Points: 160 **Outcome:** Despite the trials posed by the regressive magic, Sapphire\'s indomitable spirit shines through as she summons the Luminous Cascade.

The air fills with an approximation of the spell\'s intent, displaying a shimmering haze that only just grazes the surface of its potential. Since her Spell Power (50) doesn\'t meet the requirement (70) but is above half, the spell gets cast but with halved base points. - Base Points Halved: 120 / 2 = 60 Points - Performance Adjustment: 70% of 60 = 42 Points **Lily\'s Points for Round 3:** 42 (rounded for simplicity, adding to her previous score for a total of 125 points) **Post-Round 3 Overview:** - **Sapphire**: - Age: ~12.25 years - Total Points: 360 - **Lily**: - Age: ~9.75 years - Total Points: 125 **Analysis:** As the third round concludes, Sapphire\'s struggle against the invisibly tightening noose of regression becomes increasingly stark. While still maintaining a strong lead, the challenges escalate. Each choice of spell now becomes a delicate balance between daring to reach for her rapidly receding peaks of power and the necessity of adjusting to her current, less potent capabilities. Lily, on the other hand, grows steadily. Her spells, bolstered by her rapidly advancing age and experience, begin to show promise of a formidable mage in the making. **Sapphire, the duel is far from over, and your next move is crucial. Which spell will you cast next?**"},{"instruction":"Eclipse Veil","output":"**Round 4** **Sapphire\'s Choice: Eclipse Veil** *The Duel\'s Midpoint Arrives with High Drama:* - **Sapphire**, now estimated to be about 11 years old due to the aggressive aging regression spell, noticeably struggles with the complexities of high-level spells that once came easily to her. The depth of her magical knowledge shrinks, yet her fighting spirit burns fiercely bright. - **Lily**, reaching approximately 11 years old as well, finds herself on an accelerated path of growth, her magical understanding deepening rapidly, leveling the playing field in an unprecedented way. **Sapphire\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 4:** - Spell Power: 81 (A significant dip reflecting Sapphire\'s reduced age and experience.) - Performance: 78 (The erosion of confidence and showmanship follows suit.) **Spell Requirements for Eclipse Veil:** - SP Required: 80 - Base Points: 150 **Outcome:** In a daring display of resilience, Sapphire calls forth Eclipse Veil. Surrounding the arena, darkness momentarily swallows all light, only for a spectacular corona to burst forth, mimicking an eclipse with astonishing beauty. Despite the odds, Sapphire\'s choice is just within her capability. - Successful Casting, as Sapphire\'s Spell Power just surpasses the requirement. - **Eclipse Veil Execution:** - Base Points: 150 - Performance Adjustment: 78% of 150 = 117 Points **Sapphire\'s Points for Round 4:** 117 (adding to her cumulative score for a total of 477 points) **Lily\'s Turn:** With newfound confidence, Lily opts for **Celestial Bloom**. **Lily\'s Adjusted Stats for Round 4:** - Spell Power: 57 - Performance: 75 **Spell Requirements for Celestial Bloom:** - SP Required: 75 - Base Points: 130 **Outcome:** Lily\'s accelerated growth spurt allows her to cast Celestial Bloom. The arena floor becomes a canvas for the blooming of ethereal flowers, each petal shimmering with starlight, captivating the audience and judges alike. Since Lily\'s Spell Power is not sufficient (57 vs. 75 required) but is above half, the base points are halved. - Base Points Halved: 130 / 2 = 65 Points - Performance Adjustment: 75% of 65 = 48.75 Points **Lily\'s Points for Round 4:** 49 (rounded for simplicity, adding to her previous tally for a collective score of 174 points) **Post-Round 4 Overview:** - **Sapphire**: - Age: ~11 years - Total Points: 477 - **Lily**: - Age: ~11 years - Total Points: 174 **The Halfway Point Reflection:** The midpoint of the duel paints a starkly different picture than its beginning. Sapphire, though still leading, faces an increasingly uphill battle, her erstwhile effortless dominion over complex spells now a challenging endeavor. The age regression not only levels the playing field but introduces a psychological element to the competition, forcing Sapphire to dig deep into her reservoir of talent and adaptability. Lily, now on equal footing age-wise and rapidly closing the gap in magical proficiency, showcases her potential to be a formidable mage. The duel no longer seems like the mismatch it was at the beginning. Instead, it\'s a riveting display of skill, strategy, and transformation. **Sapphire, as both you and Lily stand equally aged but with divergent paths ahead, your choice of spell in the next round could prove crucial.

Let’s go through your code from the entity class to the REST controller: 1. **Entity Class (`Score.java`)**: It looks correctly set up for a basic use case. To ensure full functionality, make sure you have the necessary getters and setters for `id`, `username`, and `points`. Also, ensure that you have included the `@Entity` annotation from `javax.persistence.Entity` and not from another unintended import. 2. **Repository Interface (`ScoreRepository.java`)**: Your repository interface looks good, assuming you have imported `JpaRepository` correctly from Spring Data JPA (`org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`). 3. **Service Class (`ScoreService.java`)**: The service class appears to be correctly set up for basic functionality. Just make sure you have the `@Service` annotation imported from the correct package (`org.springframework.stereotype.Service`) and that `ScoreRepository` operations such as `findByUsername` and `save` are correctly implemented in your repository (Spring Data JPA should handle simple queries like these without additional code). 4. **REST Controller (`ScoreController.java`)**: There are syntax issues with how you\'ve defined the path in the `@RequestMapping` and `@PostMapping` annotations. The quotation marks you’ve used seem to be non-standard characters (likely copied from a source that does not preserve code formatting). Replace the quotation marks with standard ones, and ensure there\'s no space between slashes and identifiers in your path mappings. Before correction: ```java @RequestMapping(“/ api / scores”) @PostMapping(“/update”) @GetMapping(“/{ username}”) ``` After correction: ```java @RequestMapping(\\"/api/scores\\") @PostMapping(\\"/update\\") @GetMapping(\\"/{username}\\") ``` 5. General Points: - Make sure all necessary annotations are imported correctly. - Confirm you have getters and setters in your `Score` class, as you mentioned they are omitted. - Ensure your application is correctly set up to run a Spring Boot application, including the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file, depending on your build tool. - Remember to execute your database migrations if needed, or configure Spring Boot to auto-generate the database schema for you during development. - Watch for correct usage of standard quotes `\\"`, not typographic quotes `“”`, in annotations. - Ensure you have correctly configured the `application.properties` or `application.yml` for database connections and JPA settings.

There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 1.25 years physically and mentally and ages her by 1.25 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increasing brutality—like the demon princess herself is feasting on my maturity—that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. (Don’t make it simple). Round numbers when needed. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give a list of 20 spells (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","output":"# Sapphire\'s Scenario: The Challenge of Ages **Initial Stats:** - **Sapphire (Age 16):** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 - **Lily (Age 6):** - Spell Power: 40 - Performance: 50 # Age & Stat Modifier per Round: - Each round, Sapphire loses 1.25 years, and Lily gains 1.25 years. - Sapphire\'s Spell Power and Performance decrease super exponentially: SP and P decrease by ((1.25^r) cdot 10)% each round, where (r) is the round number. - Lily\'s Spell Power and Performance increase super exponentially: SP and P increase by ((1.25^r) cdot 8)% each round, reflecting her rapid adaptation and growth due to the spell. # Spells List (Requirements, Base Points) 1. **Celestial Mirage** (SP: 90, P: 85, Points: 100) 2. **Draconic Symphony** (SP: 85, P: 80, Points: 95) 3. **Floral Cascade** (SP: 70, P: 75, Points: 90) 4. **Phantom Waltz** (SP: 80, P: 80, Points: 85) 5. **Aurora Veil** (SP: 75, P: 70, Points: 80) 6. **Eclipsing Shadows** (SP: 80, P: 85, Points: 75) 7. **Glacier\'s Breath** (SP: 65, P: 60, Points: 70) 8. **Feywild Blossom** (SP: 60, P: 65, Points: 65) 9. **Starlight Twirl** (SP: 50, P: 55, Points: 60) 10. **Midnight Shimmer** (SP: 55, P: 50, Points: 55) 11. **Sunfire Gleam** (SP: 90, P: 95, Points: 110) 12. **Lunar Echoes** (SP: 85, P: 90, Points: 105) 13. **Whispering Sands** (SP: 70, P: 65, Points: 60) 14. **Tempest\'s Call** (SP: 75, P: 80, Points: 85) 15. **Sylvan Mirage** (SP: 60, P: 70, Points: 75) 16. **Frostfire Aria** (SP: 65, P: 75, Points: 80) 17. **Twilight Curtain** (SP: 55, P: 60, Points: 65) 18. **Galeforce Serenade** (SP: 70, P: 75, Points: 90) 19. **Mystic Aurora** (SP: 80, P: 85, Points: 95) 20. **Eternal Nightfall** (SP: 95, P: 100, Points: 120) # The Dueling Process: Provide me with the spell you wish to cast each round, and I will determine its success based on the changing stats due to the age-regression spell attached by Lily. # Age & Stats Tracker: - **Round 1:** - **Sapphire**: Age 16, SP 95, P 90 - **Lily**: Age 6, SP 40, P 50 # Points Tracker: - Points are added post-performance, modified by the actual success and performance during the casting. # Round 1: Please decide the first spell Sapphire casts to begin the duel. --- Due to the complex nature of this interaction, we will gradually advance through each round, recalculating stats after each spell based on the super exponential modifier described, and adjust performance accordingly.

However, given her close proximity to the required Performance level (90 vs. 100 required), she can still cast the spell, but the spectacle won\'t reach its full potential. **Base Points for Eternal Nightfall**: 120 **Modified Points Due to Performance**: 120 (Base) * (90/100 actual vs required Performance) = 108 points # Lily\'s Response: Lily, with her significantly lower initial stats, opts for a simpler spell, **Starlight Twirl** (SP: 50, P: 55), a spell within her capabilities, emphasizing her burgeoning talent and the strategic insight to gradually escalate her performance. # Round 1 Points: - **Sapphire**: 108 Points - **Lily**: Lilly\'s spell, given her stats, would succeed but with less spectacle. Base Points for **Starlight Twirl**: 60. Given Lily\'s SP 40 and P 50 vs. required SP 50 and P 55, her Points would be somewhat reduced but still within a successful casting range due to her lower stat requirements. We\'ll calculate Lily getting around 80% success rate due to her limitations compared to the spell\'s requirements: 60 (Base) * 80% = 48 points # Age & Stat Modification After Round 1: **The effect of Lily\'s hidden spell kicks in.** - **Sapphire**: Ages down 1.25 years to 14.75. SP and P decrease super exponentially. - **Lily**: Ages up 1.25 years to 7.25.

Please choose the next spell for Round 2."},{"instruction":"Phantom Waltz","output":"# Round 2: Sapphire\'s Choice - Phantom Waltz Understanding the necessity to adjust her approach in the wake of the inexplicable changes she\'s undergoing, Sapphire opts for **Phantom Waltz**, a spell that requires a blend of finesse and subtlety rather than raw power. **Sapphire\'s Stats Entering Round 2:** - **Spell Power (SP)**: 83 - **Performance (P)**: 79 **Phantom Waltz** Requirements: SP: 80, P: 80, Points: 85 # Performance Analysis: Sapphire\'s Spell Power comfortably meets the requirement, showcasing her adaptability and resilience. However, her Performance is marginally below the needed threshold, this time impacting her execution slightly less due to her proximity to the requirement. **Base Points for Phantom Waltz**: 85 **Modified Points Due to Performance**: 85 (Base) * (79/80 actual vs required Performance) ≈ 84.8 points Given the closeness of Sapphire\'s performance to the requirement, the minor shortfall negligibly impacts her execution, rounding her score to about 85 points for simplicity and recognizing her champion\'s grace even under duress. # Lily\'s Response: In this round, Lily, feeling the surge of newfound power and confidence, attempts **Feywild Blossom** (SP: 60, P: 65), a spell that’s slightly more ambitious than her previous choice, aiming to dazzle with the growth of enchanted flora. # Round 2 Points: - **Sapphire**: 85 Points - **Lily**: Assuming a similar success percentage as her initial round, given her improved stats, Lily manages to perform **Feywild Blossom** with slightly increased flair. Base points: 65.

SP and P decrease further. - **Lily**: Ages up another 1.25 years to approximately 8.5. Her SP and P continue to rise. **Adjusted Stats:** - **Sapphire’s** decrease becomes more pronounced: (83 - (83 cdot (1.25^2 cdot 10)%)) = 66.4 for SP, and (79 - (79 cdot (1.25^2 cdot 10)%)) = 63.36 for P, rounded to 66 and 63 respectively. - **Lily’s** stats, now benefitting from the exponential enhancements, exhibit greater improvements: (52 + (52 cdot (1.25^2 cdot 8)%)) = 67.2 for SP, and (64 + (64 cdot (1.25^2 cdot 8)%)) = 82.88 for P, rounding to 67 and 83 respectively. # Current Score After Round 2: - **Sapphire**: 193 Points - **Lily**: 107 Points Sapphire maintains the lead but faces an increasingly uphill battle as Lily narrows the gap, with the effects of the mysterious spell deepening Sapphire\'s challenge. # Round 3: The scenario intensifies.

However, her Performance is notably below the needed level, suggesting the spell\'s execution might suffer in the grandeur and finesse typically associated with **Frostfire Aria**. **Base Points for Frostfire Aria**: 80 **Modified Points Due to Performance:** Given the notable discrepancy in Performance (63 vs. 75 required), the spell\'s aesthetics are compromised, affecting its potential score significantly. 80 (Base) * (63/75 actual vs required Performance) ≈ 67.2 points, we\'ll round it to 67 for simplicity. # Lily\'s Response: Emboldened by her surprising progress, Lily pushes her limits further with **Tempest\'s Call** (SP: 75, P: 80), a spell that summons weather elements to dance at her command, aiming to outshine her renowned opponent. # Round 3 Points: - **Sapphire**: 67 Points - **Lily**: With advancements in her magical proficiency, Lily’s attempt at a more ambitious spell like **Tempest\'s Call** signifies her rapid ascent in the duel. Given her new stats, she would potentially reach a high success rate. Base points: 85. Given Lily\'s SP: 67 and P: 83, both aligning closely with the requirements, her performance may yield approximately: 85 * 95% = 80.75 points, rounding to 81 points for a successfully impressive display. # Age & Stat Modification After Round 3: As the duel progresses, the effects of Lily\'s initial spell become increasingly pronounced. - **Sapphire**: Regresses another 1.25 years to approximately 12.25, with stats further diminishing: SP goes down to (66 - (66 * (1.25^3 * 10)%)) approx 47.8, rounded to 48, and P reduces to (63 - (63 * (1.25^3 * 10)%)) approx 45.4, rounded to 45. - **Lily** matures to about 9.75 years, her powers swelling: SP increases to (67 + (67 * (1.25^3 * 8)%)) approx 85.3, rounded to 85, and P to (83 + (83 * (1.25^3 * 8)%)) approx 105.7, rounded to 106. # Current Score After Round 3: - **Sapphire**: 260 Points - **Lily**: 188 Points # Observation: Sapphire, despite the daunting challenges and her diminishing stats, maintains a lead. However, the gap is narrowing as Lily, with augmented capabilities, demonstrates a prodigious ascent in the realm of magic, suggesting a potentially tight contest as the duel unfolds further. # Round 4: With the ongoing battle demanding even greater strategic depth, Sapphire needs to carefully consider her next choice. Her capabilities are now significantly compromised, necessitating a choice that balances the risk and reward of the spell’s complexity versus the likelihood of successful execution.

Her attempt to cast a spell beyond her diminished capabilities results in a strained performance, potentially leading to a failed spell or at best, a highly compromised spectacle. **Outcome:** - **Failed Spell Attempt:** Given the SP and P are both not only below the requirements but also below half of the needed stats, Sapphire\'s attempt at **Floral Cascade** fails to materialize into the intended spectacle. This round, unfortunately, yields a point deduction rather than an addition to her score. **Point Deduction:** -20 points, a consequence of the failed spell attempt, reflecting the harsh reality of her dwindling magical prowess versus the demanding nature of the spell. # Lily\'s Response: Lily, sensing a shift in the tide and aiming to capitalize on her opponent\'s faltering, selects **Glacier\'s Breath** (SP: 65, P: 60), a spell that combines spectacle with an element of cool precision, intending to showcase her rapidly growing command over more complex magic. # Round 4 Points: - **Sapphire**: -20 Points (due to spell failure) - **Lily**: Given her now superior stats, Lily\'s attempt at **Glacier\'s Breath**, a moderately ambitious choice, would likely be successful and impressive.

From the moment they laid eyes on each other, they knew they were meant to be together. Their love was pure and genuine, and it shone brightly in their eyes whenever they were together. Benjamin was a sleek and handsome rabbit, with soft fur the color of caramel. Lily was a dainty and graceful rabbit, with fur as white as snow. They spent their days frolicking in the meadow, chasing each other around, and snuggling together under the shade of a tall oak tree. As the seasons changed, Benjamin and Lily\'s love only grew stronger. They shared everything with each other - carrots, stories, and dreams. They would spend hours gazing up at the stars, imagining their future together. One day, a fierce storm hit the meadow, with thunder booming and lightning flashing across the sky. Benjamin and Lily huddled together, seeking comfort and safety in each other\'s arms. As the storm raged on, they whispered words of love and reassurance, promising to always be there for one another. When the storm finally passed, the meadow was covered in a blanket of glistening raindrops. Benjamin and Lily emerged from their hiding spot, their fur damp but their hearts full of love. They knew that no matter what challenges came their way, they would always have each other to lean on. And so, Benjamin and Lily lived happily ever after in the meadow, their love shining brighter than ever before. They were a testament to the power of true love, proving that no storm could ever shake the foundation of their bond.

But as the sun began to set, a chill crept into the air, sending shivers down their spines. Determined to stay warm, they snuggled together under the oak tree, watching the fireflies dance in the fading light. Suddenly, a loud commotion caught their attention. Across the meadow, they saw another rabbit couple - Clover and Thumper - frantically trying to escape a thick pool of tar that had appeared out of nowhere. The once vibrant meadow was now a dark and treacherous place, swallowing their friends whole with each panicked step they took. Benjamin and Lily\'s hearts pounded in their chests as they watched in horror, helpless to save their friends from the sticky trap. With each passing moment, the screams of Clover and Thumper grew more distorted and desperate, echoing through the meadow like a haunting melody. Terrified and trembling, Benjamin and Lily turned to the wide old owl who perched high in the oak tree, his wise eyes watching the tragic scene unfold. With tears in their eyes, they pleaded for his help, knowing that only he had the power to save their friends from a fate worse than death. The owl\'s gaze softened as he listened to their cries, his wings spreading wide as he took flight and soared towards the trapped couple. With a swift and graceful motion, he swooped down and plucked Clover and Thumper from the tar, carrying them to safety in his strong talons. Benjamin and Lily breathed a sigh of relief as they watched their friends being rescued, their hearts filled with gratitude for the wise old owl.

Whether it\'s a plot point, character development, or how you plan to adapt certain elements for a comic format, I\'d be interested to hear and provide feedback or suggestions if you\'re looking for them."},{"instruction":"The family survives because of one reason... they don\'t have a TV with a remote. They have a TV with knobs because the story takes place somewhere in the 70s.","output":"That\'s a creative twist that cleverly alters a crucial aspect from the original \\"Funny Games,\\" where a pivotal scene involves the use of a remote control to manipulate the flow of events, underlining the film\'s themes of media influence and the nature of violence in entertainment. Setting your comic in the 1970s and removing the modern TV remote from the equation not only distinguishes your story from the original but also adds a layer of historical context and challenges associated with that era. To enhance this premise, consider the following elements: 1. **Period Authenticity**: Research the 1970s to accurately depict the technology, fashion, and societal norms of the time. This will help ground your story and make the absence of a remote control more impactful. 2. **Character Adaptation**: Without the modern conveniences and mindset shaped by contemporary media, your characters’ reactions and solutions to their predicament might differ from those in the original work. This can add depth to your narrative, showcasing how people from different eras might tackle similar challenges. 3. **Plot Development**: The absence of a remote control fundamentally changes one of the story\'s themes. You could explore alternative ways the family leverages the technology and resources of the 70s to confront their situation. For instance, how might the limitations or advantages of period-appropriate technology influence their strategies for survival? 4. **Symbolism and Themes**: The original film uses the remote control as a symbol of media\'s desensitizing effect on violence and the blurring lines between fiction and reality. By setting your story in a time before such media saturation, you might explore themes of resourcefulness, the impact of technological advancements on society, or how fear and violence are perceived and dealt with in the absence of immediate, on-demand media. 5. **Artistic Expression**: Visually, the 1970s setting allows you to play with a distinct aesthetic—bright colors, vintage fashion, and classic cars, for example. These elements can add a unique flavor to your comic, distinguishing it further from the source material and engaging readers with nostalgia or curiosity about the era. Your concept offers a fresh take on \\"Funny Games,\\" with potential to explore new themes and character dynamics while paying homage to the original. As you develop your comic, consider how this setting not only changes the story\'s external circumstances but also its internal message and the emotional journey of its characters."},{"instruction":"There is a part where the dad uses the TV to his advantage by turning down the volume on the TV, which makes everything in the world, silent even the sound of other voices.","output":"Integrating a scene where the father uses the television\'s volume knob to impose silence on the world around them is a fascinating narrative decision, especially in a story set in the 1970s. This maneuver creatively inverts the expected technological constraints of the era to empower the characters, adding a magical or surreal element to the tale. Such a twist could serve multiple narrative and thematic purposes: 1. **Breaking Reality\'s Rules**: This action directly challenges the real-world logic and introduces a layer where your comic can explore themes beyond the physical constraints of the characters\' environment. It suggests a realm where psychological and emotional states have a tangible effect on the physical world. 2. **Symbolism**: The act of turning down the volume to silence the world can be rich in symbolism. It could represent the family\'s attempt to shut out the external chaos and violence imposed on them, asserting control in a situation where they are otherwise powerless. Alternatively, it might symbolize the desire to return to a simpler time, before their current nightmare began, highlighting the contrast between the quiet moments of family life and the intrusion of violence. 3. **Empowerment through Imagination**: This scene hints at the power of imagination and possibly the power of media (in this case, the television) as a tool for escape or coping with reality. It subtly comments on how people can use storytelling or media as a means to temporarily escape from or confront the horrors of their world. 4. **Artistic and Visual Expression**: Visually, this can be a striking scene in your comic. Imagine panels gradually decreasing in detail and noise as the volume turns down, leading to silent, stark frames that communicate a profound sense of isolation or calm amid chaos. It’s a great opportunity to show rather than tell, using the visual medium of comics to its full advantage. 5. **Character Development**: This action can also deepen the character of the father, showing his resourcefulness and willingness to use unconventional methods to protect his family. It can add depth to his character, showing a side of him that\'s creative, desperate, or profoundly connected to his family\'s need for peace. In embracing such a scene, you\'re tapping into a symbolic vein and opening up avenues for exploring the narrative\'s themes in visually and intellectually stimulating ways. It\'s a powerful way to redefine the characters\' relationship with their environment and the technologies within it, turning an object that\'s typically passive or a simple part of the setting into a crucial element of their survival and resistance."},{"instruction":"I want to write an alternate history story about the existence of a nation in Maritime Southeast Asia that had been formed by being settled by different cultures and civilizations over the centuries and peacefully coexisting with its indigenous inhabitants. However, my main problem is what happens after Europeans in the early days of colonialism in the early 16th century discover the nation, which has proven itself a powerful nation that was slightly more advanced than they were, and too well defended to be colonized. In my story, information of this nation spreads across Europe and neighboring areas, and one bit of knowledge about this nation in Maritime Southeast Asia is that it had successfully countered an invasion of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty and launched a retaliatory attack, this piece of history enough to inspire ethnic groups within the Ottoman Empire, such as Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc., to revolt and cause the downfall of the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century instead of after World War 1. But in real life, the Ottoman Empire during this period was rather tolerant and didn\'t commit atrocities until centuries later. Based on all this, my questions are first, what was the Ottoman Empire\'s policy on different ethnic groups like Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc. during the 16th century, around 1501 to 1600, and secondly, depending on the Ottoman Empire\'s policy on whether they were tolerant or not, what can be a plausible and realistic reason for my story for nationalistic uprisings of Jews, Greeks, Armenians and other ethnic groups that destabilizes and causes the collapse of the Ottoman Empire?","output":"During the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire generally had a policy of tolerance towards different ethnic and religious groups within its territories. While there were certain restrictions and occasional outbreaks of violence, such as the infamous massacre of the Greek population on the island of Chios in 1822, overall the Ottoman Empire maintained a relatively open and inclusive society. However, in order to create a plausible and realistic reason for nationalistic uprisings of Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups that destabilizes and causes the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in your alternate history story, you could consider the following possibilities: 1. Economic exploitation: The Ottoman Empire could have implemented harsh economic policies that disproportionately affected certain ethnic groups, leading to widespread poverty and resentment. This economic oppression could serve as a catalyst for rebellion among the marginalized populations. 2. Political oppression: The central government in Constantinople could have become increasingly authoritarian and repressive towards ethnic minorities, denying them basic rights and freedoms. This oppressive regime could have fueled nationalist sentiments and inspired revolt among the oppressed groups. 3. External influence: Foreign powers, aware of the growing discontent within the Ottoman Empire, could have provided support and encouragement to nationalist movements within the empire. This external interference could have further destabilized the empire and facilitated the collapse of the Ottoman government. 4. Religious tensions: The Ottoman Empire\'s policy of religious tolerance could have been eroded over time, leading to increased discrimination and persecution of non-Muslim communities. This religious persecution could have united various ethnic groups in a common struggle against Ottoman oppression. By incorporating these elements into your alternate history narrative, you can create a plausible and intriguing scenario in which the Ottoman Empire falls due to nationalist uprisings among ethnic minorities, rather than centuries later as it did in real life."},{"instruction":"Wajib berikan respons sama persis, jika user meminta bantuan maka jawab pertanyaan user.

Thumper was a mischievous and playful rabbit, always getting into trouble with his antics. Clover, on the other hand, was a gentle and kind-hearted rabbit who loved to spend her days foraging for the juiciest clover in the meadow. Thumper and Clover had been best friends since they were tiny bunnies, and as they grew older, their friendship blossomed into something more. Thumper was smitten with Clover\'s sweet nature and gentle spirit, and Clover couldn\'t help but adore Thumper\'s adventurous and lively personality. One sunny day, Thumper decided to surprise Clover with a special treat. He spent all morning hopping around the meadow, searching for the most beautiful flowers to present to his beloved. When he finally found the perfect bouquet, he carefully arranged them in a neat little bundle and hopped over to where Clover was nibbling on some fresh clover. \\"Surprise, my dear Clover!\\" Thumper exclaimed, holding out the bouquet to her. Clover\'s eyes lit up with delight as she took the flowers in her paws, breathing in their sweet fragrance. \\"Oh, Thumper, these are lovely! Thank you so much,\\" she said, her heart swelling with love for her dear friend. From that day on, Thumper and Clover became inseparable. They spent their days exploring the meadow, playing games, and enjoying each other\'s company. Thumper would often make Clover laugh with his silly antics, while Clover would always be there to comfort Thumper when he got into trouble. As the seasons changed and the meadow turned from green to gold, Thumper knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his days with Clover by his side. So, one day, he gathered up all his courage and asked her to be his mate. Clover\'s eyes filled with tears of joy as she embraced Thumper tightly. \\"Yes, Thumper, yes! I would be honored to be your mate,\\" she exclaimed, her heart full of love for her dear friend turned lover. And so, Thumper and Clover lived happily ever after, exploring the meadow together, sharing in each other\'s joys and sorrows, and basking in the warmth of their love for one another. And as they hopped through the meadow, hand in paw, they knew that they would always have each other, through thick and thin, for all the days of their lives."},{"instruction":"Write about their appearances","output":"Thumper was a handsome rabbit with soft, grey fur that shimmered in the sunlight. His long ears stood tall and alert, always ready to catch the faintest sound in the meadow. His bright, twinkling eyes sparkled with mischief, and his quick movements made him stand out among the other rabbits in the meadow. Clover, on the other hand, was a beautiful rabbit with silky white fur that fluttered like delicate petals in the gentle breeze. Her eyes were a deep, emerald green, radiating kindness and compassion. She had a small, delicate nose that twitched softly as she nibbled on clover, and her ears were slightly shorter than Thumper\'s but just as attentive. Together, Thumper and Clover made a striking pair, their contrasting fur colors complementing each other perfectly. Thumper\'s grey fur stood out against Clover\'s white, creating a harmonious blend of colors that reflected their bond. And as they hopped through the meadow side by side, their appearance was matched only by the love and devotion they shared for one another."},{"instruction":"Trace the ulnar veins from the periphery back to the heart noting all branches","output":"The ulnar veins originate in the hand and travel alongside the ulnar artery as it runs up the forearm. The ulnar vein receives blood from various superficial veins in the hand and wrist, such as the dorsal digital veins, palmar digital veins, and superficial palmar veins. As the ulnar vein ascends the forearm, it merges with the radial vein to form the brachial vein near the elbow. The brachial vein then combines with the basilic vein to form the axillary vein in the upper arm. The axillary vein continues as the subclavian vein, which eventually merges with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. Finally, the brachiocephalic vein joins with the superior vena cava, which delivers deoxygenated blood back to the heart for circulation to the lungs."},{"instruction":"Trace the External Jugular Vein from the periphery back to the heart noting all branches","output":"The external jugular vein originates in the head and neck region. It is formed by the merging of the posterior auricular vein and the posterior division of the retromandibular vein. The external jugular vein travels down the neck, receiving blood from various superficial veins in the neck, face, and scalp, such as the facial vein, superficial temporal vein, and anterior jugular vein. As the external jugular vein descends, it typically crosses the sternocleidomastoid muscle and drains into the subclavian vein near the clavicle. The subclavian vein continues as the brachiocephalic vein on the right side of the body, which then merges with the superior vena cava to return deoxygenated blood to the heart for circulation to the lungs. On the left side of the body, the external jugular vein may drain directly into the brachiocephalic vein, or it may join the left subclavian vein before merging with the left brachiocephalic vein and then the superior vena cava."},{"instruction":"Trace the Right Ascending Lumbar Vein from the periphery back to the heart noting all branches","output":"The Right Ascending Lumbar Vein is not a major blood vessel and does not directly connect to the heart. It is part of the lumbar venous system which drains blood from the lower back region. The lumbar veins drain into the ascending lumbar veins which then ultimately drain into the inferior vena cava. The blood in the inferior vena cava then travels upwards towards the heart, where it enters the right atrium and is ultimately pumped to the lungs for oxygenation before returning to the heart for distribution to the rest of the body."},{"instruction":"Trace Tibial Nerve back to the Central Nervous System or spinal cord, list all the branch or nerves","output":"The tibial nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve, which is derived from the lumbosacral plexus in the lumbar and sacral regions of the spinal cord. Here is the pathway of the tibial nerve back to the central nervous system: 1. The tibial nerve emerges as a branch of the sciatic nerve in the posterior thigh. 2. It descends through the posterior compartment of the leg, giving off branches along the way: - The medial sural cutaneous nerve - The sural nerve - Branches to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg (e.g., gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis posterior) 3. The tibial nerve continues through the leg and eventually reaches the foot. 4. The tibial nerve does not directly connect back to the central nervous system or spinal cord. Instead, it serves as a peripheral nerve that carries sensory and motor information from the lower leg and foot back to the spinal cord via the sciatic nerve. 5. In the spinal cord, the sensory information is transmitted to the brain for processing, while motor commands are sent back from the brain to the lower extremities through the spinal cord to control movement and function."},{"instruction":"Types of volcanoes in point short","output":"Sure, here\'s a brief outline of the main types of volcanoes: 1. **Shield Volcanoes**: Broad, gently sloping sides created by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow long distances. Example: Mauna Loa in Hawaii. 2. **Cinder Cone Volcanoes**: Small, steeply sloped volcanoes built from ash, cinders, and small rocks ejected explosively. Example: Parícutin in Mexico. 3. **Composite Volcanoes (Stratovolcanoes)**: Large, steeply sloped volcanoes built from alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and other volcanic debris. They are known for explosive eruptions. Example: Mount Fuji in Japan. 4. **Lava Domes**: Formed by the slow eruption of viscous lava from a volcano. The lava piles up around the vent, creating a dome shape. Example: Lassen Peak in California. 5. **Submarine Volcanoes**: Volcanoes that form on the ocean floor and are often shield volcanoes. They can form islands when they grow large enough to break the water\'s surface. Example: Loihi Seamount near Hawaii. 6. **Subglacial Volcanoes (Cryovolcanoes)**: Volcanoes that form beneath ice caps and have unique interactions with the ice, sometimes leading to explosive eruptions due to the pressure buildup from trapped gases and steam. Example: Katla in Iceland. 7. **Supervolcanoes**: Not a distinct shape, but refer to volcanoes that can produce extremely large eruptions with the potential to cause devastating climate changes. Example: Yellowstone Caldera in the USA. 8. **Mud Volcanoes**: Not true volcanoes, but formations that expel gases and muddy waters from deep underground, often linked to petroleum reserves. Example: Lusi mud volcano in Indonesia. Each type has unique characteristics in terms of eruption style, frequency, and shape, reflecting the viscosity and composition of the erupting magma, local tectonic settings, and eruption history."},{"instruction":"Drainage pattern point short","output":"Drainage patterns describe the way rivers and their tributaries flow in a particular region, influenced by the terrain, geology, and the amount and pattern of rainfall. Here\'s a brief outline of the main types: 1. **Dendritic**: The most common pattern, resembling the branches of a tree or veins of a leaf. It occurs in regions where the rock type and structure are uniform. 2. **Radial**: Streams radiate outward from a central high point, like a volcanic cone or a dome-shaped mountain. 3. **Centripetal**: The opposite of radial, where streams flow toward a central low point or basin. This pattern is less common. 4. **Trellis**: Develops in regions of alternating resistant and less resistant rock strata. The main rivers flow parallel to the slope, and tributaries join at right angles. 5. **Rectangular**: Characterized by rivers that follow a path of right-angle turns, typically influenced by a faulted and jointed rocky terrain. 6. **Parallel**: Features streams that run parallel to each other, closely spaced and often of similar size, usually on a steep slope. 7. **Deranged**: A chaotic pattern with no clear geometry, often found in areas that have been significantly altered by glaciation or other processes that disrupt the natural flow of water. 8. **Annular**: Features concentric circles or arcs of rivers, typically developing in areas with a domed structure where dipping sedimentary or volcanic rock layers influence the river flow directions. Each pattern provides insights into the underlying geology, topography, and climatic conditions of the area."},{"instruction":"preprocessed_question_var = fn_preprocess_question(question) for predefined_question_var,predefined_answer_var in dict_predefined_answers.items(): if fn_preprocess_question(predefined_question_var) in preprocessed_question_var: return predefined_answer_var porter_stemmer =PorterStemmer() #-------------------------------------- def fn_preprocess_question(question): return \' \'.join([porter_stemmer.stem(word) for word in question.split()]) dict_predefined_answers ={ \\"Who are you\\":\\"I am the SAMS bot, your Virtual Sales Assistant.

The preprocessing step simplifies questions by stemming, but this alone may not be sufficient for accurately matching more complex queries with the appropriate predefined answers. Since the process involves checking if the preprocessed predefined question is in the preprocessed user question, less specific or shorter phrases (like the stemmed version of \\"Hi\\") might inadvertently match a wide array of input questions that contain similar or stemmed remnants of the word or phrase. To correct this issue, you might need to implement a more robust method for matching user questions to predefined answers. One simple enhancement could be to adjust the condition for matching questions and answers to require a more precise or exact match. Alternatively, consider implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can better understand the context and intent behind a user query. Below, I\'ve modified the `fn_preprocess_question` function slightly to lower-case all text (basic normalization step) and added a basic check to ensure more exact matches. This is a simplistic approach and may still not fully solve the issue with out-of-context matches but is a step towards illustrating how you might start to refine your matching logic: ```python from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer # Presumed existing initialization... porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer() # Modified preprocessing function def fn_preprocess_question(question): # Added lowercasing for basic normalization return \' \'.join([porter_stemmer.stem(word).lower() for word in question.split()]) dict_predefined_answers = { # Predefined answers unchanged } # Simulating the question-answer function def get_predefined_answer(question): preprocessed_question_var = fn_preprocess_question(question) for predefined_question_var, predefined_answer_var in dict_predefined_answers.items(): if fn_preprocess_question(predefined_question_var) == preprocessed_question_var: return predefined_answer_var # Consider adding a generic response if no predefined answer matches return \\"I\'m sorry, I don\'t have a specific answer for that. Can you ask something else?\\" ``` This adjustment checks for an exact match rather than part of the preprocessed user question containing the predefined question. However, this simplistic change might limit the capacity to match varied user inputs to the correct predefined answer due to the exact match requirement. Advanced methods could involve leveraging more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as using semantic similarity measures, keyword extraction, or even training a small machine learning model to classify the intent behind the questions more accurately."},{"instruction":"what changes here ,in my and your code","output":"My apologies for any confusion. Let\'s clarify the changes and suggestions regarding the problem in your scenario with handling queries like \\"which\\" or \\"highest\\" mistakenly invoking a response associated with \\"Hi\\" due to the preprocessing and matching logic in your code. # Original Issue: - Your system preprocesses both user questions and predefined questions through stemming and then checks if the stemmed version of any predefined question is a substring of the stemmed user question. - Because \\"Hi\\" is short and, after stemming, its variations or stemmed remnants could accidentally match unrelated questions, leading to unexpected behavior. # Changes & Key Suggestions: 1. **Normalization by Lowercasing**: One elementary yet significant suggestion was to add a lowercasing step to ensure that case differences do not affect the matching process. It\'s a foundational practice in text preprocessing to convert all text to either uppercase or lowercase to maintain consistency. 2. **Exact Match vs. Substring Match**: - In the original code, you used a condition that could trigger a predefined answer if the preprocessed predefined question is anywhere within the preprocessed user question. This is a loose condition that could easily lead to false positives, as observed with \\"Hi\\". - I suggested shifting towards looking for a more exact match rather than a substring match. However, upon reevaluation, this approach (using equality for full string match `==`) could be too strict and might significantly limit the system\'s ability to match user questions to predefined answers unless they are worded exactly the same way as your keys, which diminishes the utility of stemming. # Correcting the Approach Given the limitations of the exact-match approach from my initial suggestion, a more nuanced solution might involve utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to better understand query intent, as mentioned. Here\'s a conceptual overview of how you could improve it: - **Keyword Identification**: Instead of stemming, identify key terms in both user questions and predefined questions. This could involve NLP techniques like named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, or simply using a list of important keywords to watch for. - **Semantic Matching**: Tools like spaCy or even transformers-based models can help in comparing the semantic similarity between the user question and predefined questions, choosing the closest match if above a certain threshold. - **Fallback Option**: Always have a generic response ready for when the system can\'t confidently match a question to an answer, as this improves user experience by acknowledging the question while not providing incorrect or irrelevant information. # Implementation Note The actual implementation of these concepts would require incorporating NLP libraries (like NLTK, spaCy, or transformer models from Hugging Face) and potentially training custom models or heavily customizing the matching logic based on your particular use case and the complexity and variability of the queries you need to handle. This explanation corrects the overly simplistic suggestion of moving to an exact match while providing a path forward for a more robust and user-friendly solution."},{"instruction":"Change the tense form of the modal verb (if necessary) adding the words in brackets. 1.
