Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a portfolio and an ear trumpet. According to architectural historian Edward Hubbard, Douglas's life \\"seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture ... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries\\". His obituary in the Chester Chronicle stated that he \\"lived heart and soul in his profession\\".Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, St Paul's Church, Boughton, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an oratory. He also had a \\"strong sense of national loyalty\\", incorporating statues of Queen Victoria in niches at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester.

Just think about the noise, the smell and all that wild behavior--chewing on whatever they can get their teeth on, or knocking over the trash can. But don't feel sad. There are smaller and less destructive pets to make your dormitory life colorful. Betta fish They make great pets with their big personality and astonishing colors, ranging from bright red, dark blue to lemon yellow. Unlike many fish, most bettas react to their owner's presence and become more active when they are nearby, which is unusual in the fish world. Chinchillas Without bad smell, about the size of a rabbit and with fur so dense that they can't get pests such as fleas , the friendly creature originally from the Andes Mountains in South America makes an ideal indoor pet. Chinchillas are very social animals, so if you only have one, you will become its family. In cold winter days, in a glance at this fury pet in a dorm will bring you a lot of warmth. Land hermit crabs In a society where owners are often asked \\"Are they tasty?\\", land hermit crabs are among the most unlucky animals commonly kept as pets. But they are easy to care for, inexpensive and fascinating to watch. And the fact that they don't cause any allergic reactions makes them perfect for college dormitories. Red-eared sliders If you're interested in a lifelong friend, a red-eared slider makes a wonderful pet. If well cared for, they can live for around 40 years. But there are a couple of things you should know. Red-eared can grow to an adult size of up to 30cm! So you may need a larger tank quickly.

They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed up to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 meters! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had travelled 1,797 kilometers from London! Question: Which of the following is NOT true?

To do this, add 4966*k to both sides of the equation: -4966*k + 4966*k - 821844 = 2438*k + 4966*k which simplifies to: -821844 = 7404*k Step 3: Solve for k.

Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event. He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father. The son, as a grown man seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy.

Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why is the meat of geese considered lean?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given information In the given text, it is mentioned that the flesh of meat geese is dark-colored and high in protein. It also states that geese deposit fat subcutaneously, and this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. Step 2: Connect the key points To answer the question about why the meat of geese is considered lean, it's essential to understand what lean meat typically consists of. Lean meat is generally low in fat content, particularly saturated fat, and high in protein. The provided information states that the flesh of meat geese is high in protein and contains monounsaturated fatty acids as their primary fat source. Step 3: Justify the answer Based on the information given, the meat of geese can be considered lean because it is high in protein and contains a lower amount of saturated fat. The primary fat in geese is monounsaturated fatty acids, which are considered healthier fats compared to saturated fats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the latest Bond movie \\"Skyfall,\\" Daniel Craig's 007 pursues an assassin up a glass skyscraper in the dead of night and meets a glamorous casino host with a troubled past. The action could plausibly have taken place in any of the world's major metropolises but the film makers chose Shanghai and Macau, two of China's most dynamic cities. It reflects the growing importance of China as a market for Hollywood movies and Chinese backdrops, themes and actors are likely to become only more commonplace. But appealing to Chinese audiences is fraught with difficulty as the makers of \\"Skyfall,\\" which has fallen foul of Chinese censors, have discovered. It's understandable (why censors want to remove certain scenes) if a movie contains only a few China scenes and the","output":"content is deemed sensitive or controversial. However, it's crucial for filmmakers to strike a balance between catering to the preferences of Chinese audiences and maintaining the integrity of their artistic vision. As China's box office continues to grow and surpass that of North America, Hollywood studios are becoming more aware of the need to appeal to Chinese moviegoers. The incorporation of Chinese elements, such as locations and actors, has become an increasingly popular tactic. However, this strategy also opens the door to potential conflicts with Chinese authorities who strictly regulate media content in the country. One of the major challenges faced by filmmakers is navigating the delicate subject of censorship. Chinese censors have a reputation for being particularly strict when it comes to depicting their nation and its people in a negative or controversial light. Consequently, filmmakers are often forced to make compromises or even cut entire scenes to appease the censors and avoid being banned from the profitable Chinese market. Moreover, cultural differences can play a significant role in determining the success or failure of a film in China. What might appeal to Western audiences may not always resonate with Chinese moviegoers. As such, filmmakers need to be mindful of these discrepancies and carefully consider how their film's themes, narrative, and characters will be received by both domestic and international audiences. Ultimately, the growing importance of the Chinese market in the global film industry cannot be underestimated and the need to connect with Chinese viewers is becoming increasingly vital. Nevertheless, filmmakers must walk a fine line between embracing the Chinese market and preserving their creative vision. \\"Skyfall\\", despite its troubles with Chinese censors, serves as a valuable lesson for the industry on the complexities of appealing to a rapidly expanding and influential audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda), a down-on-his-luck musician at New York City's Stork Club, is in a money crunch. His wife, Rose (Vera Miles), needs to have her wisdom teeth extracted at a cost of 300, but the couple does not have that much money. Though he has already borrowed against his life insurance policy, he goes to the life insurance company to attempt to take a loan out against Rose's policy. He is immediately recognized by the clerical workers in the store as the man who had twice held up the insurance office. They inform the police, and he is taken to the 110th Precinct by detectives. Without being told why, Manny is instructed to walk in and out of a liquor store and delicatessen, both scenes of a robbery earlier that year. He is then asked by police to give a handwriting sample, writing the words from the stick-up note at the insurance company. Manny misspells the word \\"drawer\\" as \\"draw\\"âthe same spelling mistake the robber made in the note. After being picked out of a police lineup by the women from the insurance company, he is then arrested and charged with robbery, and his family finds out that he will be in court on the following morning. Attorney Frank O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) sets out to prove that Manny cannot possibly be the right man: at the time of the first hold-up he was on vacation with his family, and at the time of the second his jaw was so swollen that witnesses would certainly have noticed. Manny and Rose look for three people who saw Manny at the vacation hotel, but two have died and the third cannot be found. All this devastates Rose, whose resulting depression forces her to be hospitalized.

Answer based on context: Coming off a bad loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Jaguars looked to rebound against their division rival Indianapolis Colts. Indianapolis scored on its first possession as running back Joseph Addai ran it in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 Colts. After two touchdown runs by David Garrard and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars took the lead in the second quarter, 14-7. Their lead didn't last very long as quarterback Peyton Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, tying the game at 14 heading into halftime. The Jaguars regained the lead in the third quarter with Garrard finding tight end Marcedes Lewis for a fifteen-yard touchdown pass. Jacksonville took the lead 21-14. Once again, the Colts responded when Addai scored on a two-yard touchdown run tying the game at 21. With 2:13 left in the game, Garrard completed it to Maurice Jones-Drew for an eight-yard touchdown pass and the Jaguars took a 28-21 lead. That was enough time for 4 time MVP Peyton Manning, however as he hooked up with wide receiver Austin Collie for a one-yard touchdown that appeared as if it would send the game into overtime.

Question: \\"Detroit is NOT in what area of the United States?\\"  Context: \\"Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Detroit is NOT in the Southern area of the United States.

The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read out the facts of the case, including the conviction of Ivory Coast native Rudy Guede for his role in Kercher's murder.  The defense teams asked for several items of evidence to be retested for DNA, and Nencini agreed that a knife found in Sollecito's apartment would be re-examined.

Real Salt Lake sealed an upset win over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Sunday night with a 5-4 penalty victory, after extra-time in the Major League Soccer Cup final that ended with the score at 1-1. Robbie Russell netted the vital spot kick after Real Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando made two saves and MLS Most Valuable Player, and LA Galaxy captain, Langdon Donovan sent his shot sailing over the crossbar. Salt Lake's win at the Qwest Field arena in Seattle, ended David Beckham's bid to claim a third national title in as many different nations, having previously won the English Premier League with Manchester United and La Liga with Spain's Real Madrid. The Galaxy struck first, with midfielder Mike Magee drilling a 41st-minute shot into an open net. His strike came after Beckham passed to Donovan, who set-up Magee at the far post. Seattle: America's soccer city. Real Salt Lake hit back with 25 minutes left when Robbie Findley reacted first after Yuri Movsisyan's attempt on goal was blocked, tying the match and setting up the penalty shootout. Beckham got the Galaxy off to a good start in the shoot out as he scored with confidence, but his team could not follow in the same manner. Jovan Kirovski's shot was blocked by Rimando, but Saunders followed by stopping the effort of Salt Lake captain Kyle Beckerman before Donovan blazed over the crossbar to leave the score 5-4. Galaxy came into the game as  favorites, but flattered to deceive as it was revealed Beckham had played with an injured right ankle. \\"We all want to win titles and personally I'd love to be successful but I think we have been successful this year without winning tonight,\\" Beckham told reporters after the game. \\"We have quietened a few people along the way which is always nice but we couldn't finish it off. \\"I wouldn't say it's tougher to lose on penalties but it's Russian roulette, that's just the way it is.

The answer to the question: What song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics? is inside the article: The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".

Remove the steel from the quenching medium when it stops bubbling.","output":"Title: The Art of Quenching Steel: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Optimal Hardness and Material Properties Introduction Quenching is an essential process in the heat treatment of steel and various other metallic alloys. It is a method used to quickly cool down a heated material, typically using water or oil, in order to achieve desirable mechanical properties such as hardness, ductility, and tensile strength. This rapid cooling process is crucial in attaining martensitic transformation – a phenomenon responsible for the enhanced strength and hardness in steel. In this article, we will delve into the step-by-step process of quenching steel using a heat-safe container filled with water or oil, as well as discuss some important factors to consider for optimal results. Step 1: Preparing the Heat-Safe Container and Quenching Medium The first step in the quenching process is selecting an appropriate heat-safe container that is large enough to submerge your steel. Common choices for containers include steel buckets, metal troughs, or even a sizeable cooking pot. It is important to choose a container made from a material that can withstand high temperatures without cracking or melting, as the steel will be extremely hot when it is quenched. Next, you need to choose a suitable quenching medium. Water and oil are the most popular choices, although some specialized applications may require other cooling materials. Water is often chosen for its excellent heat absorption capacity, but it can cause issues like steam bubbles or cracking in certain steel alloys. Oil, on the other hand, provides a slower and more controlled cooling process, which can significantly reduce the risk of cracking or distortion. Make sure the container is filled with an adequate amount of quenching medium to completely submerge the steel. Step 2: Heating the Steel Before you begin the quenching process, it is crucial to ensure that your steel is heated to the appropriate temperature. This is determined by the specific steel alloy being used, the desired mechanical properties, and the size and shape of the component. Generally, the steel should be heated to a temperature within the range of 1500°F to 1900°F (815°C to 1040°C), known as the \\"austenitizing temperature\\". During the heating process, it is important to heat the steel evenly and monitor the temperature closely. This can be done by using a furnace, an oxy-acetylene torch, or in some cases, a forge. The heating method employed will depend on the size of the steel piece and the resources available. Step 3: Quenching the Steel Once the steel has reached its austenitizing temperature, it is time to quench it in the prepared container with water or oil. Take necessary precautions, such as wearing heat-resistant gloves and safety goggles, to avoid any injuries during this procedure. Carefully submerge the heated steel into the quenching medium, making sure it is fully immersed to ensure uniform cooling. The steel will begin to react with the quenching medium, causing it to bubble and produce vapors. Gently move the steel within the container for even cooling and to prevent any vapor pockets from forming, which can impact the quenching process. Step 4: Removing the Steel from the Quenching Medium Once the steel has stopped bubbling, which indicates that it has been effectively cooled, gently remove it from the quenching medium. Carefully inspect the steel for any signs of distortion or cracking, which could have occurred during the quenching process. If any issues are observed, it is essential to identify the cause and modify the quenching process accordingly. Step 5: Tempering the Steel At this point, the steel is in a harder but more brittle state. To achieve the desired balance of hardness and ductility, tempering is a crucial next step. The tempering process involves heating the steel to a lower temperature than the austenitizing temperature, and then allowing it to cool slowly. This results in a more ductile and less brittle material – a characteristic ideal for various engineering and manufacturing applications. Conclusion Quenching steel is an essential technique in the heat treatment process, enabling manufacturers to achieve desired mechanical properties in their steel components. The choice of quenching medium, heating methods, and attention to detail plays a significant role in the success of the process, ultimately impacting the material's hardness, ductility, and other essential properties. By following this step-by-step guide, you can ensure an efficient and successful quenching process, producing steel components with optimal material characteristics for a wide range of applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge  from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer  pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did.

(CNN) -- Mark McGwire deserves a ban from baseball more than any sympathy.  It is sad to hear his quavery confession of a career filled with steroids, his sorrow over the pain it caused his family and fans, his revelation of a life of lies that burned inside him like a hidden disease and consumed the game he loved.  But for those of us who also love baseball, the damage he did was too deep and his further threat to the integrity of the game is too great to justify his return.  McGwire's entire playing career is indelibly stained and his judgment is not to be trusted. What else are we to make of a man who cheated and didn't come clean for 20 years? Can he be trusted to coach other players who may be using steroids? Is he fit for any job that is also a test of character and personal standards? Baseball should bar him from coaching and never again allow his name on a Hall of Fame ballot.  St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, McGwire's longtime apologist, is leading the charge to rehabilitate him in his new role as the Cardinals' batting coach, saying Monday's admission and expression of regret is worthy of respect.  This from a manager who either closed his eyes to drug use on his teams, didn't know what he should have known, or kept conspiratorially silent about it through all the years with McGwire on the Oakland Athletics (along with Jose Canseco) and on the Cards.  1. Which sport does Mark McGwire play? 2. What drugs did he use? 3. Is he sad about that? 4. Whom did he cause pain? 5. Who else? 6. How long was it until he confessed? 7.

Summarize the following: Car seats are tested for their performance in crashes, and various safety organizations publish the results. These organizations and safety ratings vary by country; Australia, for example, has some of the strictest safety ratings for car seats. In Canada, Transport Canada publishes information about car seats. In the United States, consult Consumer Reports or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for information about safety ratings. Additional information can also be found at the National Child Passenger Safety Board’s website. If a particular car seat has defects in it, its manufacturer may have issued a recall. The car seat would then be returned to the manufacturer for a new seat or a refund. When you are looking into different car seats and brands, check to see if there have been any recalls on the particular car seat model or the brand itself. Search online for “car seat recall” to find the most up-to-date information. All car seats have basic features that will ensure a solid level of safety and comfort for your infant. Many car seats do, however, have additional features. These might include additional side-impact cushioning, extra padding all around the seat, or an anti-rebound bar at the foot of the car seat. At the end of a major crash, during the rebound, the car seat might bounce up and hit the seat in front of it. The anti-rebound bar, available in newer seats, is intended to minimize the impact that the car seat will take. There should be one strap per limb: one for each upper arm and one for each thigh, as well as one for the area between the child's legs. There are alternative restraint systems, such as plastic shields and T-bar restraints, but the strap system is more customizable, which can make the seat more comfortable for your child’s size. Starting in 2002, all infant car seats were required to be compatible with the LATCH system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children. The LATCH system allows infant car seats to attach directly into a car seat rather than being held in place by the seatbelt. Hooking up directly into a car seat will maximize the safety of your child in your vehicle. The LATCH system is compatible with or known by different names in other countries. In Canada, the system is called the Universal Attachment System (UAS). In Europe, the system is called ISOFIX, and ISOFIX compatible in Australia. As car seats are used, their materials deteriorate and can become less reliable. Car seat manufacturers imprint their seats with expiration dates, typically 6 years after the date of manufacture. This date can usually be found imprinted into the plastic on the back or bottom of a car seat. Ensure that the car seat has not been in a crash; this might compromise the integrity of the seat and its materials. If the seat is older than 6 years, it is not recommended for use. Summary:","output":"Car seats are tested for crash performance with results published by various safety organizations, which differ by country.

Check for recalls on car seat models on the National Child Passenger Safety Board's website. Car seats have basic safety features and may also have additional features such as side-impact cushioning or anti-rebound bars.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In tough economic times, school counselors   don't just wait for students to come to their offices in search of college brochures, health pamphlets or other help. These days, they are looking for at-risk kids to prevent personal or academic troubles before they arise. Nowadays, students and families need the guidance more than ever.  Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help.  Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups   for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\"  At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred   to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years.

Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores.

A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs.

This tutelage leads the reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to Reap (Roxy), abusing immortality for financial gain (Mason, played by Callum Blue), letting a soul wander, instead of showing him \\"his lights\\" (Daisy, now played by Sarah Wynter), and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.[2] Georgia \\"George\\" Lass (Ellen Muth), the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time (a temp agency) after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late. The employee quits and later sues for harassment. George ends up admitting her identity to her sister Reggie (Britt McKillip). George finds herself reminiscing with Reggie, helping her prepare for the death of her boyfriend Hudson (Jordan Hudyma).[2] Her fellow reapers confront Kane and learned that he had realized (and didn't care) that the \\"pebbles\\" of their misdeeds would cause \\"waves\\" of misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his style of management, they find themselves trying to figure out how exactly a fellow reaper can be killed as they shoot, drown, and finally dismember and cremate Kane. His ashes are then shot into orbit along with those of Murray, the cat belonging to George's boss Delores.[2] At the launch, Delores tells George that the employee who had sued her for harassment had done so at several of the employee's previous jobs, and George is reinstated, now with a corner office.

Recurrent non-random genomic alterations are the hallmarks of cancer and the characterization of these imbalances is critical to our understanding of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.', 'We performed array-comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH) on cDNA microarrays containing 42,000 elements in neuroblastoma (NB). We found that only two chromosomes (2p and 12q) had gene amplifications and all were in the MYCN amplified samples. There were 6 independent non-contiguous amplicons (10.4-69.4 Mb) on chromosome 2, and the largest contiguous region was 1.7 Mb bounded by NAG and an EST (clone: 757451); the smallest region was 27 Kb including an EST (clone: 241343), NCYM, and MYCN. Using a probabilistic approach to identify single copy number changes, we systemically investigated the genomic alterations occurring in Stage 1 and Stage 4 NBs with and without MYCN amplification (stage 1-, 4-, and 4+). We have not found genomic alterations universally present in all (100%) three subgroups of NBs. However we identified both common and unique patterns of genomic imbalance in NB including gain of 7q32, 17q21, 17q23-24 and loss of 3p21 were common to all three categories. Finally we confirm that the most frequent specific changes in Stage 4+ tumors were the loss of 1p36 with gain of 2p24-25 and they had fewer genomic alterations compared to either stage 1 or 4-, indicating that for this subgroup of poor risk NB requires a smaller number of genomic changes are required to develop the malignant phenotype.

The activity of floating down a river on inter-tubes is generally recognized as a recreational activity undertaken for enjoyment and leisure. However, it is important to consider various aspects and motivations behind Taylor's decision to partake in this activity to provide a more comprehensive response. 1. Social Interaction: Participating in group activities with friends is a way to strengthen and maintain relationships. By engaging in a shared experience like river-floating, Taylor can create lasting memories and bond with their friends. 2. Adventure and thrill-seeking: Floating down a river on inter-tubes can offer a sense of adventure and excitement. The activity may involve navigating through rapids or simply drifting along calm waters. Either way, it can provide an adrenaline rush and satisfy thrill-seeking desires. 3. Relaxation: Taking time away from daily routines and responsibilities can be essential for mental health and well-being. Floating down a river on inter-tubes allows Taylor to relax, unwind, and recharge, alleviating stress in the process. 4.

Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, I need to think step-by-step and justify the steps: 1.

Article: Your brain isn't a muscle, but you can treat it like one Many people focus on physical fitness, but few know that brain fitness is also something you can work on. In fact, you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs-and the results can be positive and empowering. To improve your brain, you can't simply repeat the same exercises over and over. Just as lifting a two-pound weight will stop challenging you, so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku. Once you master easy exercises, you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain-like your muscles-to a new level. The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood. Since studies have shown just the opposite, millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training. The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco-based Lumosity. Lumosity's scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun,effective online brain training program that measures, tracks, and adapts to your progress, so you'll always be challenged. Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study, a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed, mental flexibility, and working memory tasks. On average, those who trained improved on tests of these abilities, compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity.

The politics of North Korea takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, \\"Juche\\", a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung. The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? North Korea is a satellite state of the United States Select from the following. (I) Yes (II) It's impossible to say (III) No","output":"(III) No The given sentence, \\"North Korea is a satellite state of the United States,\\" is not true based on the information provided in the paragraph. According to the paragraph, the politics of North Korea is governed by the Juche ideology, which emphasizes self-reliance and a strong, independent state as the means of achieving true socialism. A satellite state, on the other hand, typically refers to a country that is formally independent but is heavily influenced or controlled by another, more powerful state. This concept contradicts the core values of the Juche ideology, as it would involve reliance on the United States and undermine North Korea's pursuit of independence and self-reliance. Moreover, historically, North Korea has had an antagonistic relationship with the United States, and the two countries have significant ideological differences. North Korea is a one-party socialist state with a centrally planned economy, while the United States is a federal republic with a capitalist, market-oriented economic system. The two nations have been involved in several political conflicts and diplomatic crises, most notably during the Korean War and the ongoing issues regarding North Korea's nuclear program.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Question: \\"Why was Shiva Nazar Ahari put in prison?\\" Answer: \\"Alleged adultery\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is incorrect. Shiva Nazar Ahari was put in prison for charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God,\\" which is a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. She is a prominent young female defender of human rights and her imprisonment is part of Iran's coordinated strategy against the women's movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: The one-handed backhand is a beautiful shot but has become less popular in recent years. However, it is still used by many players such as Roger Federer as a powerful weapon in matches. Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net. This is the first step of the one-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. Start from the ready position and take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot. As you step forward turn your body and shoulders sideways so that they are now perpendicular to the net.  All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Choose your grip based on the execution you want to achieve. The one-handed backhand will usually use an Eastern backhand grip to create topspin on the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders.  To achieve the Eastern backhand grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. An alternative grip includes the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand grip. This grip is for use by stronger, more advanced players and is good for hitting high balls but not good for hitting low balls. Another alternative grip is the Continental grip, which holds the racket at a 45 degree angle and is good for hitting slices. The Semi-Western backhand grip is a rare backhand grip that is good for hitting heavy topspin but bad for hitting flat shots and slices. The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways. Let your racket drop down as you straighten your hitting arm. At the same time step into the shot with your front foot. The drop of your racket creates the topspin on the tennis ball and is very important to your one-handed backhand.  This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket as you complete this step. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height. Let go of the racket with your non-hitting hand after your racket is down and your hitting arm is completely straight. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. You should make contact in front of your body.  Make sure your arm and the racket swing from the shoulder as a unit. This way your arm position relative to the racket does not change as you swing. The racket should come as low as your knee right before you make contact with the tennis ball. This will produce the topspin that you want on your backhand. Your upper body will rotate slightly back towards the net as you make your swing. Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact with the ball. Make sure contact is made in front of your body to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Keep the relationship between your arm and the tennis racket the same as you follow through. Continue lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, keeping your arm position the same. The relationship between your arm and racket should not change until your hand is at the same level as your head. Your non-hitting arm should extend all the way back and behind you. This arm controls how much your shoulders and upper body rotate as you follow through. Letting your non-hitting arm extend behind you limits the rotation of your upper body, helping you recover faster and stay balanced during your shot.","output":"The one-handed backhand is a powerful yet less common shot in tennis today, used effectively by players like Roger Federer.

Your weight should be on your back foot, enabling power and pace when hitting the shot. 3.

Use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip and hold the racket with your dominant hand, ideally simultaneously with the pivot and shoulder turn. 4. Continue rotating your shoulders and moving your arms until the racket is all the way back and your shoulders are entirely sideways. Straighten your hitting arm while dropping the racket and stepping into the shot with your front foot. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket and your eyes focused on the ball. 5. Release the racket with your non-hitting hand once your hitting arm is straight, and swing your arm and racket to the contact point with the ball, which should be in front of your body. Swing your arm and racket together as a unit to maintain their relative position, and bring the racket as low as your knee before contact with the ball to generate topspin. 6. Slightly rotate your upper body back towards the net as you swing, focusing on the ball as you hit it. Contact should be made in front of your body to maximize power and topspin. 7. Maintain the relationship between your arm and racket as you follow through, lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders throughout the shot.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  and the situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Answer the following question: Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B? Answer:","output":"The fruits in bowl A had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup. This is because the instructor was demonstrating the process of making glace fruit (also known as candied or crystallized fruit) and kept the prepared glace fruits in bowl A.

Bowl B, on the other hand, was used to hold non-glace fruits for comparison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Movie title: Police Story 4: First Strike Context: Whilst working for the CIA, Chan Ka-kui (Jackie Chan) is assigned to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case. He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information, Ka-kui calls for backup and she is later arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Ka-kui follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Ka-kui finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Ka-kui goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill and Ka-kui suspects the criminal will show up soon. Unknown to Ka-kui, Tsui is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. While following Annie, Ka-kui gets held up by Tsui, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. Ka-kui, after realizing he has been used by Gregor, decides to return home, but two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7. He attempts to clear his name by going to see Annie at the memorial hall, but he is (unsurprisingly) unwelcome, having to fight bodyguards and Tsui has to eventually rescue him.

I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment. I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology. The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you \\"have walked a mile in their shoes\\" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry.

What is the last name of person that designed a cenotaph that is in front of the building that was purchased by the Texas Legislature in the 20th century?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time.  Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three.  From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian.  The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance.   Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation.  Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own.  Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans.  In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world.  In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films. Most English-language treatments reflect the perspectives of the Anglos and are centered primarily on the battle of the Alamo.

Attorney-General George Brandis said the laws would apply in \\"very limited circumstances\\". At least 90 Australians are believed to be fighting with militant groups such as the so-called Islamic State. About half of them are thought to be dual nationals. Australia is increasingly concerned about the impact on its domestic security of those who support or fight with militants in the Middle East. Mr Brandis said on Friday: \\"Dual nationals who engage in terrorism are betraying their allegiance to this country and do not deserve to be Australian citizens,\\" he said. He told the senate it was \\"a significant piece of legislation which will enhance Australia's counterterrorism architecture\\". The laws do not allow for anyone to be left stateless. The government had amended the bill, introduced to the lower house in June, to increase its chances of surviving an expected challenge in the Australian High Court. Australian Constitutional experts had said the bill was flawed, according to ABC. But Mr Brandis said the legislation was \\"as strong as we can make it from a constitutional point of view\\". An independent senator and the Greens party had previously suggested the move could further expose Australians to attacks overseas. \\"Do we just give up, revoke their citizenship and then let them free range with their sick, twisted minds to do damage to Australians and to other innocents abroad?\\" said independent senator Nick Xenophon. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said it would be better to jail militants in Australia. \\"Ultimately we think the safest place for Australian citizens who have been convicted of violent acts, who are indeed criminals, is in custody here in Australia, not roaming the international stage,\\" he said.

The main aim of the legislation is to enhance Australia's counterterrorism efforts and address the threat posed by individuals who support or fight with militant groups in the Middle East.

Background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.  Paragraph: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","output":"The person had a lower core temperature during experiment B.  Reasoning: In experiment B, the person consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during the two hours in the -30 degrees weather. The alcohol in the hard liquor caused his blood vessels to dilate and stimulated nerve endings near his skin's surface with warm blood, creating a sensation of warmth. However, this dilation of blood vessels actually made it easier for his body to lose heat to the cold external environment, resulting in a lower core body temperature during experiment B compared to experiment A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its beautiful language, refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh, the dialogs, and above all, two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years. Of all these films I've only seen one, 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark, brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class, he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic, vibrant, the force of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of Thornfield.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows.

Patient A has been suffering from hepatitis B all his life; patient B is recovering from hepatitis B on his own; and patient C doesn't have hepatitis B. Keith would now compare the symptoms of these patients.  Which patient would more likely see yellowing of the skin, patient A or patient C?","output":"Patient A would be more likely to experience yellowing of the skin compared to patient C. This is because patient A is suffering from hepatitis B, a viral infection that affects the liver. One of the common symptoms of hepatitis B is jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and eyes due to a buildup of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced as a waste product of the breakdown of red blood cells. The liver plays a crucial role in processing bilirubin and excreting it from the body. When the liver is affected by hepatitis B, its ability to perform this function might be compromised, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the bloodstream and causing the skin and eyes to take on a yellowish hue. On the other hand, patient C does not have hepatitis B, meaning their liver should be functioning normally and not have any issues with breaking down bilirubin effectively. As a result, it is unlikely that patient C would experience yellowing of the skin. It should be noted that while patient B is recovering from hepatitis B, they might still be at risk of experiencing symptoms like jaundice, although to a lesser extent as the infection clears. The extent of liver damage or any lingering symptoms would depend on the individual patient and the severity of the infection. In summary, patient A, who is suffering from hepatitis B, is more likely to see yellowing of the skin compared to patient C because of the liver's compromised ability to process bilirubin."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mnemosyne, a Japanese anime series, consists of 6 episodes. It initially aired between February 3, 2008, and July 6, 2008. The series presents a supernatural and horror-themed storyline, revolving around the central character Rin and her encounters with various supernatural beings. The episodes were compiled into an OVA (Original Video Animation) format and are typically around 45 minutes in length each, which is longer than the standard runtime of most regular anime episodes. This was due to the series being released as direct-to-video, instead of the traditional TV broadcast format.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Answer this question please: Which squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers, lighter or darker? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it is likely that squirrels with lighter coats would reproduce in smaller numbers. Here's a step-by-step rationale: 1. The city where Mike lives has a cold environment and less predator-prey interaction. 2. Darker coats are more suitable for this type of environment since they provide better insulation in cold temperatures. 3. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that allow them to adapt better to their environment tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. 4. In this case, squirrels with darker coats are better adapted to the cold environment, meaning they would have a higher likelihood of survival and reproduction. 5.

No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The Handmaid's Tale debuts as ballet in Winnipeg The Handmaid's Tale, one of Margaret Atwood's most famous novels, emerges in a brand new form tonight in Winnipeg with the debut of a dance production by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. Adapting Atwood's classic novel was a longtime dream of Royal Winnipeg Ballet artistic director André Lewis and American choreographer Lila York: the pair first began discussing the project about a decade ago. \\"It's a world premiere. That means [it's] never been done, so there's incredible tension, incredible uplift at the same time backstage because we're putting it all together,\\" Lewis said Tuesday. \\"Curtain time is a tough deadline and you got to be ready by then, so everything is happening and it's exciting. That's what you live for as an artistic director, is to see the moment where it comes on stage.\\" On Wednesday night, the work — featuring the music of James MacMillan — will open the RWB's 2013-14 season. Atwood is slated to attend the opening. Published in 1985 and winner of the Governor General's Literary Award, as well as other literary honours, The Handmaid's Tale has previously been adapted for film and as an opera. Atwood's dystopian tale chronicles a future in which a powerful totalitarian regime has taken over and brutally reigns according to militaristic, selectively religious and ultra-conservative beliefs. The story follows Offred, a member of a concubine-like class of women who live solely as reproductive vessels for the society's leaders. The RWB production stars principal dancer Amanda Green as Offred and soloist Alexander Gamayunov as the Commander, the man with whom she is paired. \\"The language of ballet is a physical language. I mean, it can capture emotion and translate them or transport them to the audience in ways that no other art form can do…. It says it differently, and it can say it extremely powerfully,\\" Lewis said. \\"When you see it done physically with dancers, the incredible athleticism and artistry of dancers, it's very poignant. So certainly what I have seen of the run … we did this last week in our studio, it's very strong.\\" The Handmaid's Tale has its world premiere tonight in Winnipeg and will continue with evening performances through Saturday and a matinee for students on Sunday.","output":"The Handmaid's Tale is a famous book by Margaret Atwood.

Step 1: Analyze the context from \\"After the fire a still small voice. -- 1 Kings 19:12\\" This verse is from the Bible, specifically the Old Testament. In this context, the word \\"voice\\" is used to describe the way in which God communicates with the prophet Elijah. The still small voice symbolizes the gentle, delicate, and intimate nature of God's communication with humans as opposed to the loud and destructive elements such as wind, earthquake, and fire mentioned earlier in the passage. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"The voice of the law\\" This expression is a metaphorical way to describe the authority and presence of the law. Here, \\"voice\\" represents the principles, rules, and regulations established by society and enforced by a legal system. In this context, the \\"voice\\" of the law refers to the power of legal authorities to communicate and enforce justice. Step 3: Compare and evaluate the meanings In \\"After the fire a still small voice,\\" the word \\"voice\\" refers to a delicate, intimate form of communication from God. In contrast, in \\"The voice of the law,\\" it refers to the authoritative, regulatory, and forceful nature of the law's principles and rules. Conclusion: The word \\"voice\\" does not mean the same thing in these two expressions. In the first example from 1 Kings 19:12, it represents a gentle communication from God, while in the second example, it denotes the authoritative and regulatory nature of the law.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Martin Robinson. Strife: Michael O'Leary's Ryanair has revealed its first drop in profits for five years but maintains their customer service is improving. Ryanair has suffered its first fall in annual profits for five years but maintains its much-maligned customer service is improving 'rapidly'. The budget airline has today revealed its post-tax profits were eight per cent lower at £426.5million (523million euros) to the end of March 2014 - down around £37million on a year earlier. The slide came despite boss Michael O'Leary's promise that the company would 'stop unnecessarily. p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. Today the chief executive described the results as disappointing but said efforts. since September to reinvent Ryanair's image and reputation helped. passenger traffic rise four per cent in the second half of the year. After years of growth the budget airline was forced to issue an unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months. O'Leary also decided to offer a more 'sophisticated' experience of passengers, including ending the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5. As part of ending the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture, he also promised strict hand-luggage. restrictions would be relaxed. He also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine. mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often. results in a £70 charge to reprint them. Decline: The budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers 'like the enemy' - was recently forced to issue its second profits warning in a year ahead of these disappointing results. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a. reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for. almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary. growth. . The. airline, which operates more than 1,600 routes from 68 bases expects to fly 84.6 million passengers in the next year. Overall,. they are predicting a recovery in profits for the current year to. between £473 million and £505.6million. Over the next five years, the airline plans to grow to more. than 110 million customers a year, it said. Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. But in the past 12 months, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways. Over the autumn a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon. was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer. session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many. customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with. user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired. British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The. Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more. accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still. love me.'","output":"Ryanair, a big airline company, had its profits go down for the first time in five years. Profits are the money a company makes after paying for everything it needs. However, the boss of the company, Michael O'Leary, said they are making their customer service better. Customer service means how a company treats and helps its customers. Ryanair is making changes, like letting people choose where to sit on the plane and being nicer when customers make mistakes. They think their profits will go up again this year, and they plan to have even more customers in the future."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a paragraph, a question and some answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", etc.) You need to list all the correct answer options with their associated letters (e.g. \\"A\\" can be a valid answer).

The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. To restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session.

White county to the east experienced some rain but was sheltered from this phenomenon because of the mountain range.  But I can use this background: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes.

The Indiana mother who - along with her boyfriend - overdosed on heroin in a McDonald's play area they were at with their children was sentenced Monday to six months behind bars. Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, and boyfriend Robert Palmer, 37, was were arrested march after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults. Jeffers was sentenced to six months in jail, with 90 days suspended and given credit for 44 days served only one week after Palmer received a similar punishment, according to WXIX. Jailed: Tamica Jeffers, 33, stands Monday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court with her attorney John Waggal, left, as she is sentenced to six months in jail. Robert Paul Palmer, 37, and Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were arrested last month after shooting up at an Ohio McDonald's. Both have been sentenced to 6 months in jail. Authorities said Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They eventually recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin. Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy they had brought to the play area. Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life. 'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing. Prosecutors said in court he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. He will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail, but it is not known if he had the last half of his sentence suspended similar to Jeffers'. Multiple MailOnline attempts to reach local authorities for clarification were not successful. After the overdoses, the McDonald's franchise owner and operator in suburban Green Township said he was proud that the restaurant crew and its customers took quick action to respond to the emergency and call 911 for medical help for the couple.

We fail to have calls screened by a skillful secretary or assistant, or we leave our door open, actually assuring constant interruptions.

Time is constant that cannot be changed. The clock cannot be slowed down or speeded up. Thus we cannot manage time itself. We can only manage our activities with respect to time. The same skills are needed as those used in managing others--the abilities to plan, organize, delegate, direct, and control. Time management is simply self-management. It is impossible to be effective in any position without controlling one's time effectively. Successful time management does not mean working harder, but working smarter.

Movie title: Too Late for Tears Movie plot: Don DeFore and Lizabeth Scott Jane and Alan Palmer (Scott and Kennedy) are driving to a party in the Hollywood Hills one evening when someone in another car throws a suitcase into the back seat of their convertible. They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car for a short time but get away. Back at their upper-middle-class Hollywood apartment, they examine the cash. Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her in the evening at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she and Alan will be taking a boat ride. Jane has planned to kill her husband Alan in the boat but is stopped by a pang of guilt and begs him to take her to shore, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan wants to continue with the boat ride. Hoping to find cigarettes, he picks up her bag and his own gun falls out. The startled look on his face tells Jane he knows straight off what she had in mind, she grabs the gun, they struggle and she shoots, killing him. When Danny sees the body he fears getting involved in a murder, but Jane threatens to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her. As she planned...","output":"Based on the movie plot provided for \\"Too Late for Tears,\\" it seems that Jane plans to kill two individuals: Danny and her husband, Alan.

Do I expect algorithms and Big Oh complexity questions for a firmware job? In companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. what is the highest position where programming is still a big part of one's job? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To answer your first question, preparing for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google involves several steps, including acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge, polishing your problem-solving abilities, and having a strong understanding of algorithms and Big Oh complexity. Although the focus may lie more on embedded systems, you should expect questions related to algorithms and Big Oh complexity during the interview process. Here are the steps to prepare for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google: 1. Acquire the necessary skills and knowledge:    - Gain proficiency in embedded languages like C, C++, Python, and Assembly.    - Learn about embedded systems, microcontrollers, memory management, and sensor interfacing.    - Understand low-power design principles, real-time operation systems (RTOS), and debugging techniques.    - Get familiar with networking protocols, communication interfaces, and scripting languages.    - Gain exposure to hardware schematics and datasheets for component selection and integration. 2. Open-source contributions and personal projects:    - Contribute to open-source projects related to embedded systems or firmware.    - Work on personal projects and create a portfolio to showcase your skills during the interview process. 3. Algorithm and data structure knowledge:    - Google may include questions related to algorithms and Big Oh complexity in the interview. Therefore, study common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. 4. Prepare for behavioral questions:    - Google emphasizes cultural fit and values technical individuals who can work collaboratively. Familiarize yourself with the company culture and values, and be prepared to share examples of how you have demonstrated those qualities in your past experiences. 5. Networking:    - Connect with professionals working in the industry to gain insights into the job's requirements and keep up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. 6. Practice interview questions:    - Research typical embedded engineer interview questions and practice answering them. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Glassdoor can be beneficial for this purpose. Regarding your second question, in large companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon, the highest position where programming is still a significant part of one's job usually lies within the senior software engineer or principal engineer levels. These engineers are responsible for designing, implementing, and enhancing complex software systems while maintaining their hands-on coding and reviews. Although these roles may involve management and leadership responsibilities, they continue to play a vital role in technical decision-making and collaborating with the teams on core development tasks. Lastly, the two questions you posed are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is about preparing for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google and whether to expect Big Oh complexity questions. In contrast, the second question is about the highest position in large companies where programming remains a significant part of the job. They are separate concepts that focus on unique aspects of the technology industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

But that's where the similarities end. The film stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara as the couple - we never learn their names - at the heart of this poetic meditation on grief, memory, time and existence. When Affleck's character dies in a car accident his ghost returns home to console his grieving partner. Ahead of its release in the UK, we talked to director David Lowery about how he made his film so haunting. \\"I've always loved that image,\\" says Lowery, whose previous films include Ain't Them Bodies Saints - also with Affleck and Mara - and Disney's Pete's Dragon. \\"On our phones the emoji for ghost is a person in a sheet.  We understand that to mean a soul who is not able to move on.  It's a very heavy concept represented by the most child-like image. \\"At one point I had the idea of making a straightforward horror film like Poltergeist, but with the ghost represented by a guy in a sheet. But now I've used it in this movie so I can't do that any more.\\" \\"It was trial and error to be honest,\\" he admits. \\"It is a goofy image and we embraced it. There was a version of the movie that had a lot more slapstick, where the ghost was more comical. But as we were shooting it we realised more and more that just didn't work. \\"Even something as simple as the ghost walking from one room to the next had the potential for comedy. It looked silly. \\"We had to figure out a way to make it not funny. A lot of it was the costume design. It was very complex. We shot the ghost at a different frame rate so that the movement felt spookier and more ethereal.\\" The costume, designed and built by Annell Brodeur, incorporated several layers of petticoats and a helmet designed to keep the actor's face aligned with the eyeholes. \\"You think it's going to be an easy concept just to put a sheet over someone's head, but it was so complicated,\\" adds Lowery. \\"When the ghost looks over his shoulder we had to have everybody down on the ground holding the sheet in place so the folds wouldn't move in the wrong direction.\\" The scene which has got everyone talking is where Rooney Mara's grieving character devours a chocolate pie in a static shot lasting several minutes. \\"I knew that I wanted there to be a moment where you feel her grief that was off the beaten path,\\" says Lowery. \\"We have a scene of her crying in bed and it would have been easy to do another scene like that.  But I felt there was a better way to do it. \\"I thought about times when I'm upset that I take solace in food. I think a lot of people do.\\" Mara told Lowery before we shot it she'd never eaten pie in her life.  She's also vegan, so it wasn't any old chocolate pie. \\"I knew it was asking a lot of her but she went for it - and it's probably the scene I'm proudest of in my career,\\" says Lowery. \\"It's a scene I knew people would talk about. Everyone goes to this movie knowing Rooney's going to eat a pie.\\" The film opens with the couple arguing about whether to leave their Texas ranch home. Lowery explains it was based on an argument he has with his wife over whether they should move to Los Angeles from their home in Texas. \\"I'm a sentimental person and I like to stay in once place and put down roots. I get very attached to the homes I live in. And she's the opposite, she likes to keep moving. \\"We had an argument that felt like a scene from the movie - I  even said so at the time.  It was only a month or two after that the idea for this film came into being.\\" Lowery turned his idea into a 30-page script within a matter of days. \\"It was very surreal to watch Rooney and Casey act that scene when we filmed it,\\" he recalls. \\"My wife was on set that day and I remember her looking at me and rolling her eyes.\\" Lowery chose to film using an almost square aspect ratio and softened the edges of the frame. \\"I've wanted to employ it for a while and this felt like the perfect opportunity to do it. It felt like an experimental film already,\\" he explains. \\"Adding those vignettes on the corners was a way for me to see the film as an object. It imposes a window on the film, you're always looking though something to the image. \\"It helped me understand the movie better and it also added the slightest hint of nostalgia. It has the look of a slide projector image on a wall.\\" A Ghost Story is out in the UK on 11 August Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The flag of the United States is sometimes burned in protest of the policies of the American government, both within the country and abroad. The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as \`\`symbolic speech.'' However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. And if the flag that was burned was someone else's property (as it was in the Johnson case, as Johnson had stolen the flag from a Texas bank's flagpole), they could be charged with petty larceny (a flag usually sells at retail for less than USD 20), or with destruction of private property, or possibly both. What's the best answer to this question: is it illegal to stand on a flag?","output":"No, it isn't illegal to stand on a flag in the United States. Just like how some people might burn the flag to express their feelings or point of view, some people might stand on it too. This is considered \\"symbolic speech,\\" which means you're using actions instead of words to share your thoughts. The big judges in America, called the Supreme Court, said this is okay because of something important called the First Amendment.  But remember, even if it's not illegal, it might make some people very unhappy because they see the flag as a special symbol of our country. And if the flag you're standing on belongs to someone else and you took it without asking, then you could get in trouble because that's like stealing or breaking something that's not yours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let's solve the given instance: Input list: [-52, -56, 20, -31] 1. Sort the list: [-56, -52, -31, 20] 2. Initialize 'min_difference' to a large value (e.g., infinity): min_difference = infinity 3. Iterate through the sorted list and calculate absolute differences:    - |-56 - (-52)| = 4; min_difference = min(infinity, 4) = 4    - |-52 - (-31)| = 21; min_difference = min(4, 21) = 4    - |-31 - 20| = 51; min_difference = min(4, 51) = 4 4. The iteration is over, so the smallest absolute difference is 4. The output for this instance is 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The 20-foot-long, 700-pound sculpture, created by Indian designer Ayush Kasliwal , was installed on Saturday, a couple of weeks after the restaurant opened in late March. It’s in place over a beverage station next to the wine rack, but it sort of looms over the dining room with its welcoming energy. “Good food is important,” says Bajaj. “Aesthetics and ambiance are equally important, because otherwise you could eat good food at home.” More photos of the stainless-steel-and-fiberglass sculpture are after the jump. Kasliwal's sculpture is 20 feet long and about 6 feet, 6 inches wide.

Transistors are a key component to many different types of electronic devices, including radios. They function to amplify or switch electronic signals and power, allowing for modulation of signal output.  In the context of radios, transistors are essential to enable the transmission and reception of signals, including reaching a base station. For example, in walkie-talkies, truck radios, or ham radios that people might use in field operations, transistors play a crucial role.  It's important to note that the term 'transistor radio' is often used to refer to portable radios that people used before the era of smartphones and internet radios.

Question: Why does the killer disconnect the phone lines? Movie title: Deliria Movie plot: Late at night inside a theater, a troupe of actors are rehearsing a musical about a mass murderer known as the Night Owl. When the show's leading lady Alicia sprains her ankle, she and the wardrobe mistress Betty sneaks out of the rehearsal for medical assistance in which the closest medical facility is a mental hospital. When speaking to the psychiatrist, Betty notices a imprisoned patient who is revealed to be Irving Wallace, a former actor who went insane and committed a killing spree. Unbeknownst to any of them, Wallace killed one of the attendants with a syringe and sneaked out of the asylum, hiding in the back of Betty's car. Once they arrive back at the theater, the director Peter fires Betty for leaving during rehearsal. As she packs her things and gets ready to leave, Betty returns to the car only for Wallace to murder her with a pickaxe. Moments later, Alicia then emerges from the theater upon the discovery of her friend's corpse. Later, police officers arrive to remove the scene and stations two officers in the parking lot to keep an eye on the premises.Meanwhile, the director creates an idea by altering the play's script; he renames the show's antagonist to Irving Wallace instead of an ambiguous killer, and insists that everyone stay the night to begin immediate rehearsals with the new material, resulting one of his actresses Corinne hide the theater's key so nobody can leave. With the promise of additional cash, the group reluctantly agrees. Inside the dressing room, Laurel feels someone's inside and locks the door; she then screams when someone tries opening it and calls the group to her assistance. Peter accuses Brett as the culprit, but he refuses to accept.Unbeknownst to the group, Wallace himself has donned the theater's owl costume. While Alicia keeps searching for the key, Wallace arrives (with Peter thinking it's Brett) for the scene and strangles Corrine before stabbing her. Without the key's whereabouts, the group begins to panic and tries to contract the outside policemen. Wallace then... Answer:","output":"The killer, Irving Wallace, disconnects the phone lines to isolate the people in the theater, making it easier for him to commit the murders without interruption or interference.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.

The shabby, worn-out carpet had seen better days - it was a tired remnant of the bank's past, desperately gasping for a fresh start. The familiar sound of footsteps making their way across the bank's floor buzzed with quiet frustration and dissatisfaction from their loyal clientele. The bank's management, finally succumbing to the increasing patrons' complaints, initiated the process of revitalization. They identified a reputable hardwood supplier, sourced the finest quality planks, and scheduled the renovation to take place after banking hours. The hours passed, and renovations accelerated as planned. The workers carefully pulled up the ratty carpet, exposing the underlying cement floor. The contractors meticulously measured and cut each hardwood plank, acutely aware of the importance of the details in a financial institution. The bank's management watched with cautious optimism, both excited and nervous about the transformation at hand. And then, the morning sun spilled into the bank through the grand windows, illuminating the spectacular transformation. The once dull and grimy space had metamorphosed into an elegant, sophisticated interior. Rich, chocolate-brown hardwood floors stretched throughout the bank, reflecting a warm and welcoming light. As the customers entered the bank that day, they found themselves in a world reborn. Instead of the frayed and stained carpet, they were greeted by pristine hardwood underfoot. The ambiance breathed new life, with the smart and contemporary design inspiring a renewed confidence in the bank's services. The bank employees, invigorated and motivated by their updated workspace, served customers with newfound enthusiasm. The tellers greeted customers with warm smiles, while loan officers shuffled through paperwork with great pride. The clientele responded in kind - the atmosphere was charged with a positive energy where loyalties were strengthened, and connections renewed.

They recognized the unique and endearing charm that accompanied the subtle marks of age. These scrapes and scuffs served as tangible memories, embedding the successes and setbacks of the bank within the very fabric of its foundation. Years later, customers could still walk into the bank, trace their fingers along the grooves and scuffs in the hardwood, and reminisce about the days when the old carpet had dominated their environment. The bank had garnered recognition and admiration for its rich history and dedication to serving its loyal patrons.

As the largest city in the country, Zurich is home to several major Swiss banks, financial institutions, and insurance companies, contributing significantly to the city's economic growth and success. Nestled on the northwestern shore of Lake Zurich, the city comprises a population of approximately 430,000 people, and the metropolitan area covers a vast area of 1,700 km². One of the primary reasons Zurich is considered the financial center of Switzerland is due to the presence and influence of some of the world's leading financial institutions, such as Credit Suisse and UBS, both of which have their headquarters in the city. Additionally, numerous other international banks operate branches and offices in Zurich, making it a global financial hub. Zurich's economy is predominantly driven by the finance and services sectors. This prosperity is reflected in the high standard of living enjoyed by its residents, which consistently ranks among the highest in the world. Zurich has also been acknowledged as one of the world's most liveable cities, partly due to its clean air, efficient public transportation system, and vibrant cultural scene. Besides finance, Zurich is also a significant hub for technological and scientific industries, with numerous multinational corporations, research centers, and innovative start-ups operating within the city. Well-known tech companies, such as Google and IBM, have established their Swiss headquarters in Zurich, further cementing the city's reputation as a leading economic powerhouse. The Swiss Stock Exchange, also known as the SIX Swiss Exchange, has its main trading floor in Zurich, making it a pivotal center for securities trading in Europe. Due to Switzerland's unique political system and strong privacy laws, the country has historically drawn affluent individuals and multinational corporations seeking financial stability, and Zurich has been the primary beneficiary.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria in Real Madrid training ahead of Atletico clash. Competition: Real Madrid are happy to let Di Maria leave after signing Colombian James Rodriguez. With Di Maria's future at the Bernabeu uncertain, both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are showing keen interest in acquiring the talented Argentine winger. Manchester United, managed by Louis van Gaal, are very eager to strengthen their squad after a disappointing season and believe that Di Maria can bring the much-needed quality and creativity to the team. United are expected to face fierce competition from PSG, who have a strong financial backing and are willing to secure a loan deal for Di Maria before committing to a permanent move next year. Additionally, PSG's potential loan deal could also work in their favor as they navigate through the Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. However, Manchester United, known for their financial muscle, are still hoping to lure Di Maria with a lucrative contract offer and the prospect of playing in the English Premier League. While Manchester United are seriously considering the possibility of signing Di Maria, they will need to move quickly and decisively to fend off PSG's pursuit. Meanwhile, Real Madrid seem to be more than willing to part ways with the Argentine star, especially after acquiring Colombia's rising talent, James Rodriguez, who shone at the World Cup and is expected to have a significant impact on the team's performance. Additionally, the funds generated from Di Maria's transfer will help them recover part of the money spent on James Rodriguez. As the transfer window progresses, it remains to be seen which club will ultimately secure the services of Angel Di Maria. However, one thing is certain: both Manchester United and PSG will not shy away from making aggressive moves in a bid to acquire the talented Argentine winger."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: FBI investigates if terror group arranged California killers’ marriage The FBI is investigating whether the online courtship of the future San Bernardino mass murderers was a match made in hell by a terror group — to set in motion the radicalized duo’s evil plan, director James Comey said on Wednesday. Comey told a Senate Judiciary Committee that investigators do not yet know if a group like ISIS hatched the love-and-hate match between jihadists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In response to a question by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether their marriage was “arranged by a terrorist organization, Comey said: “I don’t know the answer to that yet.” “Do you agree with me that if it was arranged by a terrorist operative of an organization that is a game-changer?” Graham said. “It would be a very, very important thing to know,” Comey responded about the possibility that a terror group arranged a marriage and infiltrated the US using the K-1 fiancee visa system. “That’s why we’re working so hard to understand it,” he said. The top G-man also said that Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were radicalized at least two years ago and planned their evil martyrdom scheme long before they were engaged and before she applied for her visa. The couple — who lived in a two-bedroom townhouse with their 6-month-old daughter and Farook’s mother — killed 14 people and wounded 21 during a holiday party Dec. 2 at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. They were killed about four hours later in a shootout with police. The FBI had previously said only that the two had been radicalized for “quite some time.” Malik, who lived most of her life in Saudi Arabia, moved from Pakistan to the US in July 2014. She married Farook on Aug. 16, 2014, in Riverside, Calif. He was born in Chicago in 1987 and raised in Southern California. “San Bernardino involved two killers who were radicalized for quite a long time before their attack,” Comey said about the couple. “Our investigation to date shows that they were radicalized before they started courting or dating each other online, and as early as the end of 2013, were talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in the US,” he said. “We also believe they were inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. We’re working very to understand exactly their association and the source of their inspiration,” he said. “We’re working very, very hard to understand whether they had other plans — either for that day or earlier.” A US government source familiar with the shooting probe said Farook may have been plotting an attack in the US as early as 2011, Reuters reported. Comey also said his agents are “still sorting out” whether ISIS, which declared the duo its “soldiers,” masterminded the San Bernardino attack – but added that his agency still believes they self-radicalized. He confirmed that Malik posted a “bayat,” or pledge of allegiance, to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the day of the attack. “ISIL has embraced them. … So ISIL’s inspiration may well have been part of this,” he said, using another acronym for the group. Under questioning, Comey also said he “doesn’t have reason to believe” that ISIS has already set up terrorist cells in the US. “They are trying to do two things,” he said. “They are trying to motivate people already in the United States to become killers on their behalf. They would very much like to as they aspire to be the leader in the global jihad [and] send people here to conduct attacks. It’s that second piece that we have not seen yet.” He also declined to say what role, if any, encrypted communications played in last week’s massacre. Comey said he remained concerned that terrorists and others were using technology to evade detection. “Increasingly, we are unable to see what they say, which gives them a tremendous advantage,” he said. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Ioway) said Malik may have provided an incorrect address in Pakistan on her visa application to hide her family’s ties to radical Islamists in the Punjab area, the LA Times reported. “This is yet another example of the failure of the screening process for those entering the United States,” said Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Our government apparently didn’t catch the false address in Pakistan she listed on her application or other possible signs that she was radicalized or an operative.” Two government sources told the paper that Malik apparently used the name of a neighborhood or street near her home in Pakistan. But others who have seen the visa application think she might have provided the erroneous information either to avoid getting exposed because of her relatives’ ties to militant groups or because she was confused by the application form, the LA Times reported.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To keep pizza warm when driving the pizza home, OPT: + put the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer.. + turn all of your car's heaters on full blast with windows down..","output":"To determine which solution is better, we will consider factors such as effectiveness and energy efficiency. Step 1: Analyze each option's effectiveness in keeping the pizza warm. Option 1: Putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer - The seat warmer will transmit heat directly to the box, which will then be retained by the pizza, maintaining its warm temperature. Option 2: Turning all of the car's heaters on full blast with windows down - Since the heaters will be blowing hot air into the car and the windows being down will allow for cold air from outside to enter, there will be a mix of both hot and cold air. This might not be as effective in keeping the pizza warm, as the hot air is not in direct contact with the pizza box. Step 2: Evaluate both options' energy efficiency. Option 1: Using the seat heater only consumes energy for heating the seat itself, reducing overall energy usage. Option 2: Blasting the car's heaters at full power with windows down is less efficient, as it creates unnecessary energy waste. Air conditioners usually consume a significant amount of energy, and having the windows down would require the heaters to work even harder to maintain desired temperatures. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer (Option 1) is a better solution to keep the pizza warm during the drive. This option is both more effective in retaining warmth and promotes energy efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7.   Q: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called?   A: OPT: (1). alkalinity (2). alcohol (3). moisture (4). acidity A:","output":"The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. Acidity is a measure of how acidic a solution is, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of acids and bases. When a substance is dissolved in water, it can release hydrogen ions (H+), which contribute to the acidity of the solution. The concentration of these hydrogen ions determines the pH of the solution, which is a numerical value used to express the level of acidity or alkalinity. A neutral substance, such as pure water, has a pH of 7, meaning that the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to that of hydroxide ions (OH-) in the solution. Substances with a pH lower than 7 are considered acidic, and substances with a pH greater than 7 are considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidity and values above 7 indicating alkalinity. The scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole number change in pH represents a tenfold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. For example, a solution with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. In the given options, (1) alkalinity denotes the opposite of acidity and refers to the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution, (2) alcohol is an organic compound characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH), and (3) moisture refers to the presence of water in a substance, particularly as a trace amount.

Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin.

News article: Turkish Jets Strike Kurdish Rebels The Turks contend that at least 150 P.K.K. fighters were killed in the two earlier raids this month, at least one of which was backed up by shelling by ground forces. However, Kurdish leaders say casualties totaled only a handful, including several civilians. Americans officials in Baghdad declined Wednesday to comment on the disparities in casualty counts. An American military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Kevin J. Bergner, said that efforts were being made to get accurate information, a difficult process. “We don’t have forces there that are the arbiters of the ground truth,” General Bergner said. “The military unit conducting the operation is the Turkish forces, and they are, in this case, the arbiters of ground truth.” The United States is in a delicate situation because Turkey is a crucial American ally. But the United States does not want to strain relations with the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq and the Iraqi government, which have objected to the Turkish attacks. The P.K.K., which has sought an autonomous state in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Philip T. Reeker, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, reiterated the American position on the Turkish military operation. “We made clear, of course, that we would be concerned about anything that leads to civilian casualties or destabilization in northern Iraq,” Mr. Reeker said. “So we will continue to watch the situation closely. And the U.S., Iraq and Turkey continue to have common interests in seeing that the activities of the P.K.K. are ended.” According to Turkish media reports here, the locations attacked by the Turkish military were empty because the rebels retreated deeper into Iraqi territory in anticipation of the raids. “More than the mathematical results, the psychological results are important in this war of propaganda,” said Ali Nihat Ozcan, a political analyst based in Ankara. “There is an improvement in Turkish-American relations, which sends a strong message to the P.K.K. and, on the other hand, pleases and relaxes the Turkish public opinion.” At least three Kurdish political parties have been disbanded by Turkey’s Constitutional Court since the 1990s, mainly on charges of inciting ethnic separation in the country, which has around 15 million Kurds. This year, the public prosecutor brought a motion before the Constitutional Court to disband the Democratic Society Party, accusing it of being the P.K.K.’s political wing. The party’s chairman, Nurettin Demirtas, was recently arrested and is being kept in military jail on charges of forging a medical report to avoid mandatory service with the Turkish military. The P.K.K., which is estimated to have about 3,500 rebels active in the Iraqi mountains, has threatened retaliation against the Turkish military on some Kurdish Web sites. “Maybe during winter an appropriate response is not possible,” a commander in the mountains was quoted as saying by the Firat News Agency on Monday. “But they shouldn’t forget that when leaves turn green, the dreams that the Turkish state has been dreaming will turn into a nightmare.” In Istanbul, seven people were injured Tuesday when a bomb placed in a garbage bin exploded, the police said. No organization has yet claimed responsibility. On Monday, about 7.5 pounds of explosives were found in an abandoned bag in Sisli, a busy Istanbul district.

Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative? The last time I was here was in December.  I thought the food was spectacular.  Today, three months later, not so much.  Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag.  Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy.  There is another local restaurant that does this for me.  Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless.  I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy.  So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous.  The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush.  The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough.  However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices.  Everything was freshly made that has to be said.  The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the \\"sambar?\\"when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food)   It was lentils in a tomato base.  Really good.   The waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady.   I am so disappointed in the food this time around though.  I know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time.  The bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff.  Here today, gone tomorrow.  Today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us.  I don't think I would make another trip out to 24th Avenue and Bell to eat this indian food.

All is going well until Diane receives a phone call from an odd-sounding stranger claiming his name is Evil, who announces on live television that when the clock strikes midnight in each time zone, a \\"Naughty Girl\\" will be \\"punished\\" (murdered), then the killer signs off with a threat claiming that Diane will be the last Naughty Girl to be punished.

Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow?

Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity. In 1972, the coffin has been purchased as part of an estate by two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles. Bobby and Billy open the coffin and become Prince Mamuwalde's first victims. At the funeral home where Bobby McCoy's body is laid, Mamuwalde spies on mourning friends Tina Williams (Vonetta McGee), her sister Michelle (Denise Nicholas), and Michelle's boyfriend, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), a pathologist for the Los Angeles Police Department. Mamuwalde believes Tina is the reincarnation of his deceased wife, Luva. On close investigation of the corpse at the funeral home, Dr. Thomas notices oddities with Bobby McCoy's death that he later concludes to be consistent with vampire folklore. Prince Mamuwalde continues to kill and transform various people he encounters, as Tina begins to fall in love with him. Thomas, his colleague Lt. Peters (Gordon Pinsent), and Michelle follow the trail of murder victims and begin to believe a vampire is responsible. After Thomas digs up Billy's coffin, Billy's corpse rises as a vampire and attacks Thomas, who fends him off and drives a stake through his heart.

Becoming a pilot is a rigorous and challenging process requiring an in-depth understanding of aviation, excellent physical and mental condition, and the ability to handle high-pressure situations. Jason, being keenly aware of the challenges and dedication required to successfully become a pilot, realizes that he still has a long way to go in terms of knowledge and skills. He understands that extra hours of training and practice under the guidance of his experienced tutor, Benjamin, would be highly beneficial for improving his competency. This is because the aviation industry demands a high level of precision, and the need to adhere to strict protocols and standards which leave no room for error. Asking Benjamin for additional hours likely stems from Jason's awareness of his own weaknesses, strengths, and learning progress. In identifying the areas where he needs further assistance, he can focus on refining his skills and acquiring valuable knowledge specific to those areas, ensuring that he becomes a competent and safe pilot. Moreover, working closely with Benjamin allows Jason to receive personalized feedback, tailored guidance, and expert advice, which can considerably enhance his learning experience. This kind of focused, one-on-one training optimizes Jason's development and growth, ultimately improving his chances of becoming a successful pilot. The fact that Benjamin is an experienced tutor is also an important aspect to consider. As an expert in the field, Benjamin brings invaluable insight, advice, and mentorship to Jason's journey and can effectively evaluate his progress and readiness. By seeking extra hours, Jason is not only acknowledging his unpreparedness but also taking proactive responsibility in addressing it. In conclusion, Jason's request for extra training hours from Benjamin (Option 1) is an appropriate choice as it accurately acknowledges and addresses his current unpreparedness. It highlights his commitment to personal development and growth, while also recognizing the critical role that Benjamin plays in his progress towards achieving his dream of becoming a pilot."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Given the context: How would Tracy feel afterwards? Options: [A]. wasteful. [B]. silly. [C]. environmentally conscious. The answer is:","output":"C. environmentally conscious. Tracy's decision to drive less shows their awareness of the environmental impact of their actions, particularly in relation to carbon emissions and fossil fuel usage associated with driving. It demonstrates that they are actively seeking ways to minimize their negative impact on the environment. Choosing to drive less can lead to numerous environmental benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased air pollution, and lower dependence on non-renewable resources.  By taking this step, Tracy's actions align with the values of environmental consciousness, working positively towards a more sustainable future. This shows that they are taking responsibility for their environmental footprint and are likely to be mindful of other aspects of their life that involve their impact on the environment. After making this change, Tracy is expected to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from contributing to the global efforts to fight climate change and protect the environment. They might feel inspired to continue exploring eco-friendly habits and developing an even more sustainable lifestyle.  Moreover, Tracy's decision to drive less can have additional benefits beyond the environmental impact. For example, they might choose to walk, cycle, or use public transport instead of driving. These choices can improve their physical and mental health by incorporating more exercise into their daily routine, reducing stress, and potentially saving money on fuel and vehicle maintenance costs. This further reinforces the positive feelings Tracy is likely to experience as a result of their choice to become more environmentally conscious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: In the opening paragraph of the letter, you should immediately introduce yourself or your company and your cause – specifically. Don't beat around the bush. People need to be hooked right out of the gate.  Don't assume people know who you are or what your organization does. Explain those things, clearly. Begin with a description of the company (if it's a corporate letter) or yourself (if it's for personal sponsorship). For example, such-and-such firm is a nonprofit organization committed to rehabilitation... etc. Highlighting a few accomplishments right away will make it clear why it's not a risk to give you sponsorship. Make it very clear how the money will be specifically used. In the second paragraph or first, you need to make the direct request for sponsorship and explain why you are seeking it. In order to give you sponsorship, a company or person needs to be convinced they will benefit from doing so. So in the middle paragraphs of the letter, clearly communicate the benefits – not to you, but to them.  If the sponsors will get good publicity out of the sponsorship, for example, explain how.  Be very specific: Will the event be televised? How many people will be attending? Will there be VIPS? If other prominent companies or their competitors are sponsoring your event, you might want to mention that. Give the sponsors options. They will like the fact they have different choices to match their individual needs or budgets. This means including a few numbers – audience size, for example, or demographics of those they will reach.  Also don't forget to thread in an element of emotional appeal - a personal story of someone who will be helped, for example, if said briefly (in a sentence or two) can be very moving. Explain how you will give the sponsors recognition for their sponsorship. Perhaps they can have free booth space at your event in exchange for sponsorship.   Provide the essential details of the sponsorship deal that they will need to make their decision. Don't forget to include contact information. You might want to also include a self-addressed, stamped envelope to make it easier for them to respond. Don't forget to include the date you need a response by. Ask the sponsors how they prefer to be recognized. For example, how do they want their name to appear and do they want to be recognized? Offer possibilities but never assume. Ask. You should provide some concrete details in the letter to back up your organization or event.  For example, if you're writing a letter for a charity, you should explain the background of the charity, such as when it was founded, who runs it, who it serves, and any awards or accomplishments it's received. Show don't tell. Don't just tell us the group or event are good or worthy. Convince us through showing details – evidence that backs up why or how the event or group are good or worthy. Evidence is more persuasive than superlatives, generally. Just sending off a letter to a company is not the most personal way to develop a connection. Although a sponsorship letter is a good idea, follow up in a more personal manner.  You could call or stop by if you don't get a response in 10 days. Remember though that many CEOS especially will be very busy and could be annoyed. So you might want to schedule an appointment or call first. Make sure that you convey excitement about your project. Avoid anything negative. You don't want to sound like you're begging or trying to put a guilt trip on them about donating.. If the answer is “maybe,” don't feel bad about following up. Just don't do it immediately or too much or you might become annoying. Never be presumptuous. Don't assume they will give you a meeting or sponsorship. Simply thank them for their consideration.   Don't forget to send a thank you note if you get a sponsorship. What is a summary?","output":"A sponsorship letter is a crucial tool in securing financial support for an organization, event, or cause. To effectively persuade potential sponsors, the letter should: 1. Introduce yourself or your company and your cause specifically, detailing the company's background, objectives, and accomplishments.   2. Clearly explain how the sponsorship funds will be used and make a direct request for sponsorship, outlining why you need the support. 3. Highlight the benefits the sponsor will obtain, such as publicity or audience reach, and be specific in terms of event attendance, media coverage, and previous sponsors. 4. Provide different sponsorship options to accommodate sponsors' needs or budgets, including relevant data and appeal to their emotions with a personal story if relevant. 5. Offer recognition for the sponsors' support and give essential details of the sponsorship deal. 6. Include contact information, response deadlines, and inquire about the sponsor's preferences for being recognized. 7. Develop a more personal connection by following up on the sponsorship letter with a call or meeting, always maintaining a professional and appreciative tone, and remembering to send a thank you note if sponsorship is granted."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Men in Black II Movie plot: Five years after the retirement of Agent K (Jones) from MIB, the secret New York City-based agency that monitors and regulates extraterrestrials residing on Earth, Agent J (Smith)âK's former partner and hand-picked replacementâis called to investigate the murder of an alien at his pizzeria. The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card. K recovers both, to the aliens' horror, but J gives them his watch as a replacement, and becomes their new deity. At the video store, as J and K... My question: Where is K working as postmaster?

OPT:  (A). no  (B). yes","output":"To answer the first question, I will do a quick research on states in Mexico where the Hindi language is spoken. Step 1: Research states in Mexico and the languages spoken in each state. Justification: To determine if any state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi, it is necessary to gather data about the languages spoken in Mexico. Result: After researching, I found out that no state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi as their main language. Spanish is the official language of Mexico, and other regional languages like Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, and Mixtec are also spoken in various states. Hindi is not a predominant language in Mexico. Now, I will answer the second question. Step 2: Identify which region or country the question is referring to. Justification: In order to determine which state speaks pure Hindi, it's important to clarify the geographical context. Result: The question does not specify a country or region. Therefore, I will assume the question is referring to the world, and I will answer based on the country where Hindi is predominantly spoken. Step 3: Research the primary country where Hindi is spoken and determine the areas where pure Hindi is spoken. Justification: Knowing the primary country where Hindi is spoken will allow me to determine the specific areas or states within that country where pure Hindi is spoken. Result: After researching, I found that Hindi is predominantly spoken in India. Within India, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh are known for speaking pure Hindi.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrived in Paris on Sunday morning, less than two weeks after a judge dismissed sexual assault charges against him in an international scandal that altered France's political landscape. The former International Monetary Fund chief was greeted with applause at a Paris airport before leaving in a private car and coming home to his apartment. He was accompanied by his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair. On Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was mobbed by reporters in New York as he left the brownstone where he had been staying. His homecoming marks the end of a four-month court battle involving a man who had been favored to be the next president of France. Strauss-Kahn was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on May 14 in New York over accusations he sexually assaulted a Guinean maid in a luxury hotel suite in the city. Days later, he resigned from the International Monetary Fund, spent a few days in jail and was put under house arrest. His lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout the process. \\"There was an act in that room that was consensual, not forcible,\\" Benjamin Brafman said. Questions arose over the credibility of the accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to back off. In July, prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest and dropped the charges on August 23, citing the accuser's credibility issues. \\"If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so,\\" prosecutors said at the time. Strauss-Kahn largely remained in New York even after a judge removed his house arrest restrictions. The diplomat's return to Paris on Sunday marks his first since the scandal broke out. Strauss-Kahn's arrest sent shock waves through France and redefined the landscape of the country's upcoming presidential race. His homecoming raises the possibility of his return to politics or a prominent position in the government. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo and an accusation of attempted rape by a French writer. The diplomat and his wife have been one of France's power couples since they married in 1989.

A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts.

Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight.

Expressing oneself is a vital part of human interaction. When we take the time to express ourselves, we provide others with an insight into our thoughts, feelings, and perspectives. This can lead to a better understanding of who we are, as well as how we view and experience the world around us. Being understood offers numerous benefits, some of which are highlighted below: 1. Enhanced Relationships: When we are understood by others, our relationships can evolve and strengthen. This is because empathy, trust, and open communication set the foundation for meaningful connections. 2. Reduced Misinterpretations: If we express ourselves clearly and authentically, we minimize the chances of our intentions or thoughts being misinterpreted. This can save us from countless misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts. 3. Increased Self-awareness: When we communicate our needs, desires, or boundaries, we gain a better understanding of ourselves.

Egypt's state news agency says the country's top prosecutor has referred ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi to trial on charges of inciting the killing of opponents protesting outside his palace while he was in office.      A supporter of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi chants slogans against Egyptian Army during a march following Friday Muslim prayers at Nasser City in Cairo, Egypt, Friday, Aug. 30, 2013. Tens of... (Associated Press)      The military ousted Morsi on July 3 after millions took to the street demanding he step down. He's been held incommunicado since. Prosecutors have accused him of conspiring with foreign groups to break out of prison during the chaos of the country's 2011 uprising.      Sunday's decision however is the first referral to trial. Morsi will be tried, along with 14 members of his Muslim Brotherhood, in a criminal court for allegedly committing acts of violence, inciting the killing of at least 10.      No date was announced for the trial.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      Egypt's interim president appointed a 50-member committee Sunday dominated by secularists to review proposed amendments to the country's Islamist-drafted constitution, moving ahead with a military-backed transition plan as protests over the coup that ousted the country's president wane.      The committee is to begin discussions Sept. 8 on the changes proposed by a 10-member panel of judges, also appointed by interim President Adly Mansour. It is then expected to put the amended charter to a public vote within 60 days, presidential spokesman Ihab Badawi said.      That follows a military-backed transition plan that calls for parliamentary and presidential elections early next year in the wake of the July 3 popularly backed coup that toppled President Mohammed Morsi.      The new review committee is dominated by liberal and secular public figures and politicians. Five women sit on the committee. There are four representatives from the youth groups that led the protests against Morsi and his predecessor, longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. There are also only three church representatives on the committee and no private citizens who are Christians.      There are three representatives of Al-Azhar, the Sunni world's most prestigious learning institute that represents moderate Islam. There are also representatives from professional unions, universities and the arts.      Badawi said Morsi' group, the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, and five other Islamist parties were tapped to nominate candidates. Only one, Bassam el-Zarka of the leading ultraconservative al-Nour party, came forward.      The Salafi al-Nour party said the selection criteria for the judges and their discussion to amend articles was less transparent than the actions of committee under Morsi, which were carried live on television. Al-Nour said it would argue in the committee to restore articles that stress the Islamic nature of the state, and outlaw insulting religious figures and violating social mores, which would be removed in an amendment proposed by the judges.      Badawi said a former member of the Brotherhood, Kamal el-Helbawi, also has agreed to sit on the committee and \\"will take into consideration the interests\\" of the group.      It is not yet clear how the committee will vote on the amendments, an issue which could complicate and prolong discussions. The amendments suggested by the judges removed controversial articles from the constitution, which were hotly contested by Morsi's opposition. Some articles gave Muslim clerics a final say over legislation, and one gave room for stricter interpretation and implementation of Islamic laws.      The Islamist-drafted constitution was one of the most divisive issues during Morsi's one year in office. It was suspended after the military ousted Morsi on July 3 following massive protests demanding he step down.      Lawmakers elected the Islamist-dominated 100-member committee that drafted the constitution under Morsi. It included 60 people affiliated with Islamist groups, six women and six Christians. That selection raised criticism of poor representation from youth groups and the secular opposition.      Liberals twice walked out of committees drafting the constitution, complaining that the Brotherhood and its allies dominated the process and stifled their suggestions. They said the charter undermined freedoms and rights and sought to imbue a strict interpretation of Islam into Egypt's laws.      Protests over the constitution and the direction of the country turned deadly after Morsi issued temporary decrees in late November that put himself and the drafting committee above judicial oversight. The constitution was then finalized in a rushed overnight session and passed with a slight majority in a hastily called referendum in December 2012. ||||| Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi hold his picture and a poster (R) showing the ''Rabaa'' or ''four'' gesture, in reference to the police clearing of the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp on August 14, during a protest against the military and the interior...      CAIRO Egypt's army-backed authorities referred deposed President Mohamed Mursi to trial on Sunday on charges of inciting murder and violence, in an escalation of the crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood.      The new government also named a constituent assembly almost devoid of Islamists and gave it 60 days to review amendments that would erase Islamic articles brought in last year by the Brotherhood and more hardline Islamic parties.      Nearly two months after the army deposed Mursi, the moves underscored Egypt's dramatic power shift as its new rulers tighten their grip and crack down on the Islamists who rose to power through the ballot box after Hosni Mubarak's downfall.      A state prosecutor charged Mursi and 14 other Brotherhood members with \\"committing acts of violence, and inciting killing and thuggery\\", the state news agency reported.      The charges relate to violence in which around a dozen people were killed outside the presidential palace last December, after Mursi had ignited protesters' rage with a decree that expanded his powers.      The episode was one of the most violent of his presidency. Tens of thousands gathered outside the presidency to demonstrate against Mursi's decree and a divisive, Islamist-tinged constitution that he planned to put to a referendum.      The Brotherhood's leaders called on members to rally to his defense. The state news agency said they were now accused of mobilizing their followers to forcibly disperse the protesters after the security forces rejected Mursi's orders to do so.      The charges against Mursi include inciting his followers and assistants to commit crimes of premeditated murder and use violence and thuggery.      Mursi is also being investigated over his escape from jail during the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. He is suspected of murder and conspiring with the Palestinian group Hamas during his escape, though no formal charges have been brought.      Both the European Union and the United States, source of 1.3 billion in annual military aid to Cairo, had called for Mursi's release after he was detained following his overthrow on July 3.      MASS PROTESTS      He was toppled just a year into his term following mass protests fuelled by anger at economic mismanagement and Brotherhood attempts to entrench its power.      His downfall has led to some of the worst violence in Egypt's modern history, in the form of protests by his supporters, a bloody police crackdown on those supporters, and militant attacks on the police and churches.      At least 900 people, most of them Mursi supporters, were killed last month after the authorities smashed two protest camps set up by Mursi's supporters in Cairo.      Around 100 of the dead were members of the security forces, killed in what the state has described as a Brotherhood campaign of terrorism. The group denies resorting to violence, saying the government is using the charge to justify the crackdown.      Mursi's fall has also triggered a spike in violence in the Sinai Peninsula, where hardline militants expanded into a security vacuum left by the 2011 uprising against Mubarak.      Underlining the growing threat of attacks, an army source said three people had been arrested for opening fire with machine guns on a ship passing through the Suez Canal, the global shipping artery that runs through Egyptian territory.      During Saturday's unsuccessful attack, the Panamanian-registered container ship COSCO ASIA came under fire in a northern section of the canal, the source said. Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade was also used.      The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful resistance. It managed to bring thousands into the street last Friday in demonstrations against what it views as a \\"putschist regime\\" that aims to turn Egypt back into a police state.      The government says it will restore democracy with parliamentary and presidential elections once amendments to the constitution are approved in a referendum.      PANEL OF 50      The presidency named a 50-member panel that will review an extensive set of amendments drawn up by a \\"panel of experts\\".      The proposals would remove Islamic-influenced articles including one that gave Muslim scholars a say over some affairs of state, and also lift a ban on some Mubarak-era officials assuming public office.      Drawn up by a 10-member \\"committee of experts\\" appointed by decree, the draft preserves the privileged status of the military, which it effectively shields from civilian oversight.      Although Islamists won five popular votes held since 2011, the constituent assembly will have only two Islamists among its members. One belongs to the hardline Salafi Nour party, the other is a former Brotherhood leader now harshly critical of the group he left last year.      \\"It's a very establishment list,\\" said Nathan Brown, an expert on Egypt based at George Washington University in the United States.      The presidency said six Islamist parties, including the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, had been approached to fill the two seats set aside for Islamists. Only Nour had responded. The Brotherhood says it wants nothing to do with the army's plans for Egypt.      The Brotherhood and the Nour Party secured a major say over the last constitution-drafting process by winning some 70 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections held after Mubarak's downfall.      Critics said the Islamists then sidelined other groups in a process that failed to reflect Egypt's diversity. The constitution was signed into law last December by Mursi after being approved in a referendum.      The Nour Party complained of a \\"disregard and exclusion of the Islamist current\\" in the make-up of the review panel.      Nour, which was founded after Mubarak's fall, noted that the committee left out members of the youth movements that ignited the uprising of January 25, 2011, \\"raising doubts about the panel's position towards the revolution\\".

Title: Awakenings Movie plot: In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a dedicated and caring physician at a Bronx hospital. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 encephalitis lethargica epidemic, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states: Activities such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. While patient Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, Sayer soon discovers that Lowe is able to communicate with him using a Ouija board.After attending a lecture on the subject of L-Dopa and its success with Parkinson's sufferers, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Lowe yields astounding results, as he completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state; inspiring Sayer to seek funding so that all his patients can receive L-Dopa and experience \\"awakenings\\" back to reality.Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another patient, and begins spending time with her when she comes to the hospital to visit her father. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions on him as an in-patient, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases, and stirs up a bit of a revolt in the process of arguing his case repeatedly to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated while battling administrators and staff about his perceived confinement, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest that Leonard has difficulty controlling.While Sayer and the hospital staff continue to delight in the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary triumph.

Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself.

The speaker knows or has come to realize that the given situation is not a dream, but instead is a real-life event or circumstance. This phrase can be used in various contexts, such as accepting the reality of a situation or refuting someone's claim that something is imaginative or unreal. The phrase contains several key elements which contribute to the meaning: 1. \\"Já vím\\" (I know) - This represents the speaker's certainty and awareness. By stating this, they are implying that they have knowledge and understanding of the matter. 2. \\"že\\" (that) - This conjunction connects the Speaker's certainty (I know) to the statement that follows and introduces the specific information. 3. \\"to není\\" (this isn't) - This phrase shows negation and focuses on denying the existence or occurrence of something. It emphasizes the point that the speaker does not agree with the idea that the situation is a dream or imaginary. 4. \\"sen\\" (dream) - The dream in this context refers to any situation or instance that is not considered to be a part of one's tangible, waking reality. By referring to a dream, the speaker draws attention to the difference between reality and fantasy, and it can also have a metaphorical sense, such as implying that it is not too good to be true or out of reach of their expectation.

Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a  closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low.  Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high.  Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. A:","output":"According to the given information and hint, the container with a lower pressure inside it will be the one that has its gas at a lower temperature. In this case, Nicholas keeps his closed container of nitrogen gas in the freezer, where the temperature is very low, while Justin keeps his closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. The pressure change in a container holding a gas is related to the temperature change via the ideal gas law, which is expressed as: PV = nRT Where: - P is the pressure of the gas - V is the volume of the container - n is the amount of gas (in moles) - R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) - T is the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin) When the temperature of a gas in a closed container decreases, like that of the nitrogen gas in the freezer, the pressure of the gas also decreases. This is because the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is reduced, causing them to exert less force during collisions with the walls of the container. In contrast, when the temperature increases, as in the case of the propane gas container outside, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, leading to more forceful collisions and increased pressure. Given that Nicholas's container of nitrogen gas is kept in the freezer at a low temperature and Justin's container of propane gas is kept outside at a relatively higher temperature, the container of nitrogen gas will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist  at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres  - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The premise: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" In this statement, the speaker uses the phrase \\"biting you\\" to ask the listener about their concerns or issues in a metaphorical manner. The term \\"biting\\" is often used to express annoyance or irritation. Therefore, the overall meaning of the premise is to ask the person what is bothering or causing discomfort to them at that moment. The hypothesis: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" This statement has a similar intention as the premise. The speaker asks about the listener's concerns or issues but uses the word \\"bothering\\" instead of the metaphorical \\"biting\\". Both the hypothesis and premise have the same goal: to inquire about the person's current concerns or irritations. Now let us consider the options: a) Yes: Choosing this option would mean that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would also be true. Since both the premise and the hypothesis have the same intention and meaning, it is possible that when one holds true, the other also holds true. Both are inquiries into the person's concerns, and stating one does not contradict the other. b) It is not possible to tell: Selecting this option would indicate that there is not enough information to determine the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. However, as we have analyzed the meaning and intention of both statements, they seemed to closely align in meaning and purpose. c) No: Choosing this as an answer would mean that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is not true. However, this doesn't seem applicable in our case, as both statements have the same meaning and intention. Based on the analysis and comparison of the premise and hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that: If the premise is true: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" Then it is possible that the hypothesis is also true: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" Hence, the answer to the question is a) yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

What is the answer: Which other US President died on July 4th 1826, the same day as John Adams?","output":"Thomas Jefferson was the other US President who died on July 4th, 1826, the same day as John Adams. The deaths of these two Founding Fathers and former presidents on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence was seen as a remarkable coincidence and a historic event in the United States. Thomas Jefferson's and John Adams' lives were deeply intertwined in the history of the United States. While they had their differences and experienced phases of animosity, they both played crucial roles in the founding of the nation. Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Before that, he served as Vice President under John Adams, who was the second President of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Adams played a significant role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, and was one of the drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence.  Jefferson and Adams had a falling out due to their differing political views in the early years of the republic, but they later reconciled and resumed their friendship, engaging in a rich correspondence for more than a decade. This correspondence touched upon various intellectual, philosophical, and political subjects and cemented their bond. Both men passed away on July 4th, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence - an event that has been widely interpreted as a testament to their strong connection to the founding of the United States and the significance of their roles in shaping the country.  In a poignant twist, John Adams' last words were reported to be \\"Thomas Jefferson still survives,\\" unaware that Jefferson had, in fact, passed away just hours earlier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(B). yes.","output":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, so the answer is: (A). No. I will provide answers to both questions: 1. How does the U.N. get funding? The United Nations gets funding from its member states through assessed contributions and voluntary contributions.  Assessed contributions are mandatory payments made by member states, which are calculated based on each country's capacity to pay. This calculation is determined by factors such as a country's gross national income (GNI) and share of the world economy. The largest portion of assessed contributions goes toward the UN's peacekeeping efforts and the regular budget, which is used for day-to-day operations. Voluntary contributions come from member states, non-governmental organizations, and other private or public sources. These funds are directed towards specialized agencies, programs, or specific projects, and can vary greatly depending on the priorities of the contributor. 2. Is it true that the US is funding ISIS? It is not true that the US is intentionally funding ISIS. The United States has been actively engaged in countering the threat posed by ISIS and has provided military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to countries impacted by the group's activities. Additionally, the US-led international coalition has conducted airstrikes and provided training to local forces fighting against ISIS. However, it should be noted that in complex conflict situations, funds and weapons can sometimes unintentionally end up in the hands of undesirable or hostile groups, but this is not a direct indication that the US is intentionally funding ISIS."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: 'Halo 4' is franchise's best yet Combat in \\"Halo 4\\" is more strategic than the hard-charging style we've come to know from previous \\"Halo\\" games. (CNN) -- For all of its expected action and drama, the new \\"Halo 4\\" boils down to an essential question: Are its central characters humans, machines or something in between? The answer may still be unclear by the time you're done playing this fantastic game. This edition of the hugely popular \\"Halo\\" franchise was developed by 343 Industries, which took over after Bungie Studios, creators of the first four games, split from Microsoft. To its credit, 343 Industries has retained the intense first-person shooter action \\"Halo\\" fans are used to but upped the emotional interplay between the iconic Master Chief and his artificial-intelligence companion, Cortana. The action begins with Master Chief in cryosleep and Cortana starting to undergo rampancy, a condition for older AIs in which they actually think themselves to death. At one point, Cortana likens it to having 1,000 arguments with herself, but she tries desperately to hang on to her sanity to help the Chief, her human ally. The connection between these two characters makes this campaign really special. From the opening scene with Catherine Halsey, the creator of the story's super-soldier program, to its climax, the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story. Web series builds anticipation for 'Halo 4' Cortana seems more emotive than before -- a welcome addition to the character. Master Chief retains his detached, no-nonsense soldier persona for most of the campaign, but there are moments you want his helmet to come off so you can see the facial expressions you sense he's making. \\"Halo 4\\" hooked me emotionally before I realized it. Some scenes made me feel waves of despair or elation before I recognized I was mirroring the emotions in the game -- truly a sign of an immersive experience. The graphics of \\"Halo 4\\" are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments. Whether foliage for a jungle setting or the individualized movement of little bits of wreckage, each scene is treated with careful attention to the smallest element. Characters look like live-action actors, and their movements and emotions have a realistic, almost filmlike quality. This technique has been used in other games, but \\"Halo 4\\" raises the bar for others to emulate. The voice acting and dialogue are fantastic and help pull you into the story. You'll quickly hate some characters based merely on the inflection in their voice. (You may even wish you could shoot them in the face -- I know I did -- but you can't.) The game introduces a new character from the recent \\"Halo\\" Web series, and I sometimes wondered if I was missing inside jokes from the related \\"Halo\\" books. But knowing the entire \\"Halo\\" universe isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this game. There are eight missions in the single-player campaign, with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose. Combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward, hard-charging style we've come to know from previous \\"Halo\\" titles. For example, using the armor's jump-pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies. And other armor abilities allow Master Chief to create a floating turret, which I found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in. Don't worry, fans -- the big action sequences are still there. \\"Halo 4's\\" epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission, then pick off bad guys one by one in another. And of course, co-op and online multiplayer action is available if you want to include a friend or try your luck against an opponent. Despite all the mayhem, what stood out for me about \\"Halo 4\\" was the story. The new developers made an effort to delve into the characters we've known over the years and morph them into something fresh. The \\"man or machine\\" question becomes more prevalent as the game progresses, and I found myself looking at different missions and scenes through that lens. Is Cortana more human as her mind begins to splinter? Does John-117, the solder we know as Master Chief, become a robotic killing machine? Or have both influenced each other so much that the differences we expect between the two become mixed, creating a symbiotic relationship that only becomes evident when one side lets down the other? During one tense scene, Master Chief tells Cortana, \\"I was supposed to protect you.\\" She replies, \\"We were supposed to protect each other.\\" The deepening interactions between these two main characters enhance the narrative and make \\"Halo 4\\" a wonderful new addition to a beloved franchise -- and the best \\"Halo\\" campaign so far. It keeps me wanting to play over and over again. \\"Halo 4\\" is available now throughout most of the world and will be available Thursday in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive title. It is rated M for mature due to blood and violence. Online interactions are not rated. This review was done with a provided limited edition copy and is solely focused on the single-player campaign. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"\\"Halo 4\\" stands out as the best installment in the franchise so far, with impressive graphics, immersive storytelling, and a deep emotional connection between Master Chief and Cortana, making the game a truly captivating experience.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.

The exact delimitation, and the internal systematics, are a matter of debate; for long this group was used as a \\"wastebin taxon\\" to hold any fireflies with insufficiently resolved relationships. Regardless, they are very diverse even as a good monophyletic group, containing flashing and continuous-glow fireflies from the Holarctic and some tropical forms too. The ancestral Lampyrinae probably had no or very primitive light signals; in any case several modern lineages have returned to the pheromone communication of their ancestors independently it seems.  - A pheromone (from Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"to bear\\" and hormone, from Ancient Greek \\"\\") is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individuals. There are \\"alarm pheromones\\", \\"food trail pheromones\\", \\"sex pheromones\\", and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Pheromones are used from basic unicellular prokaryotes to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented. In addition, some vertebrates, plants and ciliates communicate by using pheromones.  - Diaphanes is a genus of firefly in the Lampyrinae subfamily .

Jimmy Kimmel created a parody of the classic \\"Schoolhouse Rock\\" explainer video, with his own version titled \\"I'm Just a Lie.\\" Kimmel's intent was to highlight the confusion President Trump's lies cause for children by mimicking the educational videos they are familiar with. The animated \\"lie\\" in Kimmel's video amusingly remarks, \\"I just popped out of the president's brain, and the very idea of me is completely insane,\\" as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. Seth Meyers, on the other hand, took a more analytical approach to his \\"closer look\\" segment, which focused on Trump's recent actions. He specifically discussed the events leading up to the allegations that the president asked former FBI chief James Comey to halt the Michael Flynn investigation. Meyers passionately called upon Republicans to take action, stating, \\"We need Republicans to stand up and do something because right now we got a president who is deeply unfit for the office.\\" Stephen Colbert revisited the allegations that Trump leaked classified information to Russian diplomats.

By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\"   - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated  and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims.

One of the featured guests was Takeru Kobayashi, the hot dog-eating champion, who agreed to take on the Gallon Challenge, a notorious food challenge that tests whether a person can drink a gallon of milk in 60 minutes. Sports fans will remember this dare from 2005, when 19-year-old Florida Marlins batboy Nick Cirillo was suspended for six games by the team for trying to complete the challenge. Dodgers pitcher Brad Penny had offered him 500 if he was successful. The suspension prompted Penny to point out the insanity of baseball’s policy on steroids at the time. “It’s kind of ridiculous that you get a 10-game suspension for steroids and a six-game suspension for milk,” Penny told the Miami Herald. A quick search of the terms “gallon challenge” or “milk chug” on YouTube reveals that while many have tried the Gallon Challenge, nearly all have failed.

Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","output":"In the context of the paragraph provided, Bill is working with sound effects that have varying frequencies, ranging from very high to very low. To understand the relationship between frequency and wavelength, it's necessary to comprehend the basics of wave properties and behavior. Sound travels in waves, and these waves have certain characteristics, such as frequency and wavelength. Frequency refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a specific time period, usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). High frequency sounds have more cycles per second, while low frequency sounds have fewer cycles per second. In general, sound with a higher frequency is considered as a high pitch sound, whereas sound with lower frequency is considered as a low pitch sound. Wavelength, on the other hand, is the physical length of one wave cycle. It is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in the same phase, such as two wave peaks or two troughs. Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other, according to the following formula: speed of sound = frequency × wavelength With the speed of sound being constant in a medium (approximately 343 meters per second in air at room temperature), it's clear that as the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease, and vice versa. Given this information, the high frequency sounds that Bill captured in the sound studio would have shorter wavelengths, while the low frequency sounds would have longer wavelengths. This inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength is applicable to all types of waves, including sound, light, and electromagnetic waves. In summary, high frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, while low frequency sounds have longer wavelengths."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: The Greeks (Greek: Ellenes) have been identified by many ethnonyms. The most common native ethnonym is \\"Hellen\\" (Ellen), pl. Hellenes (Ellenes); the name \\"Greeks\\" (Latin: Graeci) was used by the Ancient Romans and gradually entered the European languages through its use in Latin. The mythological patriarch Hellen is the named progenitor of the Greek peoples; his descendants the Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians correspond to the main Greek tribes and to the main dialects spoken in Greece and Asia Minor (Anatolia). Context: There is currently no satisfactory etymology for the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name of the priests of Zeus in Dodona, \\"Selloi\\" (Selloi; also Elloi Helloi), changed to Sellanes (by analogy with Akarnanes) and then to Hellanes and Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica where he places Ancient Hellas in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, where in his opinion the great deluge of Deucalion must have occurred. The land was inhabited by Selloi and Graeci, who later came to be known as Hellenes. In that regard Graici (Graikoi) was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. Homer mentions that the Selloi were the prophets of Zeus at Dodona, but he is referring to Zeus of Dodona as god of the Pelasgians who were Pre-Dorian populations. It is possible that the extension of a particular cult of Zeus in Dodona (a tendency among the Greeks to form ever-larger communities and amphictionies) caused the name to further extend to the rest of the peninsula.  However, this theory connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus, and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The toponyms, especially an ancient city Hellas in southern Thessaly and the Greek tradition indicate that the name Hellenes is Pre-Dorian and that it is more likely that the homeland of the Graikoi who were later called Hellenes was in central Greece. The Greek tradition mentions an earlier deluge of Ogyges in the region of Boeotia which was occupied by the Minyans a group of autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region was called Graike in ancient times probably after the old city of Graea (from Proto-Greek grau-j-, \\"old lady\\") on the coast.  Homer refers to Hellenes as an originally relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia. During the era of the Trojan War they were centered along the settlements of Alos, Alope, Trachis, and the Pelasgian Argos. This Homeric Hellas is expressly described as \\"kalligunaikos\\", kalligynaikos, \\"of beautiful women\\", and its warriors, the Hellenes, along with the feared Myrmidons, were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi).Alcman (7th century BC) also refers that the mothers of Hellenes were Graikoi. In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia with Pyrrha, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. The name Hellenes was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to legend it was founded after the Trojan War, by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen. Question: Are there any potential ideas as to how the name was created?. Whats the answer?","output":"There are several potential ideas and theories as to how the name \\"Hellenes\\" was created, but no definitive answer has been agreed upon. Some of the main theories include: 1. Selloi/Sellanes/Hellanes/Hellenes Theory: According to some scholars, the name Hellenes is derived from the priests of Zeus in Dodona, known as \\"Selloi.\\" It is believed that the name changed to Sellanes, then to Hellanes, and finally to Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica, where he identifies the land inhabited by Selloi and Graeci as Ancient Hellas in Epirus. 2. Graikoi/Graeci/Greeks Theory: Another theory suggests that \\"Graeci\\" or \\"Graikoi\\" was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus, used by the Illyrians. Over time, this name was adopted by the Greeks and later, European languages through its use in Latin. 3. Homeric Hellas Theory: Homer mentions Hellenes as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, known for beautiful women. During the Trojan War, these warriors were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes, and this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi). 4. Mythological Connection: In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes, was the son of Deucalion, who ruled with Pyrrha as the only survivors after the great deluge. This myth may have been invented when Greek tribes began to separate, indicating a common origin. The name \\"Hellenes\\" could have been popularized following the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League, which was an association of Greek tribes that protected the temples of Apollo and Demeter. In summary, there are multiple theories about the creation of the name \\"Hellenes,\\" each with its historical and mythological connections.

The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River.

Please write a short summary for the following article: COLLEGE FOOTBALL- BCS computer projections The most anticipated matchup in college football history actually lived up to its billing with one of the greatest games in history. Top-ranked USC kept its win-streak alive and secured its bid as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas in a Rose Bowl game that featured stellar performances from the heralded and unheralded alike. After a five-yard touchdown on a keeper by Heisman Finalist QB Vince Young put the Longhorns on top 7-0 half-way through the first quarter, fellow Heisman Finalist QB Matt Leinart revived an offense that looked sluggish on its first few possessions with three quick TD strikes to three different receivers and the Trojans found themselves up 21-7 at halftime. Aside from its first drive the Longhorn offense looked stale and one-dimensional. Things did not really get better in the third quarter either when Reggie Bush found his groove and then the endzone with a 32-yard run that improved the USC lead to 28-10 at the time. A David Pino field goal with a minute left in the third-quarter chipped the lead to 15, but Texas' chances still looked bleak. Apparently though, an entirely different Longhorn squad on both sides of the ball came out for the fourth quarter. USC punter Tom Malone's coffin-corner kick from the Longhorn's 36 went awry, allowing Aaron Ross to return the ball all the way to the USC four-yard line to set up a Ramonce Taylor touchdown. USC scored almost too quickly on its next possession, kicking a field goal to lead 31-20 with plenty of time to play at 10:37 in the fourth. On the second play of Texas' next possession, Vince Young put on one of the greatest shows in BCS history with a seemingly effortless 71-yard run that stunned the Trojans and left the millions watching in awe. He then took the snap from shotgun into the endzone on a draw to narrow the gap to just three after the successful two-point conversion. Texas forced USC into another short possession and punt to get the ball back on its own 12 yard line with about six minutes left in the game. It didn't quite take that long. A surprising burst from 270-pound freshman RB Henry Melton set up a 36-yard Pino field goal to cap unlikeliest of comebacks. The Trojans offensive weapons were just too much for the exhausted Longhorn's though. USC used runs by both Reggie Bush and LenDale White as well as four key completions by Leinart to prepare for a 43-yard field goal. Mario Danelo's kick sailed through the uprights with 31 seconds remaining and a Rose Bowl victory in sights. Young missed on deep attempts on the final Texas possession and the Trojans walked away the victors. The two-headed all-purpose monster of Bush and White combined for 360 yards from scrimmage and Leinart was spectacular in the biggest game of his illustrious collegiate career, going 22-40 for 290 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite leading his team to a successful comeback and turning even more heads with his rushing prowess, Young may want to rethink his NFL future after completing just eight of 22 passes, throwing zero touchdowns and coming up short when it truly counted. For now though, it's the same as it has been for three years, the Trojans are on top and everyone else is looking up at them.

In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable. Answer:","output":"The bands that were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" mentioned in the paragraph include Blondie, Talking Heads, the Cars, the Go-Go's, and the Police. These bands broadened their instrumental palette, incorporated dance-oriented rhythms, and worked with more polished production, distinguishing them from punk bands and resulting in them being labeled as \\"new wave\\" artists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team observed that the layer of ozone is being destroyed by air pollution?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts.

Write a title: The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that employers may post regulations in the workplace that critics contend will discourage workers from organizing bargaining units or engaging in other union activities.","output":"Title: The Impact of the National Labor Relations Board's Ruling on Employers Posting Workplace Regulations and the Potential Suppression of Union Activities Introduction:  Recently, a substantial ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has sparked controversy among employers and labor unions alike. This ruling, which allows employers to post workplace regulations related to union activities, has been met with criticism from those who believe it has the potential to inhibit workers from organizing bargaining units and engaging in other collective actions. Body: I. Overview of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Job and Authority     A. The NLRB: An independent federal agency tasked with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)     B. The NLRB's jurisdiction: Covers most private sector employers and employees, except for agricultural laborers, independent contractors, and those employed by a parent or spouse II. The Ruling that Permits Employers to Post Workplace Regulations     A. The crux of the ruling: Asserts that employers can display rules or posters that influence union activities     B. Examples of regulations: Restrictions on the use of company bulletin boards and email systems for union activities, rules surrounding employees gathering in break rooms, or soliciting signatures for union authorization cards on company property      III. Critiques of the Ruling and its Potential Effects on Union Activity     A. Critics contend that the ruling may suppress workers' rights to organize and participate in union-driven activities     B. Key concerns:         1. Employees may feel pressured to refrain from union organization due to potential employer retaliation         2. The presence of regulations could create an atmosphere of intimidation or fear around discussing or pursuing union matters IV. Employers' Perspective on the Ruling     A. Employers argue that posting workplace regulations is necessary for maintaining control over company property and ensuring employees focus on work-related tasks     B. The potential benefits for employers:         1. Enhanced workflow and productivity without interruptions from union-related activities         2. A decrease in potential conflicts and disputes emerging from union organization and discussions on company property         3. Greater overall control over company culture and employee conduct V. Balancing Interests: Striking a Compromise between Employers and Labor Unions     A. Recognizing and respecting employees' rights to organize and participate in union activities according to the NLRA     B. Establishing clear communication and understanding between employers and employees to avoid unnecessary disputes and conflicts Conclusion: The ruling by the National Labor Relations Board permitting employers to post workplace regulations has been met with significant controversy as critics argue that it may suppress workers' rights to engage in union activities. While employers maintain that regulations are necessary to protect company interests, it is crucial to strike a balance between the rights of both parties. Ensuring that employers respect and acknowledge their employees' rights to organize while establishing clear and open communication will help mediate conflicts and maintain a harmonious workplace environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Crown my teeth. The speech crowned the meeting. Does the word \\"crown\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"crown\\" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences provided. The term 'crown' is being used as a verb in both instances but it applies to different contexts: dental health and a social event, respectively.  1. \\"Crown my teeth\\" - In this sentence, 'crown' refers to a common dental procedure. A crown in dentistry is a type of dental restorative treatment. It's essentially a cap that completely covers or encircles a tooth or dental implant. Crowns are often used when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth. They are typically bonded to the tooth using a dental cement. Dental crowns can be made from various materials, which include ceramics, zirconia, porcelain, or metal. Crowning a tooth requires a number of steps. First, the dentist prepares the tooth by removing the outer portion, any decay and shaping the tooth for the crown. If additional tooth structure is needed to support the crown, a core build-up may be done. An impression is then made to provide an exact model of the prepared tooth. This is sent to a dental lab, where the permanent crown will be made. A temporary crown is made to protect the tooth while the permanent one is being made. Once ready, the permanent crown is cemented in place.  2. \\"The speech crowned the meeting.\\" - In this example, 'crowned' is a metaphorical usage, which means to conclude, climax, or bring something to a successful or impressive end - essentially to place a metaphorical highlight or \\"crown\\" on the event. This use of \\"crown\\" implies that the speech was the pinnacle or highlight of the meeting, it encapsulated or summarized the main points, or just capped the meeting off with a strong, memorable moment or message. In summary, while both uses of 'crown' imply an act of completion or finality, they refer to vastly different processes – one physical and specific, and one metaphorical and general. It is a great example of English's robust vocabulary replete with context-sensitive meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \\"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter  , and retailers   are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement   shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors   worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green.

Just like when you get a discount on a toy, this one is also a discount, but for a grown-up thing. We can see where this special discount happens because there are lines in a drawing called Figure 9, and they cross each other, like an 'X'. Now, let's look at sentence 2. It says that there is a 4.5a discount and we can see it in Figure 9, where the lines cross each other like an 'X'. So, if the first sentence is telling the truth, then the second sentence is also true because they both say you can find the 4.5a discount in Figure 9 where the lines are crossing like an 'X'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To determine whether the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true or not, we need more information and context regarding the premise \\"and run over.\\" The phrase \\"and run over\\" can imply that someone or something has experienced being run over, but without further context, we cannot definitively confirm if the statement \\"I have been run over\\" is accurate. There are several scenarios where the phrase \\"and run over\\" might apply. For example: 1. As part of a traumatic experience of an individual who is saying, \\"I have been pushed and run over by a car.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" would be true. 2. As part of a machine or robot's operational history where it narrates, \\"I have been programmed and run over numerous systems checks.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the context refers to running system checks and not physically being run over. 3. As part of a conversation where an individual is describing someone else's situation, like \\"She was traveling to the store and run over by an intoxicated driver.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the person saying the phrase is not the one who was run over. 4. As a figurative expression where an individual feels overwhelmed or taken advantage of, as in \\"I have been mentally exhausted and run over by my workload.\\" While the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" could be considered true in a metaphorical sense, it is not meant to be taken literally. Without more information about the context in which \\"and run over\\" is used, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true or not.

He talks about Jay Gatsby, the most hopeful man he had ever met. Nick's doctor suggests that he writes his thoughts down, since writing is Nick's passion. In the summer of 1922, Nick moves from the Midwest to New York after abandoning writing. He rents a small house in the North Shore village of West Egg, next to the mansion of Gatsby, a mysterious business magnate who often holds extravagant parties. One day, while Nick has dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, he is introduced to Jordan Baker by Daisy, who hopes to make a match between them.

It appears that the tweet is a response to a previous conversation or a question related to the potential uses of a ladder. Without complete context, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact sentiment; however, we can still infer certain aspects of the emotion behind the tweet. 1. Neutral or Open-minded: The message appears to have a neutral sentiment, suggesting there are multiple possibilities when it comes to using or modifying a ladder. The tone seems open-minded, allowing for creative or unconventional ideas from others while discussing what they \\"could do\\" with the ladder. 2. Casual and Informal: The tweet appears casual and informal in nature, thanks to the lowercase letters and the omission of punctuation. It indicates a laid-back, conversational approach to express the idea that many things could be done to or with the ladder. 3. Engaging and Encouraging: The tone of the tweet also comes across as engaging and encouraging. It involves the recipient of the tweet (either a user or a general audience) in the discussion and invites them to think creatively and share their own ideas on the topic. This can spark interest and invite potential solutions or suggestions from others. 4. Ambiguity: Being a short tweet stripped of context, there is an apparent ambiguity to the message, which makes it difficult to assign a specific sentiment. This is because the sentiment is partially affected by missing context clues or references, which shape how an emotion is perceived and inferred.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

[II] positive.).","output":"Title: The Inception of Imagination: A Dive into the Dream-Bending Blockbuster 'Inception' [Positive Review] People love stories that make them think, question reality, and fear the unknown. When a movie successfully tackles the complexities of the human mind and gives the audience a chance to ponder the boundaries of the possible world, it leaves them wanting more. That's exactly what 'Inception', directed by master storyteller Christopher Nolan, delivers - a captivating, thrilling, and boundary-pushing cinematic experience that leaves movie enthusiasts awestruck and eager to unravel its many layers. In 'Inception', we follow the story of Don Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in infiltrating dreams to steal secrets, ideas, and information from people's subconscious. When he is presented with the opportunity to regain his lost life, Cobb assembles a highly-skilled team and embarks on a perilous journey to execute the virtually impossible task of implanting an idea, or Inception, into the mind of a young businessman, Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy). As the story unfolds, viewers are plunged into the mind-bending world of dream layers, time manipulation, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Nolan's distinctive and innovative storytelling blended with top-notch acting performances from of a stunning ensemble cast makes the 'Inception' an absolute masterpiece. DiCaprio, as the tormented and gifted dream thief, delivers yet another exemplary performance that has become synonymous with the caliber of his acting. Other brilliant cast members, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Ken Watanabe, execute their roles with precision and artistry, creating characters that are both relatable and fascinating. With a nearly faultless script, 'Inception' challenges viewers to remain attentive and involved throughout every twist and turn. Employing the concept of dreams within dreams, as well as the intricate rules and consequences governing the dream world, Nolan's script is a complicated puzzle that requires multiple watch-throughs to extract its full potential. The film's pacing is excellent, steadily raising the stakes and building tension towards an emotional and intense climax. Visually, 'Inception' is nothing short of breathtaking. From the first scene, the audience is treated to spectacular visual effects and jaw-dropping cinematography. The famous \\"city-folding\\" scene, along with scenes of zero gravity, and the snowy fortress assault all demonstrate the power of cutting-edge visual effects, immersing the audience completely in the dream world. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's camera work captures the essence of Nolan's vision, creating a visually stunning world full of both intense and awe-inspiring moments. The exceptional soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer adds another dimension to the movie, making every moment pulse with energy, suspense, and emotion. The haunting melody of \\"Time\\" and the iconic \\"Inception\\" horn sound have etched themselves into cinema history, acting as a testament to Zimmer's abilities to thrill and move audiences through his musical compositions. In conclusion, Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is a crowning achievement in modern cinema, a deeply thought-provoking, visually stunning and masterfully executed film. With outstanding performances from its cast, an intricate yet engaging storyline, breathtaking visuals, and an unforgettable soundtrack, 'Inception' rightly holds its place as one of the greatest movies in history that leaves viewers questioning the depths of their own dreams and the tenuous boundaries between reality and imagination."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

In itself, this expression demonstrates a positive tone and is meant to bring a sense of happiness or warmth to the person receiving the message. 2. \\"@VioletJohe\\" – This is a mention of another Twitter user, indicating that the person is addressing or directing the message towards them. Here, the sentiment doesn't seem to be particularly negative or positive, but when combined with the rest of the tweet, it becomes part of a friendly interaction. 3. \\"ok, please.\\" – Although brief, this portion of the tweet can be interpreted as polite and respectful. The author is likely requesting something from @VioletJohe, but does so in a courteous manner by adding \\"please.\\" Generally, using polite language such as \\"please\\" or \\"thank you,\\" can be seen as a positive sentiment because it indicates respect and consideration towards others. Taking into account these points, it becomes apparent that the sentiment of the tweet is generally positive.

Legislation regarding sexual offences in the United Kingdom is devolved. Sex with an adult who is related as parent (including adoptive parent), grandparent, child (including adopted child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, is illegal. In England and Wales the offence is against the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which effectively replaced the offence of incest with two new wider groups of offences: familial child sex offences (sections 25--29) and sex with an adult relative (sections 64--65). These laws are intended to protect the rights of people, so as to avoid potential violation. However, these laws still outlaw consensual sexual relationships between family members, even if they are fully willing and knowledgeable to the potential consequences. There has been some debate surrounding the rhetoric used by the Sexual Offences Review Team. Roffee discusses how the language used manipulates the reader to deem consensual familial sexual acts as illegal to the point of immoral.

The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal.

The provided text dialogue is: \\"i am not ferari yes i know u said i donot know now say i know mean\\" Step 1: Understanding the Text This might come from a conversation where the speaker is clarifying a misunderstanding or emphasizing that they now understand something they previously did not. Step 2: Identifying the Emotion  Given the context and usage of words, the dialogue seems to come from a mildly frustrating interaction, where someone had to clarify or correct a misunderstanding. Therefore, the underlying emotion of the text appears to be 'angry' or 'frustrated', which will be categorized under 'other' as there isn't a specific class of 'frustrated' in the given options. Step 3: Applying Guidelines The task directions stated that I should identify the emotion as either happy, sad, angry, or other. Therefore, given the inferred emotion is frustration, which is more related to anger but not entirely the same, I'll select 'Other' as the most fitting category.

Given the question: Information:  - William Clark Gable (February 1, 1901  November 16, 1960) was an American film actor, often referred to as \\"The King of Hollywood\\" or just simply as \\"The King\\". Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926, and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931. The next year, he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades.  - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression.  - The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) is a drama school in London, England. It is one of the oldest drama schools in the United Kingdom, founded in 1904 by Herbert Beerbohm Tree.  - Oliver Burgess Meredith (November 16, 1907  September 9, 1997), was an American actor, director, producer, and writer in theater, film, and television.

He was the star of many successful films and television series throughout his career, such as \\"Bonanza\\", \\"Wagon Train\\", \\"The Twilight Zone\\", \\"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\\", and \\"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer\\". He is perhaps best known for his role as Midshipman Roger Byam in \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" (1935), starring alongside Clark Gable and Charles Laughton.  - The Academy Awards, or \\"Oscars\\", is an annual American awards ceremony hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements in the United States film industry as assessed by the Academy's voting membership.

I really really would not recommend this place. I came here because they offered deep dish pizza and I've read about Detroit style pizza not too long ago. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered an 11 inch deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage and wings  The pizza is, imo, on the cheaper side (in quality). The sauce isn't very spectacular. It tastes pre-packaged and you cannot taste almost any herbs in the sauce. It also doesn't taste really fresh. I noticed a chunk of dry oregano in the sauce but it didn't seem to add any flavor. The cheese is spread kinda thinly to boot, so you end up tasting more of the bread. It also does not have any particular flavor. Neither the pepperoni or the sausage stood out. Honestly the pepperoni and sausage toppings in Pizza Hut has more flavor. The crust is decent but that's as far as the positives go. The only saving grace for this place was the wings. They're done well but a place that bases its business on pizza shouldn't have better wings than pizza.   I don't know how they manage to make an awful pizza. It's on par with cafeteria/frozen pizza. Think Tombstone. Red Baron would be a step up above this place.  Go anywhere else. Glazier's grocery store is miles better than this pizza and better too. 7-8 versus 14 for a two person pizza. Sam's Club is better. The gas station pizza at Snacker's is better. Anywhere else but here. Save your money and take your business elsewhere. You'll thank me for it.

He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick.

At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back.\\" Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: \\"There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all.

Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.

Taped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973, the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television, which has now been replaced by Sony Pictures Television. The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating \`\`a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre.'' Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns. The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions. The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors' faces. Conboy said he used lighting to create \`\`artistic effects''. Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody. The Young and the Restless' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas. When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.

Although \\"A parent is brushing their child's teeth\\" often suggests that it could be part of a bedtime routine, it cannot be definitively concluded that \\"The child is getting ready for bed so their mother is helping them\\" based on the given information. There are several reasons as to why this assumption cannot be made. Firstly, the statement does not specify whether the parent brushing the child's teeth is the mother or the father. It simply mentions \\"a parent,\\" which leaves room for the possibility that the father or another caretaker is the one performing this task. Secondly, the time at which the teeth brushing is happening is not indicated. It is a common practice for people to brush their teeth not only at bedtime but also in the morning or after meals. As such, it is not guaranteed that this action is a part of the child's bedtime routine. Thirdly, the reason behind the parent assisting the child in teeth brushing is not mentioned. The child could have a disability or temporary difficulty that requires help from a parent, regardless of the time of day. Alternatively, the parent could be teaching the child proper dental hygiene, which would not necessarily be limited to bedtime preparation.

Read this and answer the question The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Question: When people got more work?

Please answer this question: What is the claim to fame of the US millionaire Dennis Tito who soared high and achieved a first of sorts on April 28, 2001?","output":"Dennis Tito, a US millionaire and entrepreneur, is best known for becoming the world's first self-funded space tourist on April 28, 2001. Born in Queens, New York on August 8, 1940, Tito made his fortune through his investment management firm, Wilshire Associates.  His fascination with space began during his early years when he studied astronautics and aeronautics at New York University and later at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, earning a degree in Astronautics and Aeronautics in 1962, and a Master's in engineering science in 1964. Tito later worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California for five years as an aerospace engineer, where he was involved in planning trajectory for numerous Mars missions by NASA Mariner spacecraft.  Although Tito had a successful career in finance, his dream of going to space never faded. In 1999, he turned to the Russian Space Agency, Rosaviakosmos (now called Roscosmos), to fulfill his spacefaring aspirations. Initially, Tito agreed to pay 20 million to visit the Russian space station Mir, but when the station was slated for de-orbiting in 2001, the plans were changed, and he was offered a seat on a Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS). His decision to become a space tourist received mixed reactions from the public, the media, and space agencies worldwide. NASA and other ISS partners initially opposed Tito's participation, citing concerns over his insufficient training, his impact on the crew's safety, and the potential commercialization of space travel. Despite these concerns, Tito underwent nearly eight months of rigorous cosmonaut training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, to prove his competence. Eventually, an agreement was reached, and Tito became a crew member on Soyuz TM-32 mission to the ISS, alongside Russian cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin. On April 28, 2001, the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft successfully lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Tito aboard, making him the first private individual to venture into space. During his 8-day mission, Tito orbited the Earth 128 times and spent nearly 48 hours on board the ISS, fulfilling his lifelong dream. Dennis Tito's journey to space marked the beginning of a new era of space tourism, opening up opportunities for a limited number of wealthy individuals to experience space travel. Following Tito's successful mission, six more space tourists have made the journey to the ISS and back, with the latest being Guy Laliberté, the founder of Cirque du Soleil, in 2009. Today, organizations such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are working on commercial space travel projects aiming to make space tourism more affordable and accessible to a wider audience."},{"instruction":"John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In 1834, Illinois voted whether to adopt Christmas as a legal holiday. Among those voting \\"nay\\" was the young Abraham Lincoln. In 1834, Lincoln had not yet grown out of his atheist phase, but the young Lincoln's lack of faith in God -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of Christ -- does not explain his vote. In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote. Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834. Lincoln marked his first Christmas as President, in December 1861, by holding a Cabinet meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening. The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards. Nobody was much shocked by these omissions. The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century. George Washington issued a proclamation on Thanksgiving, but he never made any statement about Christmas (or Easter for that matter). The first state to recognize Christmas as a holiday was Alabama, in 1836, but the North and especially New England resisted. Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday. The federal government took until 1870 to follow. There's debate on the point, but it seems that Benjamin Harrison was the first president to allow a Christmas tree inside the White House in 1889. The tradition of lighting a tree on the White House grounds commenced with Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards. Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly \\"seasonal.\\" It waited until John F. Kennedy in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene. This late flowering of Christmas observance reflects two facts about Christmas that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the \\"war on Christmas.\\" In its first century, the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything Americans would accept today. One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays. As evangelical forms of Christianity spread after 1800, the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the Sabbath. Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations. In response, Congress voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on Sunday, on pain of losing their positions. The Americans of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious, but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious. Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences. Calvinists and Baptists, Methodists and Catholics, the grandest Boston rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed, sometimes to the point of outright violence. Anti-Catholic riots ripped apart Boston, Philadelphia and Bath, Maine, between the 1830s and 1850s. These contending denominations could, however, agree at least that they did not want a remote government in Washington favoring some religious practices over others. Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath. Better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them. A second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to Christianity: the keen awareness of many 19th century Christians of the non-Christian origins of many Christmas traditions. Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia. Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition. The Christmas tree, the hanging of wreaths and house-to-house caroling hark back to the pre-Christian German holiday of Yule. Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century. But many Protestant denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century. Two changes made possible the coalescing of an official Christmas holiday over the 40 years from Calvin Coolidge's outdoor Christmas tree to John F. Kennedy's sacral Christmas card: The fading of distinctions between Christians and the decline of theology within Christianity. The once all-crucial distinctions between Calvinists and Arminians (whose beliefs came from Dutch reformist Jacobus Arminius) and between even Protestants and Catholics have blurred. The once-vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished, as American Christianity evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did. If Christians decorate trees, then tree decorating must be Christian -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it. Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course. Surrounding them, however, is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway. For them, a Christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity. Many Americans feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years. When they champion \\"Christmas as it was,\\" they do not mean \\"Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln\\" and much less \\"Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards.\\" They mean, \\"Christmas as it was when I was young.\\" That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus. If your Christmas celebrates the appearance of God Himself in the form of a human baby, it won't have a lot of room for a gift-giving elf and flying reindeer. But if Santa is at most tangential to the Christmas of faith, he is utterly central to the Christmas of folkway. It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about \\"the war on Christmas.\\" The Christmas of Santa and Rudolph, and trees and stockings, and candy canes and \\"Merry Christmas\\" greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the United States only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the historical aspect of Christmas celebrations in the United States and how it evolved through time. In the past, Christmas celebrations were not as widely accepted, with states like Massachusetts only recognizing it as a holiday in 1856 and the federal government following in 1870. The late adoption of Christmas as an official holiday by various states can be attributed to two factors: a stricter separation of church and state and awareness of non-Christian origins of the holiday. The shift to accept and celebrate Christmas as a universal holiday became possible when the distinctions between different Christian denominations faded and theology declined within Christianity. The modern celebration of Christmas also leans more towards being a cultural event rather than purely religious, with practices like having a Christmas tree and Santa Claus being more about group identity than individual beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the name of Herbert Greenleafs son? Dickie. Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Chasing Dickie\\" Synopsis: Tom Ripley, a struggling young artist with a checkered past, receives an exciting proposition from the wealthy businessman Herbert Greenleaf. Dickie, Herbert's charismatic and globe-trotting son, has recently cut off all ties with the family, and Herbert is desperate to reconnect with him. He enlists Tom's help in tracking down Dickie and finally unveiling the mystery behind his disappearance. Plot: The movie begins in New York City, where Tom Ripley, a talented artist burdened by financial troubles, strikes up an unexpected friendship with the affluent Herbert Greenleaf. When Herbert learns about Tom's resourcefulness and cunning, he hires him to track down his estranged son, Dickie, with the promise of a generous reward. Tom, eager for a fresh start, leaves his life behind and sets off for Europe to find Dickie. After following a series of leads, Tom finally locates Dickie in a small coastal town in Italy. He's astonished to find that Dickie has created a new life for himself, living under a false identity and running a successful art gallery. The two men form an uneasy alliance, and Tom agrees to keep Dickie's secret in return for a cut of the profits from the gallery. As Tom becomes increasingly enmeshed in Dickie's world, he learns that there's more to his friend's disappearance than meets the eye. Dickie is being pursued by a dangerous criminal organization who believe he possesses a valuable artifact they're after - an ancient artifact that Dickens stole during his travels in the Middle East. With the criminals closing in, Tom and Dickie are forced to go on the run, with Herbert's private investigators and the local authorities hot on their trail. As they travel across Europe in search of answers, the two men build an unsteady friendship based on shared secrets and mutual deception. During their journey, Tom pieces together the truth about the artifact and discovers that it's part of a mythical treasure that's been sought for centuries. Realizing its immense value, Tom devises a plan to steal the artifact and partner with Dickie to sell it to the highest bidder. However, when they are finally cornered by the relentless criminals and the authorities, Tom must choose between loyalty to his friend and securing his future with the treasure. Ultimately, Tom makes a decision that will alter the course of both their lives forever. The movie culminates in a thrilling showdown in the heart of an ancient city, where Tom uses his wits and resourcefulness to outsmart the criminals and save Dickie. In the end, the two men are forced to face the consequences of their actions, and the true meaning of friendship and loyalty is tested. \\"Chasing Dickie\\" is an enthralling adventure, rooted in the bonds of friendship and the pursuit of identity. It tells the story of two men brought together by a shared secret, and the fateful choices that change their lives forever."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Fossil Record is a biannual peer-reviewed scientific journal covering palaeontology. It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde).  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".  - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.   - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered.  - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft.  - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case.  - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia.  - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee.  - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon .  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is they this sentence? Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them.","output":"In the sentence \\"Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them,\\" the first entity mentioned is raccoons, which are medium-sized mammals native to North America, known for their distinct black mask-like facial markings and bushy, ringed tails. They are highly adaptable creatures and can be found in various habitats, including forests, wetlands, agricultural areas, and urban environments. The second entity mentioned in the sentence is people or humans. This is referring to the Homo sapiens species, which are the dominant and most advanced beings on planet Earth. People are known for their intelligence, ability to communicate using complex languages, tool-making skills, and social structures. In this sentence, raccoons are depicted as engaging in an interesting and unusual behavior: playing dead when people come near. The act of \\"playing dead\\" is also known as thanatosis and is an adaptive behavior exhibited by some animals in order to prevent themselves from being attacked or eaten by predators. By appearing dead, the animal might be perceived as unappetizing or even dangerous to the approaching predator, causing the predator to lose interest and move on. The reason provided for this behavior in raccoons is that they are frightened by humans. This fear might stem from past experiences with people, such as being hunted, harassed, or disturbed in some way. It could also be an innate response to seeing large, unfamiliar creatures like humans approaching their territory. Furthermore, the sentence implies a constant behavioral factor, meaning that raccoons may exhibit this behavior repeatedly when they encounter humans. This indicates that playing dead might be a successful strategy for these animals in avoiding harm and maintaining their safety in the presence of potential threats. In conclusion, the main entities in the sentence are raccoons and people. The raccoons are portrayed as playing dead consistently when in close proximity to humans, presumably to protect themselves from potential harm due to fear or past experiences with people. This adaptive strategy has likely evolved over time to help raccoons survive encounters with the dominant and sometimes aggressive human species."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Founded in 1994, the band consists of guitarist Michael Romeo, keyboardist Michael Pinnella, drummer Jason Rullo, lead vocalist Russell Allen and bassist Michael Lepond. They achieved some commercial success with the 2007 album Paradise Lost and the 2011 album Iconoclast, which reached number 76 on the Billboard 200. Romeo explained the band's name in a 2008 interview; \\"So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word 'Symphony' came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? On March 1, 2010, an update on the Symphony X official website announced, that the band had recorded most of their next album and that Romeo and Allen were working on lyrics; Romeo was getting ready to start doing tracking for the album. The album's name and lyrical concept were revealed on January 29, 2011 in an interview by DJ JC Green of Metal Messiah Radio's \\"Heavy Metal Thunder\\" show with Russell Allen: the follow-up to Paradise Lost will be titled Iconoclast and will have its lyrics centered around \\"machines taking over everything and all this technology we put our society into pretty much being our demise.\\" On March 25, 2011, it was announced on the Nuclear Blast website and Blabbermouth.net, that the new Symphony X album, Iconoclast, would be released in Europe on June 17 and in North America on June 21, as a Standard Edition as well as a 2-CD Digipack. Iconoclast debuted at number 76 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, selling more than 7,300 copies in its first week. The record also debuted at number 7 on the Top Hard Rock Chart, number 19 on the Top Rock Chart and number 13 on the Top Independent Chart. The album showcases the highest chart position and the most first-week sales in the band's history.  On February 25, 2011, Symphony X played the first show of their 2011 tour in Stuttgart, Germany, where they performed two songs from Iconoclast: \\"End of Innocence\\" and \\"Dehumanized\\".

This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections  , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of  hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact   on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies.

Article:","output":"Title: A Disturbing Look into the Mind of Alyssa Bustamante: A Teenage Killer In 2009, the small community of St. Martins, Missouri, was shattered by a gruesome crime that has continued to haunt its residents. Alyssa Bustamante, a 15-year-old girl, brutally murdered her 9-year-old neighbor, Elizabeth Olten. What followed was a horrifying testimony from the killer, who showed no remorse and even admitted to finding the act of taking a life \\"enjoyable.\\" The chilling details of this case bring to light the question of how such a young person could commit such a heinous crime, and the events surrounding the murder raise serious concerns about the effect of psychological disorders on the actions of teenagers. At the time of Elizabeth's death, Alyssa was in the midst of a downward spiral. Although she attended church regularly with her family, underneath the façade of piety, Alyssa was dealing with severe mental health issues. An excerpt from her personal diary revealed her disturbed mindset as she wrote, \\"As soon as you get over the \\"ohmygawd I. can't do this\\" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable... Kay, I gotta go to church now.\\" Following the murder, Alyssa was not able to hide her dark side from authorities, and her true nature became the center of attention during her trial. Elizabeth's mother, understandably angered and distraught by her daughter's untimely death, voiced her opinion of the killer, stating that Alyssa was \\"not even human.\\" To comprehend how a teenager like Alyssa could become so detached from reality and engage in such a horrific act, it is important to consider the possible factors that contributed to her mental state. Mental health professionals have pointed to childhood trauma, unstable home environments, and the inability to form healthy relationships as potential contributors to the development of severe behavioral issues in teenagers. The tragedy of Elizabeth Olten's senseless murder is a stark reminder of the need for early intervention and proper treatment for at-risk youth. If the warning signs of Alyssa Bustamante's escalating behavior had been recognized and addressed sooner, perhaps Elizabeth's life could have been spared. In conclusion, the case of Alyssa Bustamante sends a chilling message about the importance of identifying and treating mental health issues in young people. As a society, we must be vigilant in recognizing the symptoms of psychological distress and provide support to help prevent more innocent lives from being taken at the hands of troubled teenagers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The scoring began early in the first quarter when Pittsburgh's Tyler Matakevich blocked a Britton Colquitt punt, knocking the ball into the end zone where it was recovered by Anthony Chickillo for a touchdown. The Browns were able to tie the score by the end of the first quarter, however, as rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer orchestrated a 12-play drive that ended when he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The game stayed at 7-7 through most of the second quarter, until the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger connected with tight end Jesse James on a 4-yard touchdown with 45 seconds left in the first half. The 7-play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball. After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14-10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21-10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown. The score remained 21-10 until under four minutes remained in the game, when Kizer was able to throw his first career touchdown pass to Corey Coleman. A two-point conversion run by Isaiah Crowell brought the Browns to within a field goal, 21-18. The Browns did not get a chance to score again, however, as the Steelers were able to run out the clock after a long pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. Browns head coach Hue Jackson challenged the ruling; however, the catch call on the field was upheld.

The Robertsons embark on an unexpected journey as they protect their newfound fortune while evading the US Treasury Department, which insists on turning over the duck for reasons unknown. As the story begins, the Robertson family has recently moved to a small town in Northern California to escape the busy city life. During one of their hikes, Lucy stumbles upon an ordinary-looking duck that appears to be injured. The compassionate family takes the duck home, nursing it back to health. They decide to call the duck \\"Goldie.\\"  Over time, the Robertson family begins to notice that their duck is unlike any other. Miraculously, Goldie starts laying golden eggs! Initially, the family doesn't know what to make of it, but they quickly realize the eggs are valuable and can change their fortunes. News of Goldie and her extraordinary ability spreads throughout the town, eventually catching the attention of the US Treasury Department. The Treasury contacts the family and demands them to turn over the duck, citing the Gold Reserve Act. According to the agents, Goldie's ability to lay golden eggs compromises the stability of the country's gold reserves and the economy. However, the US Treasury Department and Agent Stevens - a determined but comically bumbling agent - have ulterior motivations for acquiring Goldie. Stevens is secretly working on behalf of a mysterious organization that aims to harness Goldie's abilities for their economic profiteering and world domination. The Robertson family refuses to turn in their beloved Goldie and, in response, they go on the run, evading the Treasury agents while trying to uncover the true intentions behind their pursuit. They utilize Goldie's gifts to obtain resources needed to stay one step ahead of the determined yet inept Agent Stevens and his team.

Write a summary based on this article: Senator John McCain passed documents to the FBI director, James Comey, last month alleging secret contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow and that Russian intelligence had personally compromising material on the president-elect himself.            The material, which has been seen by the Guardian, is a series of reports on Trump’s relationship with Moscow. They were drawn up by a former western counter-intelligence official, now working as a private consultant. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published the documents, which it said were “unverified and potentially unverifiable”.      Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI? Read more      The Guardian has not been able to confirm the veracity of the documents’ contents, and the Trump team has consistently denied any hidden contacts with the Russian government.      A spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday denied Russia has collected compromising information on Trump and dismissed news reports as a “complete fabrication and utter nonsense”. Dmitry Peskov insisted that the Kremlin “does not engage in collecting compromising material”.      Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but late on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “FAKE NEWS – A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” He made no direct reference to the allegations.      An official in the US administration who spoke to the Guardian described the source who wrote the intelligence report as consistently reliable, meticulous and well-informed, with a reputation for having extensive Russian contacts.      Some of the reports – which are dated from 20 June to 20 October last year – also proved to be prescient, predicting events that happened after they were sent.            One report, dated June 2016, claims that the Kremlin has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years, with the aim of encouraging “splits and divisions in western alliance”.      It claims that Trump had declined “various sweetener real estate deals offered him in Russia” especially in developments linked to the 2018 World Cup finals but that “he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.”      Most explosively, the report alleges: “FSB has compromised Trump through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him.” The president-elect has not responded to the allegations.      The story of the Trump dossier: secret sources, an airport handoff, and John McCain Read more      CNN reported on Tuesday that the FBI was still investigating the credibility of the documents but added that the intelligence chiefs had included a summary of the material in a secret briefing on Russian interference in the election delivered last week to Barack Obama and Donald Trump.      The emergence of the documents is potentially explosive, 10 days before Trump’s inauguration and on the eve of his first planned press conference since July last year.      Despite glowing references from US and foreign officials who have worked with the source, there are some errors in the reports. One describes the Moscow suburb of Barvikha as “reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates”, but although it is a very expensive neighbourhood, there are no restrictions on who can own property there. The document also misspells the name of a Russian banking corporation.      The FBI does not normally make any comment on ongoing counter-intelligence investigations but was under increasing pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to act before the inauguration, particularly because of Comey’s announcement of a continuing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server 11 days before the election, which many of her supporters believe cost her the presidency.            The reports were initially commissioned as opposition research during the presidential campaign, but its author was sufficiently alarmed by what he discovered to send a copy to the FBI. It is unclear who within the organisation they reached and what action the bureau took. The former Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, has lambasted Comey for publicising investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private server, while allegedly sitting on “explosive” material on Trump’s ties to Russia.      Another Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, questioned Comey insistently at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday on whether the FBI was pursuing leads on Trump campaign contacts with Russia.      “Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships?” Wyden asked.      Comey replied: “I would never comment on investigations … in a public forum.      The Guardian can confirm that the documents reached the top of the FBI by December. Senator John McCain, who was informed about the existence of the documents separately by an intermediary from a western allied state, dispatched an emissary overseas to meet the source and then decided to present the material to Comey in a one-on-one meeting on 9 December, according to a source aware of the meeting. The documents, which were first reported on last year by Mother Jones, are also in the hands of officials in the White House.      James Comey refuses to tell Senate if FBI is investigating Trump-Russia links Read more      McCain is not thought to have made a judgment on the reliability of the documents but was sufficiently impressed by the source’s credentials to feel obliged to pass them to the FBI.      The Senate armed services committee, which Senator McCain chairs, launched an inquiry last week into Russian cyber-attacks during the election.      McCain was reluctant to get involved, according to a colleague, for fear the issue would be dismissed as a personal grudge against Trump. He pushed instead for the creation of a special Senate committee to look into connections between campaign staff and Moscow, but the proposal was blocked by the Republican leadership.      McCain told the NBC programme Meet the Press on Sunday: “I would like to see a select committee. Apparently that is not in agreement by our leadership. So we will move forward with the armed services committee and I’m sure foreign relations and intelligence committee will as well.”      But the senator added: “It is possible if enough information comes out, that that decision could be reversed. I still think it’s the best way to attack the issue.”      Asked on the same programme on whether an investigation was ongoing into campaign links to Moscow, Senator Lindsey Graham, another conservative Republican said: “I believe that it’s happening.”      According to the report passed to Comey, Russian intelligence allegedly gathered compromising material during Trump’s stay in Moscow in November 2013, when he was in the city to host the Miss Universe pageant.            Another report, dated 19 July last year said that Carter Page, a businessman named by Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers, had held a secret meeting that month with Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft state-owned oil company and a long-serving lieutenant of Vladimir Putin. Page also allegedly met Igor Divyekin, an internal affairs official with a background in intelligence, who is said to have warned Page that Moscow had “kompromat” (compromising material) on Trump.      Two months later, allegations of Page’s meetings surfaced in the US media, attributed to intelligence sources, along with reports that he had been under FBI scrutiny.      Page, a vociferous supporter of the Kremlin line, was in Moscow in July to make a speech decrying western policy towards Russia. At the time he declined to say whether he had been in contact with Russian officials, but in September he rejected the reports as “garbage”.      The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation.      A month after Trump’s surprise election victory, Page was back in Moscow saying he was meeting with “business leaders and thought leaders”, dismissing the FBI investigation as a “witch-hunt” and suggesting the Russian hacking of the Democratic Party alleged by US intelligence agencies, could be a false flag operation to incriminate Moscow.      Another of the reports compiled by the former western counter-intelligence official in July said that members of Trump’s team, which was led by campaign manager Paul Manafort (a former consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine), had knowledge of the DNC hacking operation, and in return “had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/Nato defence commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine”.      A few days later, Trump raised the possibility that his administration might recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea and openly called on Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails.      In August, officials from the Trump campaign intervened in the drafting of the Republican party platform, specifically to remove a call for lethal assistance to Ukraine for its battle against Moscow-backed eastern rebels.      Trump campaign denies report of Trump Organization tie to Russian bank Read more      Manafort stepped down in August as campaign manager and the campaign steadily distanced itself from Page. However, Trump’s praise of Putin and defence of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Syria remained one of the few constants in his campaign talking points.      Manafort has denied secret links with Moscow calling the allegation “an outrageous smear being driven by Harry Reid and the Clinton campaign”.      Since then, Trump has consistently cast doubt on Russian culpability for hacking the Democratic National Committee, defying a consensus of 17 national intelligence agencies. After Obama deported 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for Moscow’s intervention, Trump praised Putin for not carrying out tit-for-tat deportations of US diplomats. “I always knew he was very smart,” he tweeted.      An FBI spokesman declined to comment after the CNN report.       ||||| Normally, Twitter loses its mind over something President-elect Donald Trump has tweeted. This evening, it’s losing its mind over an unverified, leaked report that supposedly details the ways in which Russia has been alternately teaming up with Trump and working to collect compromising information about him. The allegations contained in it are startling. Among them: Trump has been filmed with Russian prostitutes, knew about Russian hacking, and changed his policy on the Ukraine for Russia, and on and on.      US intelligence agencies and multiple journalists haven’t verified these claims to a sufficient degree that they feel comfortable publishing them. And yet here we are, reading them anyway. And making jokes about golden showers on Twitter related to our next president. What is even going on here?      Let’s start with what has taken this report out of the realm of gossip and allegation amongst in-the-know reporters and into your Twitter feed. According to CNN, both Trump and President Obama were given a briefing that included a synopsis of this larger, 35-page report. The ostensible reason for the two-page synopsis that they received was “to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington,” according to CNN. The New York Times reports that “Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence.”      In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it.      That took the newsworthiness of the report up a level, and so BuzzFeed followed an almost identical logic and published the 35-page report itself. Its justification for doing so, knowing that the allegations contained therein are unverified, is “so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.”      In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it.      That reason for publishing is often not only enough, but more than enough to merit publication (cf. this very article). According to BuzzFeed, “the documents have circulated for months, and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials.” It seems likely that it was going to leak one way or another, so a report that Trump and Obama had been briefed on it was as good a time as any for that to happen.      BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith tweeted out an email he sent to his staff detailing why BuzzFeed chose to publish the document:      Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017      Smith’s take here is more nuanced than simply “people are talking about it.” He’s right that it seems clear that this report is behind some of the more serious allegations that have been thrown around by people at the highest levels of US government. Smith’s line of reasoning is defensible — but not every reporter agrees.      The report itself was apparently compiled by a former British intelligence agent “whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible,” CNN says. We know only that the report is being taken seriously by serious people. But the work of corroborating the allegations in it hasn’t been finished yet, so other journalists who had seen it chose not to publish it.      1. For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations. — David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017      But now that it’s out there, published as a PDF with yellow highlights from an unknown reader, it’s out there. I myself tweeted out one of the most explosive allegations (while also noting one of the most salacious parts), and my Twitter notifications are blowing up. The report seems custom-designed to spread on Twitter. It practically begs you to screencap and Tweet whatever part outrages you the most (or makes you titter the most).      These soundbites have been weaponized by Twitter, made all the more powerful because they appeal to the deepest desires and fears of Trump’s critics. After months — and years — of watching damning leaks about Hillary Clinton, finally there’s a leak for the other side to share and spread, provenance be damned.      FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017      It’s not “Fake News,” as Donald Trump just declared on Twitter, because the real news here is that Trump himself was briefed on the contents of this report. It’s unverified news, which is an entirely different thing that requires that you pay attention to where it came from, why, and how.      It’s not necessarily bad that this report is out there — but we should keep in mind that lots of people have been reading and trying to verify these claims for months now. But as it spreads on Twitter, screenshot by gleefully outraged screenshot, it’s going to be stripped of nuance and context.      But we’ll still share and reply and retweet and joke. Because people are talking about it, and that’s the way we talk now. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Top intelligence officials last week told President-elect Donald Trump about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him, a U.S. official said Tuesday.      The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.      The briefing about the document was first reported by CNN. A summary of the allegations was separate from a classified assessment of Russia's attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential election. Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week.      Shortly after news reports were published about the briefing, Trump tweeted: \\"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\\"      Trump was expected to hold a previously scheduled news conference Wednesday to discuss his future plans regarding his role with the Trump Organization.      The unsubstantiated dossier on Trump was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative as part of an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client who opposed Trump, and later funded by Democrats, according to Mother Jones, which published an article about the report in October and said the operative had turned over the report to the FBI. The New York Times reported the operative had previously worked for British intelligence. The Associated Press has not been able to substantiate the information in the dossier, which misspelled the name of Russia's largest bank.      It's unclear why the intelligence officials decided to brief the president and Trump on the uncorroborated information at this time, but lawmakers and others have repeatedly noted that Russia collects intelligence on both Democrats and Republicans.      \\"The Russians also hacked systems associated with the Republicans. They just chose not to release that material yet,\\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Tuesday. \\"There's nothing that prevents them from doing so at a time of their choosing in the future.\\"      Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview Tuesday on NBC's \\"Late Night with Seth Meyers\\" that \\"nobody has sourced it. They're all unnamed, unspoken sources in the story.\\" She said it may have originated with a Russian investigator or groups that wanted Hillary Clinton to win the White House.      The report had been circulating in Washington for months. In October, former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wrote the FBI asking the bureau to publicly disclose what it knew about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Reid was aware of the dossier before he wrote the letter, according to a person knowledgeable about the subject who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.      FBI Director James Comey refused earlier Tuesday to say whether the FBI was investigating any possible ties between Russia and Trump's presidential campaign, citing policy not to comment on what the FBI might or might not be doing.      Comey was pressed by Democrats on the committee about whether the FBI was conducting an investigation. There was no mention during the hearing about the summary of the dossier, which was attached to the classified hacking assessment.      \\"I would never comment on investigations — whether we have one or not — in an open forum like this so I can't answer one way or another,\\" Comey told the panel during his first public appearance before Congress since the election. In late October, Comey angered Democrats when he announced 11 days before the election that the FBI was looking at more emails as part of its investigation of Hillary Clinton.      Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said the American people had a right to know about whether there is an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia.      An active FBI investigation of the next president for ties between his campaign and a nation accused of meddling in the presidential election could further stoke mistrust in the legitimacy of the democratic process. It could also put Trump's own FBI in the awkward position of examining the conduct of those closest to the commander-in-chief.      The FBI was among three U.S. intelligence agencies that collaborated on last week's report on Russia's election activity. It tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to the hacking of email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats like Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It said there was no evidence the Russians tampered with vote tallies; the agencies said they couldn't assess if Russia succeeded in influencing Americans to vote for Trump.      Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who opposed Trump in the GOP primary, said Russia's activity wasn't guided by its support for Trump, but rather \\"to influence and to potentially manipulate American public opinion for the purpose of discrediting individual political figures, sowing chaos and division in our politics, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of our elections.\\"      Democrats at the committee hearing focused their toughest questions on Comey, who was widely criticized for breaking FBI policy in his decision to notify Congress about additional information that came up related to Clinton. He is in the fourth year of a 10-year term, meaning he is expected to stay on in the Trump administration.      Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Comey set a new standard by discussing the bureau's activity related to Clinton's private email server. That standard, she said, is the FBI discusses ongoing investigations when there is a \\"unique public interest in the transparency of that issue.\\"      The intelligence agencies' findings on Russian hacking fit that standard, she argued.      \\"I'm not sure I can think of an issue of more serious public interest than this one,\\" Harris said. \\"This committee needs to understand what the FBI does and does not know about campaign communications with Russia.\\"      Sitting beside Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, \\"Fair point.\\"      ___      Associated Press writer Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week's intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing.      A summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, the official said. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information \\"outside that meeting.\\"      A 35-page memorandum published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats.      Related: Seth Meyers Confronts Conway Over Trump Allegations      Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum — unverified by American intelligence agencies — about his dealings with the Russians.      Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an \\"annex,\\" or addendum, included in the \\"supporting documents\\" that accompanied the classified briefing report.      While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary.      “Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,” the senior official said.      According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted “disinformation.”      The briefers also had available to them unvetted “disinformation” about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump.      The Russian government on Wednesday denied reports that it has compromising information about Trump, dismissing the claims as a \\"total hoax.\\"      Amid increased interest in the dossier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected all of the allegations out of hand. Trump later blamed intelligence agencies for allowing the dossier to leak, tweeting: \\"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\\"      \\"The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump,\\" Peskov said, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. \\"It's a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information.\\"      Peskov also called the reports \\"pulp fiction.\\"      Trump did not respond to the reports directly but sent a tweet appearing to refer to it on Tuesday night.      Early Wednesday, he sent several others that followed Peskov's comments.      Trump has repeatedly cast doubt over findings by American intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the U.S. election with the aim of helping him win.      NBC News reported last week that the gulf between Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies had grown so wide that the two camps couldn't even agree on the scheduled date of a briefing Trump had been due to receive.      Related: Putin's Sassy Trolling Sent Message to Trump, Experts Say      Peskov mentioned Trump's initial tweet, and went on to say that some people were “boosting the hysteria and go to any lengths to maintain this state of 'witch hunting.'”      Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, told NBC News he was sure Russian officials were \\"thrilled\\" to see Americans bickering about the leaked memo. \\"It doesn't make us look like we are a healthy democracy.\\"      McFaul also said that Trump had contributed to an atmosphere in which \\"fake news\\" could flourish because of his past promotion of the unfounded \\"birther\\" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birthplace.      In an interview with NBC News before his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago, Obama said he had not seen the news accounts of Trump's Russian ties but noted that \\"as a matter of principle and national security, I don't comment on classified information.\\"      Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election.      The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe \\"with a high level of confidence\\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign.      Trump has been skeptical about the alleged Russian hacks, even as he repeatedly praised Putin. ||||| Summary:","output":"Documents allegedly showing secret contact between Moscow's intelligence and US President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign have been passed to FBI director James Comey by Senator John McCain, according to The Guardian. The papers, which were commissioned as opposition research, were first reported by Mother Jones last year and have also been viewed by the Obama administration. The contents of the papers have not been verified, but their source has previously been described as having a reputation for Russian contacts.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

Police In contrast, the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions. To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded. This would, for example, allow police to establish a restaurant guest's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table. Q: What could be impeded without police interference?","output":"A: Without police interference in certain situations, the realization of the private right would be impeded.

First question: \\"Is IAS above the level of DM just a glorified clerk to a politician?\\" IAS stands for Indian Administrative Service, and DM means District Magistrate.

They have many more responsibilities, like taking care of the community's needs and solving problems. Second question: \\"How long does an IAS officer serves as DM?\\" An IAS officer, who is like a big helper, can be a DM, or District Magistrate, for different amounts of time. Sometimes, they are DM for few years, and sometimes for a little longer. It depends on how good they are at their job and whether they need to move to a different job to help more people.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Wait until the leaf buds begin to swell, then use a sturdy, sharp blade to ensure a clean cut. Prune by cutting at a 45-degree angle, just above an outer-facing growth bud. Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow.  Pruning above an outer-facing growth bud encourages the roses to grow outward, rather than inward, which can reduce air circulation and lessen the visual appeal of the bush. Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems. If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about ⅓ of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less. Cut this back until you see a healthy white center to the stem. Your aim is to have a plant where growth is well spaced out to encourage the flow and circulation of air. Remove close growing stems and any that cross or are tangled. On older plants you can cut back any old wood growth that no longer produces any new stems. Summary:","output":"Wait until the small parts of the tree where new branches grow (we call these leaf buds) start to get bigger, then cut these using a sharp tool. Cut at a diagonal, or slanted, angle above a spot on the rose stem that's going to grow outwards. This helps the roses to grow outwards and not inwards, making the rose bush look nicer and healthier. Do not cut your new rose bush for the first two years after you've planted it. Only cut the rose bush once it has grown a lot. Depending on how big or small you want your rose bush to be, you should cut a little or a lot of it. Always cut until you see the inside of the stem is white and healthy. Your goal is to have a bush where branches are not too close to each other, this helps the air to move around the plant better. Also, remove branches that are too close or tangled with other branches. On older plants, you can cut branches that don't have new growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Long after its introduction into the New World, American English was still considered non-standard English. According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous  rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English.

I have brought visiting family members here for everything from t-shirts to expensive jewelry items. The staff is helpful and friendly. The owner, \\"Hong\\", however - is not. She has a major attitude and has been rude and insulting on more than one occasion. I have had her follow me around like a suspected shoplifter when needing to try on a \\"Double D Ranchwear\\" t-shirt. It isn't my fault the only dressing room is in another area of the store, and \\"Lucita\\" already knew who I was/what I was trying on. Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present.  Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item.  Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case.  My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise,  so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family.  Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists.

Life Is Hot In Cracktown could perhaps have been something worthwhile in the right hands. But this clearly low-budget endeavor falls short of anything worth your time. The shortcomings of this film are many, but chief among them are tortoise like plot development, one dimensional characters and amateurish editing. The story isn't new.

Information:  - Hugo Christiaan Hamaker ( 23 March 1905 , Broek op Langedijk , North Holland -- 7 September 1993 , Eindhoven ) was a Dutch scientist , who was responsible for the Hamaker theory which explains the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules . His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology .  - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper.  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden.  - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900  March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions.   - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of .  - Broek op Langedijk (West Frisian: \\"Broek op Lengedìk\\") is a town in the Netherlands, located in the municipality of Langedijk in the province of North Holland.  - North Holland (, West Frisian: \\"Noard-Holland\\") is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of .  - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive.  - Eindhoven is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands, originally at the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant.  - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.  Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".    What entity does 'hugo christiaan hamaker' has the relation 'occupation' with?","output":"Hugo Christiaan Hamaker was occupied in several roles throughout his life, with the most prominent ones being his work as a scientist and a professor. His scientific career mainly revolved around the exploration of forces between molecules, which had ultimately led to the formulation of the now well-recognized Hamaker theory explaining the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules. This occupation involved his dealing with the intricate details of molecule interactions and the formation of an advanced and generalized version of the van der Waals theory. The essentiality of his work can be proven by the heavy citation of his 1937 paper. Moreover, Hamaker was associated with the esteemed institutions like Universiteit Utrecht, the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and Eindhoven University of Technology, offering him various platforms to showcase and utilise his profound knowledge and skills in the field of science.  He completed his doctorate under the mentorship of Leonard Ornstein at Universiteit Utrecht in 1934, the dissertation of which was titled \\"Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way\\", demonstrating his scientific prowess. Hamaker's occupation also involved his tenure at the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven, which lasted from 1934 to 1967. This role supplemented his experience and understanding of the practical implementations and implications of theoretical scientific principles. Following this, Hamaker served as a Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1960 to 1972. Here, he was responsible for disseminating his knowledge and expertise to the next generation of scientists and expanding the horizons of their understanding of the field. Therefore, the entity that Hugo Christiaan Hamaker has the relation 'occupation' with is his various roles in the field of science: a scientist mainly exploring the nature of van der Waals forces, a graduate student at Universiteit Utrecht, a professional at the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and later, a professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When she was told it was Alfred Hitchcock who, while he was watching The Today Show, saw her in a commercial for a diet drink called Sego, she agreed to sign a seven-year contract. During their first meeting, the two talked about everything except the role he was considering her for. Hedren was convinced for several weeks it was for his television series, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Hitchcock later said, \\"I was not primarily concerned with how she looked in person. Most important was her appearance on the screen, and I liked that immediately. She has a touch of that high-style, lady-like quality which was once well-represented in films by actresses like Irene Dunne, Grace Kelly, Claudette Colbert, and others but which is now quite rare.\\"  Hitchcock put Hedren through an extensive color screen test that lasted two days and cost 25,000, doing scenes from his previous films, such as Rebecca, Notorious and To Catch a Thief with actor Martin Balsam. According to Balsam, Hedren was very nervous but studied every line, did every move she was asked to, and tried to do everything right. Hitchcock asked costume designer Edith Head to design clothes for Hedren's private life and he personally advised her about wine and food. He also insisted for publicity purposes that her name should be printed only in single quotes, 'Tippi'. The press mostly ignored this directive from the director, who felt that the single quotes added distinction and mystery to her name. Hitchcock was impressed with Hedren. As production designer Robert F. Boyle explained, \\"Hitch always liked women who behaved like well-bred ladies. Tippi generated that quality.\\"  Afterward, Hedren was invited to lunch with Hitchcock, his wife, Alma, and Lew Wasserman, head of Universal, at one of Hitchcock's favorite restaurants, Chasen's. There she was presented with a golden pin of three birds in flight, adorned by three tiny seed pearls, and was asked by Hitchcock to play the leading role in his upcoming film The Birds. \\"I was so stunned.

Art Spiegelman (; born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus. His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Spiegelman was born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev in Stockholm, Sweden, on February 15, 1948. He immigrated with his parents to the US in 1951. Upon immigration his name was registered as Arthur Isadore, but he later had his given name changed to Art. Initially the family settled in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and then relocated to Rego Park in Queens, New York City, in 1957. He began cartooning in 1960 and imitated the style of his favorite comic books, such as Mad. At Russell Sage Junior High School, where he was an honors student, he produced the Mad-inspired fanzine Blase. He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original Long Island Press and other outlets. His talent was such that he caught the eyes of United Features Syndicate, who offered him the chance to produce a syndicated comic strip. Dedicated to the idea of art as expression, he turned down this commercial opportunity. He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963. He met Woody Gelman, the art director of Topps Chewing Gum Company, who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating high school. At 15 Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper.  After his graduation in 1965, Spiegelman's parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry, but he chose instead to enroll at Harpur College to study art and philosophy. While there, he got a freelance art job at Topps, which provided him with an income for the next two decades.  Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968, where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine. After a summer internship when he was 18, Topps hired him for Gelman's Product Development Department as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966, such as the Wacky Packages series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967.  Spiegelman began selling self-published underground comix on street corners in 1966. He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the East Village Other and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967, where the underground comix scene was just beginning to burgeon.  In late winter 1968 Spiegelman suffered a brief but intense nervous breakdown, which cut his university studies short. He has said that at the time he was taking LSD with great frequency. He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital, and shortly after he got out his mother committed suicide following the death of her only surviving brother.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would patient B produce more or less insulin than patient A?  Rob is studying medicine in a prestigious university. Today, his professor is teaching about blood glucose levels. He gave example of two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance.  Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's review the information given: 1. Patient A has a high blood glucose level. 2. Patient B has a low blood glucose level. 3. When blood glucose levels are high, the pancreas secretes insulin. 4. When blood glucose levels are low, less insulin is produced, and glucagon is produced instead. Based on this information, Patient A has a high blood glucose level and therefore the pancreas would secrete insulin to lower it. Patient B has a low blood glucose level, so less insulin would be produced for them. The answer is: Patient B would produce less insulin than Patient A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One playset represents North America, and the other one represents South America. Each playset has lots of roads and tiny toy cars driving on them. Now, there's a space or a gap between these two playsets. This gap is called the Darien Gap. It exists because there are no roads or bridges connecting the two playsets, like an area without any toy roads at all.  The Darien Gap is a big forest and swampy area where it's really hard to build roads. So, the toy cars from the North America playset can't easily drive to the South America playset and vice versa. In summary, the gap between North and South American road systems is called the Darien Gap, and it's like a big area without any toy roads connecting two big car playsets."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long. Problem:In 1990, Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which extended federal civil rights protections to people with mental or physical impairments: The ADA is one of America’s most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life — to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in State and local government programs and services. Modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin – and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — the ADA is an “equal opportunity” law for people with disabilities. More than a quarter-century on, and despite further work to be done, the ADA has so positively affected how people with disabilities are treated and perceived in America that the notion that laws once existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable. But it was the case — and not so long ago. Beginning in the late 1800s, statutes known as “unsightly beggar ordinances,” aka “ugly laws,” were enacted in some American cities to rid public spaces of what Chicago Alderman James Peevey euphemistically referred to as “street obstructions”: By street obstructions, Peevey didn’t mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes. He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as “the one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies” or “the fellows who yell ‘ba-na-naas'” and “the woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds ‘Mollie Darling’ incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.” Following the example of San Francisco, which had pioneered the legislation in 1867, Peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines (or stints in the poorhouse) on all who were “diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object,” yet dared beg, panhandle, or otherwise make nuisances of themselves in public. Among other cities, Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon followed suit, all passing ugly laws using virtually identical language. In a discussion of Susan M. Schweik’s The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public (2009), reviewer Shannon Sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to these measures: Schweik discusses in detail several factors which combined to create the perfect storm for the emergence of ugly law in America at this time. These include: the formation of Charity Organization Societies, the rise or eugenics and state institutions, an increasing focus on using urban planning to create beautiful cities, increasing immigration at a time when there were few restrictions placed on immigration, the large number of soldiers injured in the Civil War which had ended just a few years earlier, temperance and prohibition, and the increasing industrialization of society with resulting industrial-related injuries. Schweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of World War I and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter, they remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century: Schweik found that the last known arrest under an ugly law occurred in Omaha, NE in 1974 when a policeman wanted to arrest a homeless man but had no basis for arrest. After searching the city code and finding that Omaha’s Ugly Law was still on the books he was able to take the man into custody on the basis that the man had “marks and scars on his body.” Prosecutors refused to press charges in this case. Schweik recounts one prosecutor pointing out that “criminal prosecution under this law would require the impossible: courtroom proof “that someone is ugly.” Solution:","output":"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, is a comprehensive civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and guarantees equal opportunities in employment, access to goods and services, and participation in state and local government programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was actually thrown through Herman Boone's window in real life? Movie title: Remember the Titans Movie plot: It's 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia and successful high school football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has just been deprived of the head coaching job at the new integrated T.C. Williams High School to make way for equally successful black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans. Thus, they are prepared to pursue the State Championship and to deal with an unthinkable tragedy that threatens to sink their perfect season.Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison, Ryan Gosling, Hayden Panettiere, and Kate Bosworth co-star.This makes for a good story, but not totally true. Northern Virginia Schools, which consist of Arlington and Fairfax County, the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church Schools were already integrated when T.C. Williams HS was built and opened. Langley HS, McLean Va, (Home of the Langley Saxons) which opened in 1966 had the first Black / African American Football Coach Charles Price, who later went to Groveton HS after developing a successful football program at Langley.

Article: Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation, today issued a statement calling for Facebook and Google to subsidize the news traveling through their platforms.      In the statement, Murdoch calls on Facebook to pay a carriage fee, as cable companies do with pay TV, to trusted publishers that are posting their content on the social media platform:      I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize ‘trusted’ publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services.      This comes fresh on the heels of a change to Facebook’s News Feed algorithm, which prioritizes posts from friends and family over those from publishers and content providers. Facebook said that the change was meant to increase well-being among users, offering a more proactive way to build a community and positive sentiment across the network.      But Wall Street didn’t react well to the change, which Facebook predicted would decrease time spent on the network, which ultimately will decrease the time users spend looking at advertisements.      As part of the announcement, Facebook’s News Feed chief Adam Mosseri didn’t have many concrete suggestions for publishers worried about decreased visibility on the world’s biggest social media platform, simply saying publishers should try “experimenting … and seeing … what content gets more comments, more likes, more reshares.”      This also follows an ongoing situation around news credibility on social networks like Facebook. The spread of fake news across the internet, most noticeably on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, may very well have changed the course of the 2016 election. Whether it was sparked and spread by foreign actors like Russia or domestic political groups, it has forced Facebook to try to remedy the situation over the past year.      Facebook’s original entry into the world of media, the launch of Instant Articles in 2015, has spurred voracious consumption of news on the platform. Pew says that around two-thirds of U.S. adults get their news from social media sites, with 20 percent saying they do so often.      This has disenfranchised many publishers who require a direct connection with readers to maintain credibility. If all articles look the same, and many “readers” are looking at an entirely different “front page” on Facebook, establishing the one and only truth of any matter becomes more difficult.      And let’s not forget that the media industry is in its own, continued transformation as century-old print publications try to move digital.      Murdoch, one of the most successful people in news media, doesn’t see much progress with new business models such as subscriptions and pay walls, but does see an opportunity in making the pipes pay.      An unrealistic proposal      However, on closer inspection his suggestion is disingenuous. To publicly issue a carefully scripted statement with questionable insinuations (Facebook is equated to a cable provider) and very few details is more mud-slinging than muckraking. We’re not saying Facebook shouldn’t be paying somebody something, but this isn’t a realistic solution and I don’t think Murdoch really believes it is either.      Carriage fees are pretty simple. Your cable provider pays a fee per subscriber to networks like ESPN and AMC in order to carry their programming; these fees vary from under a dollar for specialty or less popular networks (AMC, FX) to more than 6 (ESPN, by far the most expensive). The idea is that you as a subscriber are paying for access to these channels, and then paying for the convenience of having them delivered to your TV by the cable company. The 40-50 is really only routed through the cable companies for convenience (yours and theirs).      But while that makes sense for a cable provider with millions of subscribers in a single region of the U.S., all paying 50 or more for the privilege of watching live TV, it’s a poor match for the likes of Facebook.      Facebook’s “viewers,” just off the top of my head:      are all over the world in different regions and jurisdictions      don’t choose what they see (nor does Facebook, arguably)      pay nothing      are already monetized indirectly by both Facebook and publishers      If Facebook pays a carriage fee for the privilege of carrying content from the Hindustan Times, and it shows up as a Facebook Instant Article in an American’s news feed because a British PR firm paid for it to be promoted, because it wants to drive subscribers, and it does… who exactly owes whom what? Who is paying what, for what? Who determines what is “trusted,” and what would happen to sources that aren’t “trusted”? Should Facebook literally pay every site a fee for every one of its billion (or however many) users, for the possibility that someday, some item may show up in any of those users’ feeds?      You can see that this quickly descends into chaos. Murdoch’s suggestion is a horse and buggy solution for a company working on self-driving cars.      Clearly something else is needed. Facebook is raking in cash and is confident that companies like Murdoch’s can’t survive without the reach that social media provides. Why would it as an ostensibly objective platform for users to post content attempt what is “trusted” and then pay them for the title?      Supposedly, trusted publishers pay for promotion on the platform and receive value in the form of readers, who view their ads and may eventually buy a subscription. Of course, Facebook undermines this value proposition all the time and publishers are upset at their emasculation and inability to dictate terms, as many have for decades.      No one has a solution for the very real problem of modern media monetization, but Murdoch’s suggestion is worse than most. Publishers lost the last few rounds by clinging to the past, they’re not going to win the next one or even force a draw by doubling down and making empty threats with non-existent leverage.      You can read Murdoch’s full statement below: ||||| Statement of Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp, on a Carriage Fee for Trusted Publishers      News Corp today issued the following statement from Executive Chairman, Rupert Murdoch:      “Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically.      There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook’s strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms.      The time has come to consider a different route. If Facebook wants to recognize ‘trusted’ publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies. The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook’s profits but a major impact on the prospects for publishers and journalists.”      #      About News Corp      News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) is a global, diversified media and information services company focused on creating and distributing authoritative and engaging content to consumers throughout the world.

Today, we are going to talk about two brothers named Ronde and Tiki Barber. They used to play a big and important game called football. Do you like football? It's so much fun! Ronde and Tiki Barber were really good at this game. They played it for many years and became very famous. Many people loved watching them play and cheered for them. Ronde played as a helper called a \\"defender\\" to stop the other team from scoring points. Tiki played as a runner called a \\"running back\\" who tried to run with the ball and score points for his team. One day, Tiki decided that he didn't want to play football anymore. He wanted to try new things and talk about football on TV instead. That's okay! Sometimes people want to do different things in their lives. It's good to try new activities, isn't it? But some people were not happy with Tiki's decision. They thought that he should keep playing football because he was so good at it. They even stopped loving him as much as they did before. Ronde, the good brother he is, wanted to help Tiki. He knew that his brother was a really nice person and a great football player. Ronde believed that one day, people would love Tiki again. He thought that if Tiki kept working hard and being a good person, people would remember how amazing he was and start loving him once more! So Ronde Barber keeps supporting Tiki, and Tiki keeps working hard and doing his best. We can learn something from the Barber brothers. We should never give up on our dreams and always believe in ourselves and each other. And guess what? Ronde was right! Tiki is now loved by many people again, just like before. Sometimes it takes time for people to see the good in others, but love and support can make a big difference! I hope you enjoyed learning about Ronde and Tiki Barber, two fantastic football players and brothers. Remember, kids, being a good friend and believing in each other is very important. And who knows? Maybe one day, you will be just like Ronde and Tiki, playing your favorite game and being loved by many people, too!"},{"instruction":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did the Valide Sultan rule?\\" is in \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\".

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If less coal is available for the steam engine, it will directly affect the power produced by the engine. Here's an explanation of how the process would be impacted: 1. With less coal loaded into the firebox, there will be less fuel to burn. This will result in a smaller fire and reduced heat generation. 2. As a consequence of the lowered heat production, the water in the boiler will not be heated to the same extent, causing less steam to be produced under high pressure. 3. With lower steam pressure available, the steam flowing into the cylinder will have less force to push the tight-fitting plunger (piston) forward. 4. As the piston receives less force, the connecting crank and rod system will not be able to push as hard, and the wheels will not turn as effectively. This will cause the locomotive to move at a slower pace (less power). 5. Consequently, the piston's ability to expel the steam back through the cylinder and up the chimney will also be affected, as there is less force and pressure to drive this process. In summary, the perturbation of having less coal directly impacts the steam engine's power output, as it leads to reduced heat generation, lesser steam pressure, and a consequent decrease in locomotive efficiency and power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The build-up has been years in the making. From the cartoons that many of us watched as children, we envisioned a world where machines and robots would penetrate every aspect of our lives, where each household would have a Rosie the Robot to cook, clean, and put the kids to bed. Well, for most of us that washed our own dishes last night, we know that we are not there yet. The questions are: why aren't we there yet and when will we get there? Well, the world of machines is real and it's coming. Many refer to it as Machine-to-Machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, or the Industrial Internet. All of these terms describe the same thing: automated technology that allows machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit. This exchange of information is rapidly changing the way we work and live. You likely benefit from this technology every day without even knowing it. M2M applications are guiding you in your connected vehicles to the nearest Starbucks, or allowing you to remotely monitor your home from a smartphone. The applications bleed even more heavily into the enterprise space where companies are using M2M solutions to do everything from tracking the position of a high-value asset traveling through Europe to controlling the flow rate of an oil pipeline in North Dakota from an office in New York. Read related: 7 craziest things connected to the internet. So, with this technology available, why aren't we there yet? Why isn't M2M permeating every aspect of our business and personal lives yet? And, more importantly, why am I still doing my own dishes? Well, it is not due to lack of demand. Analysts and industry experts project that the Internet of Things will grow from connecting about 100 million devices today to more than two billion devices by 2021 -- representing a staggering 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Do I think that this type of growth will become a reality? Yes, but there are a couple of complexities that will first need to be worked out. As a matter of fact, complexity is the first of two threats to M2M growth. Many enterprise M2M solutions require months, if not years, and a significant financial commitment to get to deployment. With those daunting hurdles facing many technology decision makers, and despite an average return on investment at around 40%, companies are deferring their M2M strategies. Obviously, this has to change in order for M2M to reach its immense promise. We need to get to a point where implementing an M2M strategy involves a matter of hours or days instead of months and years. When that is a reality, then we will start to see the realization of what M2M can be for both enterprise and consumer use. Read related: Cisco's new, smarter network for the Internet of things. The second threat to M2M growth has to do with the shift in the mobile industry towards 3G and 4G networks. At first glance, that seems a bit odd. How could enhancing the technology that M2M sits on pose a threat to its very future? As mobile carriers negotiate with limited spectrum to support 4G rollouts, 2G networks are often sacrificed. The problem created is that M2M applications not only lose support, but they face significant expenses to enter into a 3G or 4G system where their data usage does not come close to justifying the costs, not to mention the significant capital investment required for a pricey 3G or 4G compatible device. Although I believe that M2M applications will evolve to a point where a 4G network will make sense, I don't believe that we are there yet, nor will we be there for at least a couple more years. Thus, 2G will have to remain an integral part of the growth of the industry for the time being, and fortunately there are carriers that have pledged ongoing support for 2G. As momentum for the proliferation of the Internet of Things builds to forecasted levels and enterprises and individuals enter this brave new world, there will be some bumps along the road. However, it will be a much smoother and quicker ride into the future if application providers can find easy-to-implement solutions supported by networks that meet their tactical and financial objectives. When we get to that point, then you might just be able to kick back a little and let Rosie handle things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Horn. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. The world of machines, or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology, is evolving rapidly, allowing machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit in daily life and work. 2.

Implementing an M2M strategy currently takes months or years, but when this is reduced to hours or days, the potential of M2M will be realized for enterprise and consumer use. 4. The shift to 3G and 4G networks creates a problem for M2M applications, as they face significant expenses and lose support in this transition. 5.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described is the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. To better understand this process, let's break down the individual steps mentioned and examine them more closely: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When water, either in the form of liquid, vapor, or droplets, comes into contact with an iron surface, it sets the stage for a chemical reaction to occur. This reaction is the first step towards the formation of rust. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: As water is exposed to the surrounding air, it absorbs carbon dioxide. This dissolved carbon dioxide then reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is now present on the iron surface and starts reacting with it. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The carbonic acid reacts with the iron, causing it to dissolve slowly. The dissolution of iron leads to the formation of ferrous ions (Fe2+). 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: In the presence of carbonic acid and dissolved iron, water molecules can break down into their constituent elements: hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The hydrogen may either escape as gas, or it may react with other species present, such as oxygen to form water again. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: The free oxygen present reacts with the dissolved iron (Fe2+) to form iron oxide or rust (Fe2O3·nH2O). This compound is reddish-brown and is typically what we associate with rust. In conclusion, the final step of this process is the formation of iron oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O) or rust, which is a result of the reaction between free oxygen and dissolved iron (Fe2+) on the iron surface. This process, known as oxidation, causes the iron to corrode and weaken over time, and is a major concern for the maintenance and preservation of iron structures and objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans.

Article: By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views. Question: What was meant by the term saltationism?","output":"Saltationism is an evolutionary theory that posits that new species arise through sudden, large-scale changes or \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation through small, incremental variations. The term is derived from the Latin word \\"saltus,\\" which means \\"leap\\" or \\"jump.\\" This theory emerged during the period referred to as \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when several alternative theories to Charles Darwin's natural selection gained prominence. In contrast to Darwin's theory of gradualism, which emphasizes the slow, continuous, and cumulative process of evolution through the accumulation of small inherited variations, saltationism proposes that evolution can happen rapidly. Proponents of saltationism believed that these significant leaps or jumps led to the formation of new species, often in response to environmental changes and pressures. During the eclipse of Darwinism, saltationism was one of the several alternative theories of evolution that sought to challenge Darwin's original ideas. Other theories included orthogenesis, which proposed that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction regardless of environmental influences, and neo-Lamarckism, which supported the idea that the inheritance of acquired characteristics could lead to evolutionary progress. It is crucial to note that although saltationism offered a different perspective on the mechanisms of evolution, it did not entirely reject the principle of evolution itself. The saltationist viewpoint mainly questioned the dominance of natural selection as the primary driving force behind evolution, rather than opposing the concept of species change over time. With the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work on genetics and the establishment of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory in the mid-20th century, saltationism and other alternative theories lost prominence. The integration of genetics and Darwin's theory of natural selection into a cohesive framework known as neo-Darwinism ultimately superseded them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm-down on your stomach, right below the rib cage.  Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separately and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow, deep breath through your nose by expanding your belly. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. Exhale through your mouth. Do this as often as you can.  Use a variation of a Chinese Qigong breathing exercise. Sit down comfortably. The lungs' natural rhythm will take over immediately. Take three short inhalations through the nose. On the first intake, lift your arms, reaching in front, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the second intake, move your arms to the side, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head. Repeat 10 to 12 times. If either exercise causes any dizziness, stop. Do these exercises as often as you need. Another way to decrease stress and cope with pain is through progressive muscle relaxation. Start with your toes. Tighten them by curling them under your feet. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the toes.  Move on to the feet next. Tighten all the muscles in your feet and hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the feet. Move up through your legs, thighs, abdomen, arms, neck, and face, tightening the muscles in each area. Relax slowly every time. Positive visualization can be a form of meditation. Positive visualization and meditation can help relieve stress, which can help ease discomfort and lessen pain.  Pick a favorite spot and get comfortable. Remember a favorite place. Close your eyes and picture that place. Keep the image in your mind. Breathe deeply as you keep the picture in your mind. Don’t worry if you lose the image. Just take a breath and start again. Until you have some practice, you may need to start again a few times. Try and make sure you do this during a time that you are least likely to get interrupted. Look into doing guided imagery through YouTube videos or apps. Using positive affirmations may be effective in helping change your mentality about the pain and lift your mood. Publically say positive things about yourself and your pain. Positive self-talk can help boost your mental perception of the pain. Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can. Use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are:  Yes, I can. I can get through the pain.  I am getting better. I feel better every day. I can control my pain.

Moses' basket floats downstream, eventually arriving at the royal palace. There, the baby is discovered by Ramesses' own daughter, who is captivated by the infant and vows to raise him as her own. She remains completely unaware of his true Hebrew heritage.

Kwai Answer:","output":"Title: The Return of Kwai Genre: Action-Adventure, Thriller Plot Outline: Frank Thompson, a retired CIA agent, lives a quiet life in rural America. He was known for his remarkable achievements and relentless pursuit of a notorious crime lord, Kwai Zhang. Years ago, Frank singlehandedly brought down Kwai's criminal empire, and the crime lord was believed to be dead after a final confrontation. One stormy night, Frank receives a cryptic message from an unknown source which mentions, \\"Kwai is alive. Your past awaits.\\" Skeptical and disturbed by this information, Frank starts investigating the legitimacy of the message. Frank shares this revelation with his old CIA comrades, but they dismiss it as a prank. However, Frank's instincts tell him otherwise. As Frank digs further, he starts uncovering pieces of evidence suggesting that Kwai survived the earlier confrontation and went underground, rebuilding his criminal empire away from the public eye. Now, more powerful and dangerous than ever, Kwai wants Frank dead as a retribution for destroying his empire. Kwai, having spent years seeking revenge, devises elaborate traps and ambushes for Frank. Frank faces a series of attacks by masked assassins from every corner, all in an attempt to fulfill Kwai's vengeful vendetta. Frank's years of experience and instincts keep him a step ahead of these assassins, surviving their attempted ambushes. As Frank continues to unravel the mystery of Kwai's resurgence, he stumbles upon a conspiracy that implicates some of his former CIA colleagues as double agents working for Kwai. Frank realizes that these double agents were discreetly feeding him false information to make him doubt the solidity of the case against Kwai. With no one to trust, Frank goes rogue to confront and capture Kwai. Along the way, Frank meets Emily, a skilled hacker who shares her own vendetta against Kwai as he was responsible for her brother's murder. They form an uneasy alliance, adding an element of trust and camaraderie to the story. Together, Frank and Emily infiltrate Kwai's new empire, slowly dismantling it piece by piece. Despite facing various challenges and close escapes from Kwai's clutches, Frank remains focused and driven by justice. In the climax, Frank confronts Kwai for the final time. Despite the numerous traps and skilled assassins he encountered all along, Frank manages to outsmart and outmaneuver Kwai. In an intense and gripping fight scene, Frank takes Kwai down, avenging the innocents who suffered at his hands and ultimately putting an end to the crime lord's reign of terror once and for all. As the story concludes, Frank and Emily part ways, having formed a deep bond of mutual respect. Frank returns to his peaceful life but comes out of retirement and works with the CIA again to ensure that nothing like this happens again, while Emily finds closure and seeks a new life. \\"The Return of Kwai\\" is a thrilling action-adventure, filled with dramatic twists and heart-pounding action sequences that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats till the very end."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process involves the bat generating and emitting a series of high-frequency vocalizations, also known as ultrasonic calls or echolocation calls. These vocalizations are produced in the bat's larynx, or voice box, and are emitted through its mouth or nose, depending on the species. The frequency of these calls often ranges between 20 to 200 kHz, well beyond the range of human hearing, which is typically limited to 20 Hz to 20 kHz. These ultrasonic calls serve as the primary source of the sound waves that will later interact with objects in the environment, forming the basis for echolocation. During this initial stage, bats produce calls with specific frequency, intensity, and duration to optimize the detection and localization of potential prey, obstacles, and other environmental features. The detailed characteristics of these calls may vary depending on the bat's species, habitat, and feeding strategy. In summary, the first step in the echolocation process is the generation and emission of high-frequency ultrasonic calls by the bat, which will subsequently propagate as sound waves through the surrounding environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Kissell was signed as an infielder in 1940 by Branch Rickey, and spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. This sentence suggests that: - Kissell was signed by Branch Rickey; - The signing happened in 1940; - Kissell was an infielder; - Kissell spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization. Sentence 2: Kissell was born in 1940 by Branch Rickey as an infielder and spent 69 years with the Cardinals organization.

Samuel liked to sleep in late, but Lawrence made too much noise and woke up","output":"Samuel every morning, much to his chagrin. The cacophony of Lawrence's morning routine resounded through their shared apartment walls— the clattering of pots and pans while preparing breakfast, the aggressive brushing of teeth in the bathroom, the laughter of talkshow hosts from the television, and the energetic blast of music during his workout session. Samuel loved nothing more than to cherish the quiet moments before the sun rose above the horizon, basking in the tranquility found during the twilight hours. He found solace in the hushed whispers of the world before the daily bustle crept up and snatched it away, leaving chaos in its wake. This sacred time allowed him to rejuvenate and organize his thoughts, preparing for the day ahead and the challenges it brought. However, because they shared such close living quarters, Samuel's treasured solitude was disrupted on a daily basis by the onslaught of noise produced by Lawrence. The daily disturbance gnawed away at Samuel's patience as he lay in bed with his pillow smashed against his ears, fruitlessly trying to block out the sounds of his flatmate's energetic activities. With every grating scrape of a knife on toast or the piercing whir of a blender, Samuel's frustration transformed into anger in the dimly-lit room. He wondered how someone could be so blatant in their disruption, ignoring the quiet, contemplative aura of the early morning. This pattern continued for weeks.

News article: Photo      NEW DELHI — The most lost of the lost people of Delhi end up here, in a cold metal-sided room at the Sabzi Mandi mortuary. They are lying on every available surface, including the blood-smeared floor, some with body parts flung out in the position of their death, protruding from the white plastic bags that are used to store them.      The smooth, sharp curve of a man’s naked hip, all bone and no flesh. A jaw, with teeth. Hands folded over an abdomen as if at rest, or extended in some last intercepted expression of feeling.      In a corner, the bodies are crowded together on the floor. The mortuary attendants say it is so difficult to procure supplies as basic as disinfectant from the government that workers bring soap from home so that they can wash their hands after handling the bodies, many of which are infected with tuberculosis. So it would be unrealistic for the unidentified dead to expect a metal shelf of their own.      “You’ll find them one on top of the other,” said the mortuary’s chief doctor, L. C. Gupta. “Where are we supposed to put them?”      On average, the police in this city register the discovery of more than 3,000 unidentifiable bodies a year — unidentifiable not because they are unrecognizable, but because they carry no documents and there is no one who knows them.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      It is an extraordinary number. New York City buries as many as 1,500 homeless or poor people in trenches in its potter’s field on Hart Island every year, but of those, according to an official from the medical examiner’s office who recently spoke to the NY1 news channel, the number who remain unidentified averages around 50.      In Delhi, one regularly encounters the unknown dead: By law, photographs of their corpses must be published in newspapers and posted in police stations, under the Dickensian heading “Hue and Cry Notice.” Protocol requires the mortuary to hold each body for 72 hours so that relatives have a chance to spot the announcements and claim the dead, but Dr. Gupta said they rarely do.      “Nobody reads them,” he said. Police officers are also expected to investigate. Asked about this, Dr. Gupta gave a small, dry smile. “They may or may not try,” he said.      This is no city for the poor. Drive around New Delhi at night, and great numbers of men, women and children can be seen curled up on the sidewalks sleeping, or trying to sleep. These people — “pavement dwellers,” they are called — figure in occasional newspaper articles about drunken drivers whose vehicles jump the curb and plow into a row of sleepers.      The most desperate gather around temples, where observant Hindus are encouraged to distribute food to the poor after a death in the family. Mohammad Yamin, an investigating officer at the Kashmere Gate police station, said families often abandoned terminally ill relatives at the nearby Hanuman temple because they are unable to get them admitted to government hospitals.

But most of the unclaimed dead appear to come from another group: men from distant villages, sent to the city in their teens or 20s to earn money as rickshaw drivers or casual laborers, and broken down by harsh conditions and brutal extremes of temperature. Harsh Mander, a social worker and activist who led a 2010 analysis of unidentified bodies in Delhi, found that the average age of men who died alone here — it is almost always men — was around 42.      Police records offer the vaguest of explanations. Most often, the cause of death is given as “natural,” but others are marked as “illness/weakness,” “due to hunger or thirst,” “due to extreme cold or heat,” “accident,” “tuberculosis,” “suicide,” or, peculiarly, “beggar type.”      The police usually find the bodies around the railway tracks or on the side of the road. Often the bodies are entirely naked. If a police officer, for some reason, makes a sincere attempt to discover the identity of a body he has found, Mr. Yamin said, he will swiftly find himself overwhelmed in the days that follow, as the number of unknown bodies in his custody mounts.      Once, Mr. Yamin managed to discover the identity of a man whose corpse he had found and took it all the way to the man’s native village, where his uncles still lived. They gave him a two-line response: “He sold off his home and his belongings many years ago, as a young boy, and his parents are no more. You can do what you deem fit with his body.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      All this is a familiar story for the mortuary workers, and they do not find it especially tragic. Dr. Gupta recalled, with distaste, going to the Hanuman temple to distribute 50-rupee notes — about 80 cents — after his brother’s death, and being rushed by so many beggars that he needed to be rescued by the police. On the streets, he said, men become addicted to drugs and engage in gay sex, rendering them “useless to society.”      “They are of worse nature, and it is their karma,” he said. “They do not want to help themselves.”      One of his workers, Purushottam, vigorously agreed. He recalled that for a time he would buy bananas every day to distribute to the “vagabonds,” as he called them. But then he was rebuked by police officers, who told him the men were selling his bananas at the market and using the money to buy drugs. “So we stopped feeding them,” he said.      “We feed the birds instead,” said Parveen Sharma, another mortuary worker. “At least we know they will eat the food.” ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Question: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural? Answer:","output":"Since Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, he should choose the mountain range where valley glaciers are not present.

(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. \\"It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger. I'm so happy, it's crazy,\\" the 26-year-old told reporters after reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time. \\"He's the biggest champion in the sport.

Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions.

Český jazyk, který patří do slovanské jazykové skupiny, je mateřským jazykem obyvatel České republiky. Přestože angličtina a čeština se vzájemně hodně liší, oba jazyky mají určité gramatické a syntaktické pravidla, která umožňují překlad mezi nimi. Překlad věty z angličtiny do češtiny vyžaduje znalost obou jazyků a uvědomění si některých klíčových rozdílů: 1. Slovosled: Ve srovnání s angličtinou může být ve češtině, která je flektivní jazyk, slovosled více volný. To znamená, že podstatná jména, přídavná jména a zájmena se mohou ve větě pohybovat a stále zachovávat stejný význam. 2. Pády: Čeština má sedm pádů, které ovlivňují tvar slov. Při překladu do češtiny je důležité určit správný pád pro každé slovo. 3. Rod: V češtině má každé podstatné jméno určitý gramatický rod - mužský, ženský nebo střední. Rod ovlivňuje skloňování slov a musí být při překladu brán v úvahu. 4. Časování: Slovesa se v češtině časují podle osoby, čísla a času. Aby byl překlad správný, je důležité sloveso vhodně časovat. 5. Idiomatika a frazeologie: Při překladu je zásadní zohlednit kulturní a jazykové nuance, které mohou být specifické pro daný jazyk. Výrazy a idiomy se obvykle překládají, aby byl zachován jejich původní význam a kontext.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. \\"They have to pass it,\\" Kerry said. \\"... It's up to the people of Afghanistan.\\" If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last \\"until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated\\" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false. The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting \\"Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" and adds U.S. forces \\"shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes.\\" But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting \\"it's just not even on the table.\\" \\"I don't know where the idea of an apology started,\\" Kerry said. \\"President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever.\\" The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that \\"U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism.\\" \\"U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes,\\" the tentative deal states.

The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military \\"shall have the exclusive right\\" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have \\"a very limited mission\\" and would not be \\"patrolling cities or mountains.\\" \\"The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised,\\" Carney said. \\"The combat mission will be over.\\" Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan \\"very limited,\\" adding \\"it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist\\" Afghan forces.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio 57 and Weight Room in New York City, with mixing handled by Mike Shipley and Tony Maserati. Following release of the album, Pru spoke highly of her experiences with the producers and felt that they \\"la[id] a good bed around the lyrics and the melodies\\".

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you live in a place with mild winters - growing zone 10-12 or higher - you should be able to plant the poinsettia directly in the ground, where it will grow as a perennial and get larger with each passing year. If you're in a place where the temperature dips to freezing temperatures during the winter, you're better off keeping it in the pot as a houseplant. Poinsettia are native to Mexico, and they need a warm climate to thrive. If you bought the poinsettia during the winter as a decoration, keep the plant in the pot until spring, even if you live in a place with mild winters. If it came in foil remove the wrapper so water can drain from the pot. It needs to stay potted until the weather gets warm enough to transplant it. Water it whenever the soil starts to dry out.  At the beginning of spring, in March or April, cut the poinsettia back to about 8 inches. This will encourage it to begin a new growing cycle and get it ready for transplanting. Keep it watered and fertilize it once a month or so until early summer, when it's time for transplanting. Look for a place where the poinsettia will get morning sun as well as light or partial shade during the heat of the afternoon. Till the soil and loosen it to a depth of 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm). Enrich the soil by adding organic compost if necessary. Poinsettias prefer rich, well-drained soil. Dig a hole as wide as the poinsettia's root ball and plant the poinsettia. Pat soil gently around the base of the stem. Mulch the area around the base of the plant with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of organic mulch. This keeps the soil cool and helps it retain moisture. You can apply a 12-12-12 or 20-20-20 compound at the start of the growing season or fertilize the plant with compost. If your soil is not very rich, you may need to fertilize the plants once a month. Water the plant at the base whenever the soil around the plant feels dry to the touch. Avoid overhead watering, which could cause fungal disease to form on the leaves of the plant. Pinch small growing shoots from poinsettias occasionally throughout the growing season to encourage the plants to flower. You can discard the shoots or use them to propagate new plants. Cut back old growth in late fall or early winter to encourage strong new growth the following spring. You can take 8 inch (20 cm) cuttings from the soft growing tips of poinsettia stems or 18 inch (45 cm) cuttings from the woody stems of the plant to create new poinsettia.  Dip the ends of each cutting into a rooting hormone, then insert it into a pot filled with potting soil or a vermiculite mix. Keep the soil in the pot moist, but not wet, for several weeks while the cuttings make roots. Add fresh mulch around the base of the plant to keep the soil warm for the winter months. Poinsettia can winter over in areas where soil temperatures do not fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius). Dig the plants up and bring them indoors if you live in a climate where winters are cold and soil temperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius). Summary:","output":"This article provides guidance on planting poinsettias in warm climates as perennials and maintaining them as houseplants in colder climates, emphasizing the importance of proper watering, sunlight, soil enrichment, and pruning to ensure healthy growth and flowering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you see a couple of cool kids by themselves, go up and small talk to learn some basic interests.  Ask if they’ve heard about the theme for homecoming. Tell them about your weekend. Bring up a class you have in common. Lunch is a very important time for socializing in school. It’s one of the few times of the day you actually have time to chat about absolutely anything for more than a moment or two. Don’t overthink it—simply walk up and ask if you can sit with them. They’ll probably control the conversation but tune in when you can.If nothing else—you can talk about the food. Cafeteria food is always an open ended conversation. Put together a hangout to get everyone together. It can be a study party for a big test, an evening hangout, or a spot to prepare for the game or dance that weekend. Make sure you ask your parents before you invite a lot of people to your house. The cool kids, as most people you’ll encounter in your life, will find it easier to relate to you if you have a sense of humor. When they start asking you questions, answer with some humor.

Over half the county is protected countryside, offering walking, cycling and other recreational opportunities.  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - The Weald is an area in South East England situated between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \\"High Weald\\" in the centre; the clay \\"Low Weald\\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \\"woodland.\\" The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Abstract: The purpose of the present experiment was to study frequency changes in gastric myoelectric activity of healthy human subjects and the development of symptoms of motion sickness as brought about by vection or illusory self-motion. Fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum, the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals (i.e., mismatched sensory input). An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness. Running spectral analysis revealed a close correspondence over time between tachygastria and reports of symptoms of motion sickness.","output":"Task: Generate a title for the given abstract that conveys the key focus of the paper.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Water is the only substance on Earth that is stable in all three states.   Q: What is the only substance on earth that is stable in all three states?   Choices:  - carbon  - mercury  - air  - water  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"Water. Based on the given paragraph, it states that water is the only substance on Earth that is stable in all three states. Let's elaborate further on this topic to understand why water is indeed the correct choice among the other options provided: The three fundamental states of matter are: solid, liquid, and gas. Water, as a substance, can exist in all three states under the normal range of temperatures and pressures on Earth. 1. Solid State: In the solid state, water forms ice. This occurs at temperatures below its freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. Ice is a common occurrence in colder regions and during the winter months. 2. Liquid State: In the liquid state, we are most familiar with water as it serves as the basis of life on Earth, and it covers 71% of the Earth's surface in the form of rivers, lakes, and oceans. Water is a liquid at temperatures between its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius) and boiling point (100 degrees Celsius, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. 3. Gas State: Water in its gaseous state is known as water vapor or steam. It occurs when water reaches its boiling point or when it evaporates from an open surface at lower temperatures. Water vapor is an essential component of Earth's atmosphere and the water cycle, as it facilitates the transport of water from one location to another in the form of clouds and precipitation. Now let's briefly examine the other options provided in the question: - Carbon: Carbon is an element that can exist in various forms, such as graphite, diamond, and fullerenes. While it can exist in different forms, it does not generally exist in the three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) under normal Earth conditions. Carbon can sublimate directly to gas without passing through a liquid state in certain conditions, but it does not exhibit a stable liquid state.    - Mercury: Mercury is a unique metal that is liquid at room temperature, and it is used in applications such as thermometers and barometers. However, at standard atmospheric conditions, mercury cannot be found in a stable solid state, as it solidifies at -38.83 degrees Celsius (-37.89 degrees Fahrenheit). It can also become a gas when it reaches its boiling point of 356.73 degrees Celsius (674.11 degrees Fahrenheit), but it does not exist stably in all three states. - Air: Air is a mixture of gases and cannot be considered a single substance. Even when considering individual components of air, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, they do not transition into stable solid and liquid states at standard conditions on Earth. In summary, water is the only substance among the given choices that is stable in all three states (solid, liquid, and gas) under the normal range of temperatures and pressures on Earth. This unique property of water plays a significant role in various natural processes and contributes to the sustenance of life on our planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  Answer this question please: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","output":"Based on the provided information, the Deep lake with geothermal activity would have warmer water at the bottom. This is due to the exposure to geothermal heat sources which warm the deeper water, while surface water remains cooler. Convection currents may be generated as a result of this difference in temperature.

Report a Typo ||||| New York City and Long Island will institute gas rationing starting tomorrow, officials announced, to help ease long gas-station lines, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.      The new rules will allow cars to fuel up, only if the last number of the license plate matches the day’s date.      For example, tomorrow will be Nov. 9, so only cars with an ending odd number can buy gas. Saturday will be Nov. 10, when even numbers will be allowed to fuel up, and so on.      License plates with no numbers — as in cheesy vanity plates — will be considered odd-number for this program.      The new, temporary rules goes into effect at 5 a.m. on Long Island and 6 a.m. in the city.      “This is designed to let everybody have a fair a chance [to buy gas so] lines [are not] too oppressive,” Mayor Bloomberg said      “But we have to do something and this is something that is practical and enforceable and understandable.”      He added: “Doing something is a lot better than doing nothing.”      The mayor said he took the idea from New Jersey, where gas lines went from two hours to 45 minutes once the odd-even system was put in place.      “We’ll keep it in for a while, [at least until] sometime next week,” Bloomberg said. “If you think about it, it’s not any great imposition once you get used to it so there’s no reason to take it out right away.”      NYPD cops will be at all city gas stations to enforce the rule.      Bloomberg warned New Yorkers that cops can tell if you switch license plates      “The police can easily look at your registration,” he said, “so don’t try to be cute.”      The gas rationing plan is the latest blow, suffered by New Yorkers, struggling to overcome Hurricane Sandy last week and a powerful nor’easter that blew through town yesterday afternoon and overnight.      This latest sucker punch from Mother Nature complicated efforts to repair Hurricane Sandy-damaged neighborhoods throughout New York and New Jersey.      By this morning, there were 108,000 Nassau County customers without power, Gov. Cuomo said. There were also still huge numbers of darkened homes and business in Suffolk County [79,000], Westchester County [35,000] and Queens [23,000].      By this morning, there were 108,000 Nassau County customers without power, Gov. Cuomo said. There were also still huge numbers of darkened homes and business in Suffolk County [79,000], Westchester County [35,000] and Queens [23,000].      “Last night was half a step back in Nassau and Suffolk with an increase in number of people who lost power,” Cuomo said.      “Progress is slow because in impacted areas, you have to go building by building because you have to find out what buildings can take the power. That’s a labor-intensive activity.”      The governor reiterated his beef with power companies, who have been slow to restore light to all.      “I believe the system is archaic and is obsolete in many ways. No, I don’t believe what they did was adequate,” he said.      “Part was system design, part was performance, part because they are a monopoly. At least with government, you can fire the person in charge. You’re unhappy with the utility company – who can you fire? They’re this nameless, faceless bureaucracy that is a monopoly that operates with very little incentive or sanction.”      A Con Ed rep said customers who lost power to Hurricane Sandy would get priority over those who lost service from this latest storm.      “I think we’re going to be able to power through. Our objective was to get power restored to everyone by the weekend and we’re still working with that goal,” said Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for the utility.      Meanwhile in New Jersey, more than 390,000 customers had no power as of this morning, officials said.      Gov. Chris Christie said he believes virtually every Garden State resident — outside hardest hit zones near Point Pleasant and Seaside Heights — should have lights on by this weekend.      “I think most people l will have power by Saturday. This [nor’easter] set us back a day, 24 hours, 36 hours,” Christie said, after visiting with National Guard in Somerset. “This pushes back to late Saturday, early Sunday at the latest.”      Getting from Point A to Point B around the tri-state area remained a challenged today — though delivered a bit of good news to commuters, announcing that the Queens-Midtown Tunnel would be open and going both ways by 6 a.m. tomorrow.      Life at New York’s three nearby airports slowly got back to normal today, as workers cleared snow and planes went wheels up this morning.      A majority of flights — especially to short-haul destinations — were able to take off. But many cross-country and international flights were cancelled this morning.      That added to an already huge list of travelers trapped in town by this nor’easter that slammed Gotham and forced cancellation of thousands of flights from JFK, LaGuardia and Newark.      Storm-battered New Yorkers were just grateful late night’s weather didn’t lead to any more floods.      “The good news, thank goodness, is except for maybe two inches of snow, there were no other problems,” said Randi Savron, 51, a schoolteacher who lives in the Rockaways, one of the areas that flooded badly last week.      Storm survivors from the Rockaways to Red Hook and Staten Island endured frigid temperatures in blacked-out homes last night with no heat — choosing not to evacuate and risk break-ins and looting.      Temperatures hovered around the freezing mark through the night, with wind chills in the teens.      “The wind, the snow and the cold is just rubbing salt in the wounds that were already open as a result of Sandy,” said AccuWeather meteorologist Erik Pindrock.      The storm dumped more than half a foot of snow in some areas and causing another round of power outages.      The National Weather Service reported this morning that the highest snowfall total from yesterday’s storm is in Armonk in Westchester County, where nearly 8 inches of snow has fallen.      Parts of the city have received 4 to 7 inches of snow, with the highest totals in Queens and Staten Island.      Snowfall totals in Suffolk, Nassau and Putnam counties range from 4 to nearly 7 inches.      About a dozen schools in Westchester are opening two hours late because of the storm.      The city warned residents of the most at-risk areas to leave, but many people were already gone or refused to come to the door, Mayor Bloomberg said.      Staten Islanders were fed up with Mother Nature’s wrath.      “It stinks. It’s a torture chamber,” said Freddy Ariemma, 45. “It took us a whole week to get ready for the last storm. Now I have to get rid of all this snow.”      Sandy’s city death toll rose to 41 yesterday after William McKeon, 78, died Tuesday night from storm-related injuries. He was found unconscious at the bottom of a set of wet and sandy stairs in the Rockaways.      Residents in Red Hook housing projects stocked up on blankets and coats to prepare for the new storm.      “I’m just trying to get blankets to stay warm,” said Ileen Carrillo, 35, who was in her 10th day without electricity or heat. “We keep the pilot stove on, which is dangerous, and we moved the couches together for body heat.”      Rockaway residents without heat or power stood out in the cold yesterday waiting for volunteers to dole out flashlights, batteries, diapers and baby formula.      “We are going to have to stay here. We have no choice,” said Gloria Almond, 51, who lives in a bungalow on Beach 26th Street.      “We just got over Sandy, and now another one is hitting us. It’s sad. We’re cold. We all got flooded out.”      The storm brought down electrical wires in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, causing them to spark and leaving residents nearby without power      Driving sleet and high winds of up to 50 mph yesterday compounded Long Island’s misery.      “This is becoming unbearable,” said Kristi McAllister of Island Park, shielding her eyes from driving sleet as her flood-destroyed belongings sat in a snow-coated pile in front of her home.      “This is the last thing we needed. I don’t even want to think about how much longer we have to go through this.”      Additional reporting by David Seifman, Selim Algar, Joe Tacopino, Dana Sauchelli, Lorena Mongelli, Dan MacLeod ||||| Nor'easter Wraps Up in Philadelphia, New York City      By Courtney Spamer, Meteorologist November 09, 2012; 3:40 AM Share |      While the nor'easter is not completely finished and is still causing trouble in the Northeast, it has finally wrapped up across the mid-Atlantic.      The southern portion of the Northeast had most of their rain, snow and wind from this storm by 5 a.m.      Wednesday alone, Newark, N.J. received 5.7 inches of snow. This broke the old daily record snowfall of only a trace set back in 1981.      Most of New York City's precipitation also fell as snow, picking up 4.3 inches Wednesday with a storm total of 4.7 inches. The Wednesday total broke yet another daily record, previously 0.10 of an inch from the year 1878.      New York City and Newark were not the only cities across the Northeast that set daily snowfall records.      Many impacts were felt along all of the mid-Atlantic states with this storm.      Pennsylvania:      The highest Pennsylvania wind gust was 31 mph at the Northeast Philadelphia Airport. Thankfully, this was a far cry from the intense winds that affected the area during Hurricane Sandy.      The amount of snow that fell in The Keystone State was also relatively tame. The highest recorded snow amount was in Lower Makefield Township which came in at 2 inches.      New Jersey:      New Jersey, however, was a completely different story. Some of the highest snow totals have been recorded in central New Jersey. Freehold, for one, recorded 13 inches of snow through early Thursday morning. Manchester Township, just one county farther south, recorded 12 inches of snow.      Even the more coastal areas of New Jersey had some snow yesterday. Atlantic City, one of the many towns devastated by Sandy early last week, received 2.5 inches of snow on top of more than a quarter of an inch of rain. This broke the previous daily snow record of 2.0 inches from 1953.      New York:      Snow showers are expected to continue this morning over Long Island as wrap-around moisture pushes through.      New York state is also about done seeing snow from this storm. Warwick recorded 4.7 inches of snow, and Kent Cliffs in Putnam County had 6.5 inches of snow.      Flushing, in Queens County, accumulated 7 inches of snow as of 8 a.m. EST Thursday and Malverne tallied up 6.5 inches. ||||| Loading Photo Gallery      When the day started in New Jersey, temperatures were hovering as high as the mid 40s and snow seemed out of the question — until a little atmospheric physics came into play.      As expected, a nor’easter skirted the New Jersey coast today, buffering the shore with high winds and surf at a time when it needed it least, following the devastation left by Hurricane Sandy. As recently as Tuesday afternoon, forecasters were largely downplaying the threat of snow. But by this afternoon, snow was quickly becoming the story of the storm.      \\"All last winter, it was darn hard to get it to snow in New Jersey. Here we are back in early November and it snowed from the get go with this storm,\\" said David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University. \\"That’s three straight years now we’ve seen snow in the fall, October (2010), October (2011) and now again this November. That’s pretty unusual.\\"      As day progressed, temperatures crashed statewide, and heavy snow was reported from Newark to Atlantic City. By 3 p.m., the warmest part of the state was what is typically the coldest, as temperatures remained near 40 in Warren and Sussex counties while the mercury in much of the Garden State plunged toward freezing.      According to experts, the reason for this was two-fold.      First, ahead of the storm New Jersey was extremely dry. As precipitation began to fall, it evaporated, soaking up heat as liquid turned to gas in the lower levels of the atmosphere.            \\"The key there is it takes energy to evaporate moisture,\\" Robinson said. \\"That will lower the temperature as it occurs.\\"      This started the cooling process, Robinson said. After that, the nor’easter’s strength itself took over, said Joe Miketta, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly.      \\"When you start to get heavier precipitation falling, it (was) actually dragging some of that cold air down from the atmosphere,\\" Miketta said. \\"Where that happens, that’s where you start to see the heaviest snow.\\"      By this evening, several inches had fallen in parts of Atlantic County and was piling up elsewhere, causing growing concern for additional power outages in a state where hundreds of thousands remain in the dark following Sandy. Up to six inches was expected to fall in some areas before the storm pulls away.      While the nor’easter is the latest headache for the storm-weary state, New Jersey finally appears poised to break out of the weather pattern that led to Sandy’s devastation and and earlier than usual first snowfall, forecasters say. Temperatures could reach the 60s this weekend and quieter weather is forecast to overtake the region for the coming week.      \\"We’re just finding different ways to amaze,\\" said Robinson, referring to New Jersey’s recent run of wild weather. \\"But it appears we will thankfully see a mid-month break.\\"            Related coverage:      • Nor'easter live blog: Latest updates for the post-Sandy storm      • Barrier island officials fear nor'easter could complicate recovery efforts      • More than 363K N.J. customers still without power as crews handle nor'easter      • Rough riders: Nor'easter has commuters bracing for another tedious trek       ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This news article is about a big storm called a nor'easter that brought lots of snow, rain, and strong winds to a place called New England.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis step-by-step. 1. Identify the core message of the premise: The premise states that a particular statement might not be a prophecy but rather a reflection of the town's tumultuous history. 2. Identify the core message of the hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the statement in question might not be a prediction for the future, but rather a reflection on the town's troubled past. 3. Compare the core messages: Both the premise and hypothesis have the same core idea - that the statement in question is more likely to be a reflection of the town's past rather than a prediction of the future. The only difference in wording is the use of \\"tumultuous\\" in the premise and \\"troubled\\" in the hypothesis. 4. Draw the conclusion: Based on the comparison, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true (the statement is a reflection of the town's tumultuous history), then it supports the hypothesis (the statement is not so much a prediction for the future but a reflection on the town's troubled past). The two statements are very similar in meaning and the difference in wording does not significantly affect their congruence.

Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish.    Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams.    Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

It took a long time for Mary to heal from her fallout with Tanya as","output":"the depth of their friendship had made the betrayal even more painful. Mary could still remember the day when Tanya revealed her true colors, leaving her in utter shock. The first step in moving forward was for Mary to fully grasp the situation and come to terms with the fact that Tanya was not the person she thought she knew. Step 1: Acceptance In order to heal, Mary had to accept that Tanya was a completely different person from the loyal friend she had trusted for so long. It was challenging as she went over the countless memories they had shared, wondering if Tanya had been pretending the entire time. The process of acceptance was slow and difficult, but it was essential in order for Mary to let go and find closure. Step 2: Emotional Expression Mary found it crucial to express and release the hurt, anger, and sadness that she felt as a result of Tanya's actions. She chose to write in a journal, where she could vent her feelings honestly and privately, without the fear of judgment from others. This outlet allowed her to process her emotions and gain a clearer understanding of her thoughts and experiences. Step 3: Seeking Support As Mary worked through her feelings, she reached out to her friends and family for support. They provided her with the much-needed love, encouragement, and a sense of belonging as she faced her challenging emotional journey. Their presence acted as a reminder that despite the loss of one friendship, she still had others who cared for her deeply. Step 4: Forgiveness Although it took a considerable amount of time, Mary eventually reached a point where she was able to forgive Tanya. Forgiveness didn't mean that she condoned Tanya's actions, but rather, she let go of the resentment and negative emotions she had been holding onto. Forgiving Tanya allowed Mary to free herself from the hold that the betrayal had on her life, and in turn, regain her emotional well-being. Step 5: Moving Forward With forgiveness achieved, Mary began to rebuild her life without Tanya. She focused on strengthening her relationships with her existing support network, and even forged new connections along the way. While the betrayal was painful, it ultimately pushed Mary towards personal growth and lessons that she would carry with her throughout her life. In the end, the long and intertwining road towards healing taught Mary several valuable lessons about trust, friendship, and resilience. As she closed the chapter on her fallout with Tanya, Mary emerged stronger and more self-aware, ready to embrace new experiences and authentic connections with those who truly deserved her trust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Possible answers: (I) yes; (II) no;","output":"(I) yes; Humbert of Romans, a prominent figure in the Dominican Order during the 13th century, was deeply passionate about languages. He sought to advance linguistic studies, particularly in the field of Arabic, as a means to support the Dominican Order's missionary efforts. These efforts were focused on engaging with the Muslim population in the Middle East who had either strayed from Christianity or had been forced to convert to Islam. Humbert's dedication to linguistic learning served to bridge cultural gaps and facilitate communication, understanding, and religious outreach. By embracing and promoting the study of Arabic and other languages, Humbert was able to help Dominican missionaries in their quest to spread Christian teachings and bring the lost souls back to the faith. Aside from Arabic, Humbert also encouraged the study of other languages that were relevant to the mission fields at the time, such as Hebrew and Greek. This broad interest in diverse languages highlights the depth of Humbert's love for languages and his commitment to using them as essential tools in the service of the Church and its evangelizing missions. In summary, the subject Humbert loved very much was languages, with particular emphasis on Arabic, due to its relevance to the missionary work the Dominicans were undertaking in the Middle East.

Natalie was very good at sports but Rachel was not.  Choose your answer from: a. Natalie made it onto the football team.. b. Rachel made it onto the football team..","output":"To determine the most appropriate ending for the sentence, we should analyze the context and information provided. The sentence states that \\"Natalie was very good at sports but Rachel was not.\\" Based on this information, we can infer the following: 1. Natalie has a high level of skill in sports. 2. Rachel, in contrast, does not have the same level of skill in sports. Now, let's examine the two options: a. Natalie made it onto the football team. b. Rachel made it onto the football team. Option (a) aligns with the information provided in the sentence because it states that Natalie, who is good at sports, made it onto the football team. This ending is consistent with the presented context. Option (b) contradicts the information in the sentence. Since Rachel is not good at sports, it would be less likely that she makes it onto the football team.

Context: To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.","output":"In India during the Cretaceous, there were massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications.

The city of Oklahoma City has designated Santa Fe railway station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the greater area .","output":"These two sentences from Wikipedia share a similar meaning, but they are not identical due to differences in wording and focus. Both sentences highlight the designation of a location for intermodal transit in a city and its surrounding area. However, the first sentence emphasizes the involvement of Santa Fe, while the second emphasizes Oklahoma City. The first sentence states that Santa Fe has designated the Oklahoma City station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the conurbation area. In this sentence, \\"the city of Santa Fe\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"the Oklahoma City station\\" is the designated location for intermodal transit. Furthermore, the surrounding area referred to in this sentence is described as \\"the conurbation area\\" which implies a densely populated urban area. The second sentence, on the other hand, states that Oklahoma City has designated the Santa Fe railway station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the greater area. Here, \\"the city of Oklahoma City\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"Santa Fe railway station\\" is the designated location. Additionally, the surrounding area is referred to as \\"the greater area,\\" which is a more general term that encompasses the broader region around the city. To summarize, while both sentences convey the designation of a location for intermodal transit in a city and its surrounding area, they differ in terms of the city making the decision and the specific phrasing used to describe the surrounding area. The first sentence primarily focuses on Santa Fe and the decision regarding Oklahoma City station in the context of the conurbation area, while the second sentence focuses on Oklahoma City and the decision regarding the Santa Fe railway station within the greater area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eta Carinae is the most prominent variable star in Carina; with a mass of approximately 100 solar masses and 4 million times as bright as the Sun. It was first discovered to be unusual in 1677, when its magnitude suddenly rose to 4, attracting the attention of Edmond Halley. Eta Carinae is inside NGC 3372, commonly called the Carina Nebula. It had a long outburst in 1827, when it brightened to magnitude 1, only fading to magnitude 1.5 in 1828. Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of Sirius; it brightened to magnitude −1.5 in 1843. However, since 1843, Eta Carinae has remained relatively placid, having a magnitude between 6.5 and 7.9. However, in 1998, it brightened again, though only to magnitude 5.0, a far less drastic outburst. Eta Carinae is a binary star, with a companion that has a period of 5.5 years; the two stars are surrounded by the Homunculus Nebula, which is composed of gas that was ejected in 1843.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British tabloid names Diana 'killer' In a front-page splash on the day Britain opened an inquest into Diana's death,Â The MirrorÂ named the person she had claimed was \\"planning an accident\\" in a chilling prediction of her own death in a car crash in August 1997. She made the allegation in a letter she gave to her butler and confidant, Paul Burrell, before she died. The former wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died at the age of 36, along with her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul in a Paris road tunnel. The Mirror appeared to be risking an aggressive legal response from Buckingham Palace to its story on Tuesday. The rest of the normally competitive British media omitted the name, apparently to avoid legal action under Britain's tough defamation laws.Â TheÂ tabloid printed a copy of the letter Diana wrote just 10 months before her death on its inside pages. Although it identified the person in its own story, the name was blanked out in the reproduction of the handwritten letter. \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\\" it quoted the letter as saying. \\"(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\\" \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Sensational headlines \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Burrell, who gave The Mirror access to the letter as part of a serialisation of excerpts of his book which was published late last year, reacted angrily to news the name had been revealed. \\"I am not very happy about it... I only learnt about it late last night. And it was always my intention never to publish that name,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. Britain's tabloid newspapers have been engaged in an almost daily battle in the years since Diana's death to produce the most sensational headlines about Diana, Charles and other members of her family and former household. Tuesday's revelation came as Royal Coroner Michael Burgess was due to open and adjourn inquests into the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Hundreds of journalists from around the world gathered for the start of the inquests in central London - the first official public hearings into the crash to be held on British soil. An inquiry by French authorities in 1999 ruled the accident was caused by Diana'sÂ chauffeur being drunk and driving too fast. The Mirror said Burrell was prepared to hand over the Diana letter to the coroner as part of the inquest. It said that in doing so, he would be \\"honouring a long-standing promise to cooperate fully with the inquiries\\". After a 15-year marriage, Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after both had admitted to having adulterous affairs.","output":"The British tabloid The Mirror published a person's name who Princess Diana claimed was planning a car accident for her in a letter given to her former butler, Paul Burrell, prior to her death in 1997.

Vuk Draskovic, the Foreign Minister, has expressed concerns about the ongoing presence of what he refers to as \\"death squads\\" connected to the former Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. These death squads were allegedly used by Milosevic during his time in power to carry out various brutal acts, including acts of violence and mass killings, as part of a larger campaign of state-sanctioned terror and repression against opposition groups and certain ethnic communities. The reference to the \\"death squads\\" reveals a significant concern on Draskovic's part that the current state of affairs in the region may not have changed much since Milosevic's time in power. The fact that these groups still exist suggests that there continues to be a great deal of unrest, political instability, and potential for violence in the region. In making this statement, Draskovic may be attempting to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation, and to the importance of pursuing reform and measures aimed at breaking down the remnants of Milosevic's brutal regime. This could include efforts to apprehend and bring to justice individuals who were involved in the \\"death squads\\" and their activities, as well as broader actions aimed at promoting political stability, reconciliation, and peace in the region. Additionally, the Foreign Minister's statement highlights the need for increased international attention and support in order to address these ongoing security challenges. This could involve providing assistance in the areas of counter-terrorism and organized crime prevention, as well as offering support for legal and institutional reforms in order to ensure that those responsible for past crimes are held accountable. In summary, the statement by Foreign Minister Draskovic serves as a stark reminder of the brutal legacy left by Slobodan Milosevic and his regime.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Cover-up claims: Former MP and Lib Dem presidency candidate Liz Lynne at the party's conference in Glasgow last week A leading candidate for the Lib Dem presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up Cyril Smith’s vile catalogue of child sex abuse. Liz Lynne, who succeeded Smith as MP for Rochdale, allegedly ordered her PA to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile. They detailed a litany of abuse at the Knowl View children’s home in Rochdale, which closed in the mid-1990s. The PA, Deborah Doyle, said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home, Martin Digan. Last night Miss Lynne said: ‘I have no recollection whatsoever of anybody contacting me about allegations against Cyril Smith or child abuse at","output":"Knowl View children's home. If any such allegations were brought to my attention, I would have taken the appropriate steps to ensure they were thoroughly investigated. It is crucial to protect the welfare of all children, and any claims of abuse need to be treated with the utmost seriousness.' One possible course of action would be to launch an independent investigation into the cover-up claims. The investigation should be led by an impartial third party with no connections to the individuals involved. This would involve gathering all relevant evidence, including statements from Deborah Doyle, Martin Digan, and any other potential witnesses. Additionally, any documents, recordings, or other materials related to the allegations should be collected and preserved. Step 1: Appoint an impartial investigator. To ensure a fair examination of the claims, an unbiased investigator with experience in handling similar cases should be assigned. This individual should possess legal expertise, investigative experience, and familiarity with child abuse cases and their potential impact on the victims. Step 2: Gather evidence. The investigator should collect all pertinent evidence, including the allegedly destroyed notes, any existing records, and statements from those involved or potentially aware of the situation. This should involve interviews with the former PA, the former manager of the home, and any other relevant individuals who may have information about the allegations or the handling of the case. Step 3: Analyze the evidence. The collected evidence should be carefully reviewed, and the credibility of the witnesses should be assessed. The investigator should consider any potential biases, inconsistencies, and other factors that may impact the integrity of the evidence. Step 4: Present the findings. Based on the gathered evidence and analysis, the investigator should present the findings to all relevant parties, taking into account the potential implications for the individuals involved and the need to ensure justice and accountability. This may include reporting the findings to the Lib Dem party, law enforcement authorities, and any organizations responsible for the care and protection of children. Step 5: Take appropriate action. If the investigation concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support the cover-up claims, the responsible individuals should be held accountable, and appropriate measures should be taken to address the situation. This may involve sanctions or disciplinary action against the accused party, as well as steps to prevent future instances of abuse and cover-ups. If the evidence is inconclusive or does not support the claims, further monitoring or inquiries may still be warranted in order to protect the welfare of all children involved. By following these steps, the most logical and thorough response to the allegations can be achieved, ensuring that any potential cover-up is uncovered and that those involved are held accountable for their actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Looking for signs of post-injection inflammatory reactions can help you figure out the best way to relieve your pain or if you need to see your doctor. Common symptoms are:  Itching Redness radiating from the injection site Warmth Swelling Tenderness Pain Put an ice or cold pack over the injection site. This can relieve itching, swelling, and pain by constricting blood flow and cooling your skin.  Leave the ice on the site for 15 – 20 minutes. Do this three to four times per day until the pain eases.  Use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have an ice pack. Put something like a towel between your skin and the ice or cold pack to minimize the risk of frostbite.  Put a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the injection site if you don’t want to use ice.  Avoid applying heat to your injection site. This can increase swelling as it brings more blood to infected area. Over-the-counter medications can relieve pain and swelling. Consider taking these medications if you have a lot of pain or inflammation at the injection site.  Take pain relievers including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers under 18, as it increases the risk for Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.  Minimize swelling with NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Avoid taxing the area where you had an injection, especially if it was a cortisone shot. This can give the injection site time to heal and may prevent further pain or discomfort.  Keep heavy lifting to a minimum if you got a shot in the arm. Stay off of your feet if you got an injection on your leg.  If you have received a steroid shot, avoid heat for 24 hours to ensure the injection will have maximum response.

Question: Process:  - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more children die young happens, how will it affect more adults have children.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more children die at a young age, it will have an impact on the \\"more adults have children\\" step in the process. The perturbation would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on that step in the process. Direct effect: If more children die young, the number of people who are able to grow into adulthood and become parents will be reduced. As a result, there will be fewer adults to have children, which directly impacts the number of new babies being born. This decrease in population growth could lead to a decline in the overall population if the number of children dying is significant. Indirect effects: 1. Societal impact: An increase in child mortality could induce psychological and social stressors on families and communities. This might lead to a societal shift where adults decide to have more children to counterbalance the premature loss of young lives. In this case, the perturbation could indirectly cause an increase in births. 2. Healthcare improvements: If the increased rate of child mortality is due to insufficient healthcare services or preventable diseases, societies might invest more in healthcare and preventative measures. This could lead to better health outcomes and survival rates for children, eventually resulting in a higher population of adults having children. 3. Economic impact: Higher child mortality could influence economic policies, allocation of resources, and even education systems as each nation tries to address the underlying causes of the increased mortality. These changes could subsequently influence family planning decisions, either positively or negatively, depending on the specific circumstances. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes an increase in child mortality will have direct and indirect effects on the \\"more adults have children\\" phase of the human lifecycle process. While the direct effect is straightforward, the indirect effects depend on various factors such as societal norms, healthcare systems, and economic influences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.  Now, I have a new situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect.  Answer this question please: Which species would have higher chance of passing their genes on to the next genertion, rhino or impala? A:","output":"Based on the given background and the new situation, it seems that the impalas have acquired behaviors that help them and their young survive in response to human encroachment, indicating an increase in their fitness. On the other hand, rhinos have also developed behaviors in response to the same threat, but these behaviors mostly failed to help them.  Considering that animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation through the process of evolution by natural selection, in this particular case, the impalas would have a higher chance of passing their genes on to the next generation compared to the rhinos. This is because the impalas have more successful adaptive behaviors that contribute to their survival and increase their fitness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, was killed by police in the deadly attack Thursday night during a protest against police killings of African American men. Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country.

Then Mrs. Harris said to her husband, \\"We've been to a lot of other people's houses, and now we must invite them to our house, mustn't we?\\" \\"Yes, certainly,\\" answered her husband, \\"A big party will be the easiest thing, won't it? Then we can start to invite people to dinner in small numbers next month.\\" So Mrs. Harris said, \\"Yes, I'll invite all our friends here to a big party on 5th December.\\" \\"How many will that be?\\" Mr. Harris asked. \\"Don't invite too many.\\" Mrs. Harris was beginning to write the invitations when her husband saw that she was writing, \\"Party. 6.30 to 8.30 p.m.\\" \\"That isn't very nice, is it?\\" he said. \\"You're telling our guests that they must go at 8.30.\\" So Mrs. Harris just wrote \\"Party. 6.30 p.m.\\" A lot of guests came, and they all had a good time, so they did not go home at 8.30.

Problem:(CNN) -- A Nebraska \\"hate crime\\" that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police. Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire. But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that \\"the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events\\" and that \\"extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.\\" Previously on CNN.com: Woman speaks out after alleged hate crime . Rogers was arrested Tuesday, police said. Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond. \\"She did not have to post any money\\" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police. \\"She maintains her innocence. This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged,\\" McArthur said. In a news release, police cited DNA and pathologists' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers' original statements, and changes in her story during the investigation. \\"These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens,\\" the police statement said. \\"A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case.\\" Beth Rigatuso, president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha, organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack. For her, the news that it may have been a hoax is \\"a pretty big blow.\\" \\"I don't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how, if this is really true...there is a lot of things going on with her,\\" Rigatuso said. \\"It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this.\\" Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now. The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than 1,800, all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers. \\"We'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence.\\" Rigatuso said Tuesday. McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he \\"knows nothing\\" about the fund or how much money might be in it. He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer. According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information \\"she knew to be false\\" with the intent to \\"instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter.\\" Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved \\"derogatory words\\" into her arms and abdomen and \\"a cross\\" in her chest. She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made. But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint, Rogers bedspread was \\"evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle.\\" A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread. Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers. \\"Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves,\\" Russell said. Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted. \\"This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body,...are accessible to the victim and follow the victim's frame of reference for reading and writing,\\" the deposition said. Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects. The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview. \\"For people to think this doesn't happen here, it does,\\" Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27. \\"It did.\\" She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview. Rogers' attorney at the time, Megan Mikolajczyk, told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week, but canceled saying \\"things have changed.\\" Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney. According to neighbor Linda Rappl, Rogers' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month. \\"I was in shock,\\" Rappl said soon after the incident. \\"She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.\\" Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911. Solution:","output":"A Nebraska \\"hate crime\\" targeted at an openly gay woman has been deemed staged by the alleged victim, Charlie Rogers. The inconsistencies in her version of events led the Lincoln Police Department to charge her with lying to police. Rogers, a former University of Nebraska basketball player, claimed three men had entered her home, assaulted her, and attempted to burn her house down.

The show was created by Gy Waldron and Jerry Rushing, and it was inspired by Rushing's experiences as a \\"moonshine runner\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. The main characters of the show include Bo Duke (played by John Schneider), Luke Duke (played by Tom Wopat), Daisy Duke (played by Catherine Bach), their wise Uncle Jesse Duke (played by Denver Pyle), and their trusty car, the General Lee (a 1969 Dodge Charger). Many storylines revolve around the Dukes' attempts to outsmart the corrupt county commissioner, Boss Hogg (played by Sorrell Booke), and his bumbling sidekick, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (played by James Best). Although set in Georgia, the show was predominantly filmed in California, specifically in the Santa Clarita area and on the Warner Bros. studio backlot. Occasionally, the show's producers would use stock footage of the southeastern United States to give the appearance of being filmed on location. Some episodes were also filmed at the Disney Ranch in Newhall, California, where they created a replica of part of the Hazzard town square. The Southern setting of the show played an essential role in developing the show's themes. One of the most iconic aspects of The Dukes of Hazzard is the General Lee's paint job, which features the Confederate flag on its roof, a nod to the cultural heritage of the South. As a result, the show incorporates various elements of Southern culture, such as country music, car racing, and rural living, into its storylines. Despite the show's fictional setting, it managed to captivate audiences with its blend of action, humor, and family values. Ultimately, The Dukes of Hazzard became a cultural phenomenon, with its influence stretching beyond its original run and solidifying its place in television history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbours are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country, it is not the largest in the world. In 1964, its population was over 185,000,000.        When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii.        Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are \\"the only real Americans\\". Most Americans come from all over the world.

And after an odd experience in my junior year, I decided that I'd go out and study agriculture or management, but I enrolled in both for a whole year and tried to learn the required courses. I lasted a year, and then I came back to the main campus and finished up as an economics major specializing in labor economics.  W: Did you go right graduate school or join the army after you graduated from the university?  M: Well, I went to Harvard as a graduate student in philosophy in 1936, and stayed there until the war broke out. I was drafted after I took my PhD exams in the early part of 1941. So I went into the army before Pearl Harbor.  Question: When did Mr. Hudson join the army?   - At the time of Pearl Harbor.  - Before his PhD exams.  - In 1941.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.  Question: \\"What was the White House response to the initial reports of the crash?\\" Response: \\"Thinking it must have been pilot error\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Barrie Aburn, from Dunedin on the South Island, was surprised when the mixed bag of lollies his young daughters bought him as a birthday present contained the lewd confectionery. Mr Aburn's partner Jacqui Hawkins was the first to notice them when she picked one randomly out of the bag of Dragon Sweets, The New Zealand Herald reported. Barrie Aburn, from Dunedin on the South Island, was surprised when the mixed bag of confectionery his young daughters bought him as a birthday present contained penis-shaped gummy lollies. 'I don't find anything amusing about it at all. I find it disgusting,' she said. The bag also contained gummy babies with penises. The Dragon Sweets were imported from China six weeks ago by confectionery company Dutch Rusk. Dutch Rusk managing director Willem Van de Geest said 7200 bags of mixed gummy lollies were distributed around the South Island, but said he was unaware they contained the inappropriate sweets. They have since been recalled. The Dragon Sweets were imported from China six weeks ago by confectionery company Dutch Rusk. 'You have to look at it two or three times to think that doesn't look right,' Mr Van de Geest said. He apologised to Mr Aburn and said it was a one-off occurrence that wouldn't happen again. Mr Van de Geest added that the lollies would not be considered offensive in Asia, where the shape is a sign of health and fertility. 'They wouldn't even blink an eyelid. We see it as offensive. We don't mind a hand or a foot being part of a lolly but we object to a breast or a penis,' he said. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.
