To correctly answer the question, we need to discuss the composition and structure of the bacterial cell wall.  The bacterial cell wall is an essential structural component of bacterial cells, especially in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cells from the external environment, give shape to the cells, and prevent them from bursting due to osmotic pressure. In bacteria, the cell wall is predominately made of a polymer called peptidoglycan (also known as murein). Peptidoglycan forms a mesh-like structure providing strength and rigidity to the cell wall. In the context of bacterial classification, the cell wall is the basis for the Gram-staining procedure, which separates bacteria into two groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The primary distinction between these groups lies in the thickness and composition of the peptidoglycan layer and the presence of additional components like lipopolysaccharides and teichoic acids, which affect the permeability and stability of the cell wall. However, there is no specific alternative name for the bacterial cell wall. It is worth mentioning that archaeal cells contain pseudo-peptidoglycan (also known as pseudomurein) instead of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, which gives them unique characteristics and makes them distinct from bacterial cells. Mycoplasma, a type of bacteria, lacks a cell wall entirely, but it does possess a cell membrane containing sterols that provide some structural support. In summary, the statement provided does not directly answer the question regarding the alternative name for the bacterial cell wall. The bacterial cell wall is mainly composed of peptidoglycan (murein), and there is no specific alternative name for it. Instead, the statement describes various antibiotic classes and their mechanisms of action on bacterial cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to tie pieces of paper together.","output":"Tying pieces of paper together can be accomplished using a variety of methods. The choice of method may vary based on the desired strength of the binding, the type of paper, the intended use for the bound papers, and the required aesthetics. Below are some simple techniques to tie pieces of paper together: 1. Stapling: One of the most common ways to bind pieces of paper together is through the use of a stapler. To do this, align the edges of the papers together, place them under the stapler's mouth, and press down firmly. The staples will effectively hold the papers in place. 2. Paperclips: A less permanent solution is to use paperclips. Simply align the edges of the papers together and slide a paperclip over the stack to hold the sheets in place. Multiple paperclips can be used along the edge if needed to maintain a stronger grip. 3. Rubber bands: Another method of temporarily binding papers together is by using rubber bands. Align the edges of the papers together and wrap the rubber band around the entire stack. You can use multiple rubber bands if needed, either along the same side or across different sides. 4. Hole punching and using string or ribbon: If you have a hole punch and some string or ribbon, you can create a more decorative binding for your papers. Start by aligning the edges of the papers together and using the hole punch to create holes along one edge. Then, cut a piece of string or ribbon long enough to thread through the holes and tie securely. Thread the string or ribbon through the holes, either in a looped pattern or a simple in-and-out pattern. Finally, tie the ends together in a knot or a bow for added flair. 5. Japanese bookbinding: A more advanced technique to tie pieces of paper together is the traditional Japanese bookbinding method. To do this, you will need a needle, a thread, and an awl or hole punch. Here are the steps to follow:     a. Begin by folding the pieces of paper in half to create pages.     b. Stack the folded pages on top of one another, ensuring the folded edges are aligned.     c. Measure and mark evenly spaced points along the folded edge where you would like to create holes.     d. Use an awl or hole punch to create holes at the marked points.     e. Cut a piece of thread that is about three times the length of the folded edge. Thread your needle.     f. Start on the inside of the first hole and pass the needle through to the outside. Leave a tail long enough to tie a knot at the end.     g. Pass the needle through the next hole from the outside to the inside.     h. Continue this process along the entire edge of the book.     i. Once you reach the last hole, loop around the edge and go back through the same hole from the outside to the inside.     j. Now work your way back along the spine, weaving the needle through the existing stitches until you reach the starting hole.     k. At the starting hole, pass the needle through the loop created by the first stitch.     l. Tie a knot with the tail of the thread to secure the binding, then trim the excess thread. 6. Binding with adhesive: Another option is to use adhesive to bind the papers together. You can use glue or double-sided tape to attach the edges of the papers together. Make sure to press down firmly when applying the adhesive so the papers stay securely bound. Regardless of the method you choose to tie pieces of paper together, always handle the materials carefully and take your time to ensure a neat and secure binding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Regular folks will get to buy at market price the next day. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Facebook's long road to an initial public offering is coming to an end. Late Thursday, it will fill in one last piece of the puzzle: Its final IPO price. That's the price at which Facebook's underwriters (including lead banker Morgan Stanley) will sell shares to their clients, which typically include large institutional investors, mutual funds and hedge funds. Some shares were made available to individual investors, but getting them typically requires either a lot of money or a lot of trading experience. It also required moving fast. Many brokerages offering pieces of Facebook's IPO allotment \\"closed their books\\" on Tuesday, meaning they stopped taking orders. Facebook currently plans to price its shares in the 34 to 38 range, but that target isn't binding and could still rise. The offering is expected to be heavily subscribed -- investor response has been \\"nothing short of pandemonium,\\" one source familiar with the discussions told CNNMoney. Facebook first filed its IPO paperwork on February 1 and has updated its filings eight times since then with additional details and new financial disclosures. Barring any unexpected complications, the Securities and Exchange Commission will officially certify the offering \\"effective\\" on Thursday. After Facebook gets the regulatory green light, the company will work with its underwriters to set its final price. Shares will then be released to those who have agreed to buy them. When can I buy? Ordinary investors looking to get a piece of Facebook will have to wait until the next morning. Unlike Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), whose IPO used a \\"Dutch auction\\" to allow direct bidding by investors, Facebook's setup doesn't give regular folks access until shares begin trading publicly. Those \\"regular\\" investors will get access to Facebook shares the morning after the price is set, when the stock begins publicly trading on the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange. That's currently slated to happen Friday. While the market opens at 9:30 am, Facebook's shares won't start trading instantly. It typically takes time -- sometimes an hour or more -- for newly listed shares to begin actively trading on the day of their public debut. In response to heavy demand, Facebook said early Wednesday that it will sell about 25% more shares than it had originally planned, bringing its total IPO offering to 421 million shares. Those additional shares will come from selling shareholders, not Facebook itself. That means Facebook could raise as much as 16 billion in its IPO. That would make it the largest tech IPO in history -- and the third largest U.S. IPO ever, trailing only the 19.7 billion raised by Visa (V, Fortune 500) in March 2008 and the 18.1 billion raised by automaker General Motors (GM, Fortune 500) in November 2010, according to rankings by Thomson Reuters. Overall, Facebook would be the 11th largest global IPO in history. How much Facebook is worth: If Facebook (FB) prices at the high end of its proposed per-share range, the company's market capitalization would hover around 81 billion on the day of its IPO. Many Facebook employees and executives hold unexercised stock options. If all of those shares were exercised, Facebook's outstanding share count would rise to around 2.8 billion -- pushing the company's total valuation closer to 106 billion. Who's selling shares: Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg plans to sell 30.2 million shares in the IPO offering. If Facebook prices at the top of its range, that will net Zuckerberg about 1 billion. But Zuckerberg won't be hanging on to his cash. Facebook said he will use the \\"substantial majority\\" of the windfall to cover the massive tax bill he'll be hit with, thanks to his plan to exercise a large stock-options grant that will increase his ownership stake in the company he founded. After the offering, Zuckerberg will hold 503.6 million shares, or about 31% of the company. That stake would be worth 19.1 billion if Facebook prices at the top of its current range. Venture capital firm Accel Partners, which is the largest shareholder outside of Zuckerberg, is selling 49 million shares in the offering. That's about a quarter of its Facebook holdings. -- CNNMoney's Chris Isidore and Maureen Farrell contributed reporting.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion.     Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force. Escaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\".

I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning.

Given the following context:  In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve.

Article:","output":"Title: Layering Tips for Staying Warm and Stylish this Winter Winter is the perfect time to show off your layering skills and stay warm while looking stylish. Layering not only keeps you cozy during the colder months but also allows you to adapt to changing temperatures throughout the day. Knowing how to layer your clothing can make the difference between a comfortable day out and wanting to hide indoors. Here are some tips on how to layer effectively while staying chic this winter. 1. Start with a base layer Begin by wearing a moisture-wicking base layer that is tight, but comfortable, to keep your body warm and dry during the day. Thermal or insulated fabrics like silk, merino wool, or synthetic materials are great choices for this layer. The base layer fits snugly against your skin to retain body heat and wick away moisture, ensuring your comfort throughout the day. 2. Add a removable shirt Your next layer should be a shirt that can be easily removed if needed. Opt for fabrics such as fleece, wool, or flannel, which will help you stay warm without adding too much bulk. These materials insulate your body and continue to wick away moisture, keeping you comfortable and dry. 3. Choose heavy pants It's time to store away your lightweight leggings and pants. Opt for heavy pants like jeans or corduroys for added warmth and insulation. These thicker materials protect your legs from harsh elements while maintaining a cool and stylish look. 4. Spice up your outfit with a casual or sophisticated touch Depending on your workplace or school dress code and your personal style, you can choose between various versatile options. For a relaxed and casual look, add a sweatshirt to your layered outfit. It provides extra warmth and insulation and gives off an effortlessly cool aura. If you're looking for a more professional or sophisticated appearance, opt for a classic cardigan. This lightweight layer adds a touch of elegance to your outfit, ideal for work or school settings. 5. Embrace your femininity with a warm dress Who says winter fashion can't be feminine? Pairing a dress with your base layer creates a warm yet charming look. Opt for thicker materials like wool or knit fabrics and try wearing opaque tights or leggings underneath for added insulation. In conclusion, layering your clothing helps keep you warm while offering a variety of stylish options for any winter day. Make the most of your wardrobe by focusing on versatile pieces and high-quality materials that can be easily adjusted for changing conditions. By mastering the art of layering, you'll stay comfortable and chic all season long."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is a terrible film, and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. The characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment. William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. Holden's character--the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally--is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre-hippie cool: the bachelor pad, the swinging hi-fi, the lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool, a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy.

Thriller is the sixth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 30, 1982, in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000. In just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. It produced seven singles—\\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", and \\"Thriller\\"—all of which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Movie plot: Hatari!The film opens before the credits with the members of the Momella Game Ltd. parked on the African plains scanning the landscape for rhino. Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job. The doctor asks them all to leave the hospital as they're only in the way.The party relocates to a bar where some time and several drinks later the doctor calls to inform them the Indian will be all right and should soon be on... Answer:","output":"In the movie Hatari!, the character Little Wolf, the Indian, is played by Bruce Cabot. He gets injured during the team's attempt to capture a rhino, and the group must find a suitable replacement for his role in the team. The person who is ultimately hired to replace the Indian is a young Frenchman named Charles Maurey, played by Gérard Blain. When Charles Maurey approaches the group, asking for the Indian's job, the team members initially react with anger and indignation, mainly due to the abruptness and insensitivity Charles shows by asking for the Indian's job while he's still in the hospital. However, when the doctor informs the team that the Indian needs a blood transfusion with a specific blood type, AB negative, Charles reveals that he has the same blood type and offers to help, but only if Kurt (Hardy Krüger) asks him to. Kurt swallows his pride and asks for Charles' help, and the Frenchman agrees to give the needed blood transfusion. In return, Sean Mercer (John Wayne), the team leader, invites Charles to their compound and offers him the possibility of joining the Momella Game Ltd. team, effectively replacing the Indian's role. Their initial impressions of Charles notwithstanding, he proves to be a valuable addition to their team, as his skills and knowledge in animal capture and conservation support their ongoing operations. However, it's important to consider more than just the plot of Hatari! when deciding whether to invest in the film proposal. You should take into account other factors such as the film's market potential, genre, target audience, and the talent behind it (i.e., actors, director, and producers). Additionally, evaluating the financial aspects, including the budget, expected return on investment, and potential distribution channels, will be crucial to making an informed decision on your investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the given paragraph and the hint provided, it cannot be determined which chair has a lower air pressure. The paragraph does not provide information about the difference in volume or pressure changes in the red and green chairs when Patrick and Mark sit on them.

Shocking moment man is shot in the chest by hitman at point-blank range injuring a nearby London schoolboy A YOUNG man took a bullet to the chest when he was dramatically shot down during an attempted gang hit that also saw a London schoolboy caught up in the violence. The 21-year-old victim was shot in the chest from a few yards away – leaving him with a punctured lung and a severely damaged windpipe. Today cops released CCTV footage showing him attempt to dive for cover behind a parked car as they hunt three suspects. The men, wanted on suspicion of attempted murder, were dressed in black hooded jackets and wearing face masks as they shot the 16-year-old schoolboy on their rampage. He was on his way to the library in Brixton on May 12 when he was blasted. Luckily he escaped without serious injuries after being rushed to a South London hospital. Today’s shocking footage shows the gunman take the sawn-off shotgun from his accomplice before opening fire from the middle of the street. The suspected gunman fled on a bicycle while the other two men escaped on foot. Officers say they want to speak to two passers-by who were threatened at gunpoint as the man made his escape. Detective Constable Jo Ross said: “The 21-year-old victim was fortunate to recover from what were potentially life-threatening injuries at the time of the incident. “Other passers-by were threatened by having a shotgun pointed at them – these are dangerous people. “We are keen for the public to give us any information in relation to this appeal, who witnessed the incident or who recognises the suspects. “It happened in broad daylight and in an area full of schoolchildren.” The suspects are all described as black men in their 20s wearing dark clothing.

I can use this background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).  Now, I have a new situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year.  Answer this question please: Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Danube river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea. Step-by-step justification: 1. Both the Danube and Volga rivers form large deltas, which implies that both rivers carry a significant amount of sediment and experience a decrease in velocity upon reaching their respective bodies of water. 2. The Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year compared to the Volga river delta. This indicates that the Danube river deposits more sediment in its delta than the Volga river does in its delta. 3. As mentioned in the background information, when a river's velocity decreases rapidly, it causes the river to deposit the majority, if not all, of its sediment load. This sediment buildup forms the river delta. 4. Since the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year, it can be inferred that the Danube river's velocity decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea, leading to a higher rate of sediment deposition compared to the Volga river."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there are not as many eggs used in the cake recipe, it can lead to a smaller cake with a different texture. The reduction in the number of eggs will have multiple effects on the overall outcome of the cake. First, the size of the cake may decrease primarily as a result of less volume being contributed by the eggs. Eggs, especially the egg whites, act as leavening agents. They help incorporate air into the batter when whipped, which in turn gives the cake its rise during the baking process. With fewer eggs, there will be less air incorporated into the batter, resulting in a smaller cake with reduced height. Secondly, eggs help hold the cake structure together. They provide moisture, richness, and act as binding agents in the batter. Therefore, a reduction in the number of eggs used may cause the cake to be less moist, less rich, and potentially more crumbly. This will affect the overall texture and quality of the cake, contributing to its smaller size. In terms of the perturbation caused by the change in the number of eggs used, it will have a significant influence on the second effect mentioned: the cake's texture. Using fewer eggs will have a direct effect on the structure of the cake, making it less moist, rich, and potentially more crumbly. This, in turn, will make the cake smaller. In conclusion, using fewer eggs than specified in a cake recipe will result in a smaller cake due to a reduction in the volume and a change in texture.

'Tales of Ennui,' directed by Caden Platitude, promised a thrilling and emotion-packed adventure but fails to deliver anything resembling a compelling narrative or memorable performances. One cannot help but leave the theater in a state of profound disappointment, questioning the time and energy they had invested in this lackluster experience. From the beginning, the film jumps from one disconnected scene to another, leaving the audience gasping for a sense of coherence or, at the very least, some semblance of a chronological sequence. The juxtaposition of unrelated events, intended to evoke an artistic and avant-garde style, comes across as confusing and amateur. The film's main character, James Bland (played by the typically engaging Leo Lackluster), is devoid of any growth or development. Audiences expecting a fully-fledged character arc will be frustrated as, for the full 127 minutes of screentime, James remains a one-dimensional persona. Even scenes that could have opened doors for character development are squandered with lazy writing and poor direction, rendering James a bland protagonist with whom viewers find it nearly impossible to connect. While the film's promotional material boasted of an extraordinary supporting cast, the potential of these talented actors is left untapped throughout. Stella Stiff's portrayal of James's love interest, Isabella Sterile, is reduced to a mere caricature instead of a breathing, complex character. Furthermore, the relationship between James and Isabella remains stagnant and unbelievable, stifling the energy that could have made them a fascinating duo to observe. As for the score, composer Dirk Dullville appears to have composed the movie's entire soundtrack with ill-fitted tones that fail to complement the scenes. Even pivotal, emotionally charged moments are diminished by heavy-handed and intrusive background music, making it difficult for the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative. The only aspect of 'Tales of Ennui' that deserves some praise is its cinematography. The vibrant color palette and striking visual imagery do catch the eye, but these fleeting moments of beauty are quickly marred by the film's overall incompetence. It is a shame to see such potential squandered on a film that struggles to maintain a cohesive and engaging storyline. In conclusion, 'Tales of Ennui' does not live up to its expectations, nor does it offer anything new or refreshing for audiences to enjoy. Despite its talented cast and mesmerizing visuals, it is let down by a confusing plot, lackluster performances, and an unexciting score. Ultimately, 'Tales of Ennui' is a monotonous misadventure that one would be better off avoiding in favor of a more compelling cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I promote Indian products by 1K walk campaign in a newly formed district? Advantages of H-Arm suspension? OPT: [+] no [+] yes","output":"No, these two questions have different meanings and pertain to two separate topics. Let's analyze each question in detail: 1. How do I promote Indian products by 1K walk campaign in a newly formed district? This question is related to marketing and promotional strategies. The person asking the question is seeking ideas or guidance on how to effectively promote Indian products by organizing a 1-kilometer walk campaign in a recently established district. The focus is on creating awareness and interest in Indian products by using an engaging physical activity to draw people's attention to the target brand or products. To answer this question, a detailed plan can be suggested, which may include the following steps: a. Identifying the target audience: Determine the demographic that would be most interested in the Indian products being promoted, such as age, gender, and interests. b. Choosing a suitable location: Find a suitable location within the newly formed district that is easily accessible, has ample space for the walk, and is frequented by the target audience. c. Collaborating with local authorities: Obtain necessary permissions and support from local authorities to organize the event. d. Publicizing the event: Utilize social media, print ads, posters, and word-of-mouth to spread the message about the 1K walk and the Indian products being promoted. e. Engaging the participants: Develop an engaging program during the walk, which may include product demonstrations, sampling, and information about the benefits of using Indian products. f. Post-event follow-up: Capture the contact details of the participants and engage with them after the event by sending updates, offers, and product news.  2. Advantages of H-Arm suspension? This question is focused on the automotive and mechanical engineering domain. H-Arm suspension, also known as double-wishbone suspension, is a type of independent suspension system used in vehicles. The person asking the question is interested in learning the benefits of implementing an H-Arm suspension system. To answer this question, the following advantages can be listed: a. Improved handling and stability: H-Arm suspension allows each wheel to move independently, providing superior handling, stability, and control, particularly during cornering or when driving on uneven surfaces. b. Better road contact: The design of the suspension system ensures that the wheel remains perpendicular to the road at all times, maintaining better tire contact with the surface. c. Reduced body roll: Due to the independent movement of each wheel, body roll is reduced, resulting in a more stable and comfortable driving experience. d. Adjustable suspension geometry: H-Arm suspension allows changes to suspension geometry, including camber, caster, and toe angles, enabling tuners and engineers to fine-tune the vehicle's handling characteristics according to specific needs. e. Better shock absorption: The suspension system is designed to absorb and dissipate shock and road vibrations effectively, delivering a smoother ride. f. Minimal wear and tear: Due to the proper load distribution and management of the suspension components, there is lesser wear and tear on both the suspension and the tires, which results in lower maintenance costs over time. In conclusion, the two questions have different meanings and pertain to separate domains. The former revolves around marketing a product, while the latter delves into the automotive engineering realm."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the best way to: To make easy monster feet for Where the Wild Things Are costume. Possible answers:  1). Spray paint boots..  2). Spray paint swimming flippers.. Answer:","output":"Answer: 2). Spray paint swimming flippers. To make easy monster feet for a \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" costume, using swimming flippers is the best approach as it provides a more convincing and unique appearance compared to boots.  Step-by-step process: 1. Choose a pair of swimming flippers: Pick a pair that fits comfortably and has a design suitable for the monster feet you want to create. Select flippers with a wide fin area to provide more space for painting and adding extra design elements. 2. Clean the flippers: Wash the flippers with soap and water, making sure they are free of dirt, grime, and any oily residue that may affect the adherence of the paint. Allow them to dry completely before proceeding. 3. Select the appropriate spray paint: Choose a spray paint that is specifically designed for plastic or rubber materials, ensuring better adhesion and durability. Pick colors that match the monster feet in the \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" book or your desired color scheme. 4. Use a primer (optional): Applying a primer designed for plastic or rubber surfaces can help the paint adhere better and make the final result more durable. Spray a thin, even coat of primer, and allow it to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Spray paint the flippers: In a well-ventilated area, apply the spray paint to the flippers in thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry before adding the next one. Be patient; rushing this process can cause the paint to drip or become uneven. Apply multiple coats until you achieve the desired color and opacity. 6. Add details: To give the monster feet a more authentic and detailed appearance, you can use a small brush and acrylic paint to add fur, scales, or other textures. You could also glue on additional materials (such as faux fur or foam) to enhance the design. 7. Seal the paint: After the paint is fully dry, apply a clear sealant specifically designed for the type of paint you used. This will help protect the paint job and ensure it lasts through multiple wearings of the costume. 8. Attach claws (optional): For an extra touch, you can create monster claws using materials such as craft foam or plastic. Attach these to the tips of the flippers using strong adhesive or needle and thread, being careful not to puncture the flipper material too deeply. By following these steps, you'll have a convincing pair of monster feet for your \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" costume, creating a fun and memorable outfit for any event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Statement 1 ('Premise'): A man sitting on the floor crying while another man is trying to comfort him.  Statement 2 : A man is trying to console his emotional friend.  Step 1: Identify common elements: Both scenarios include two men, with one trying to comfort or console the other.  Step 2: Analyzing the actions: In Statement 1, we have two actions - 'a man sitting on the floor crying' and 'another man trying to comfort him'. In Statement 2, there is the action of 'a man trying to console his emotional friend'. Step 3: Correlate the actions between statements: The action of 'trying to comfort or console' is common in both statements, and we can infer that 'crying' is an emotional state, which could align with the 'emotional friend' aspect in the second statement. Step 4: Discuss location and physical state:  The first statement mentions a man 'sitting on the floor', but the second statement does not provide any explicit detail about the physical state or location of the men. Conclusion:  The two circumstances share similarities, such as the presence of one man attempting to comfort or console an 'emotional' or 'crying' friend. While it seems plausible that 'A man is trying to console his emotional friend' could indeed mean 'a man sitting on the floor crying while another man is trying to comfort him', we cannot conclusively say that the premise is completely true, due to the lack of information about the physical state or location in Statement 2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the answer for the question: Who did the tourists regard as curiosities? from the following article ?  In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Decide what size cake you'd like to make and get out the number of pans you'll need. You'll typically need 2 or 3 pans. Then cut parchment paper to fit the inside of the pans or spray the inside of each pan with baking spray. Greasing or lining the pan will ensure that the cakes don't crumble or tear when you remove them.  For example, you could use 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) round cake pans. Since you bake several cakes you can either stack them and frost them to make thick layers, or slice each cake in half horizontally to make even more thin layers. For a homemade cake, choose your favorite recipe and mix the cake batter. Ensure that the cake will make as many layers as you need or plan on doubling the recipe. To save time, combine 2 purchased cake mixes according to the packaged instructions. You can make a layer cake that has the same flavor of cake layers or use a different flavor for each layer. Once you've mixed your cake batter, set a prepared cake pan on a digital scale. Spoon some of the batter in and then set another pan on the scale. Keep filling each of your cake pans while you weigh them so the batter is divided evenly. Dividing the batter evenly will ensure that all of your cake layers are the same thickness. around the outsides of the cake pans. Secure cake strips to the outside of each filled cake pan. If you don't have cake strips, tear an old kitchen towel into long strips and wet them. Wrap the damp strips around the outside of each filled cake pan. The cake strips or towel will help the cake bake slowly from the edges towards the center. This will prevent the cakes from forming domes in the center. To bake flat cakes that are easily to layer and frost, turn the oven temperature down and bake the cakes for a little longer. Doing these things will prevent the cakes from cooking quickly in the center and puffing up.  For example, if your recipe calls for baking the cakes for 30 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C), turn the oven down to 325 °F (163 °C) and bake them for 45 minutes. Plan on increasing the baking time by one half when you reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees. If you think the cakes have finished baking, insert a cake tester or toothpick into the center and pull it out. If it comes out clean and dry, the cakes are done. Then you can remove the cakes to cool completely. If the cake tester comes out with batter on it, return the cakes to the oven for a few minutes and check them again. Once the cakes are completely cooked, remove them from the oven and turn them out onto a wire rack to cool. When the cakes are at room temperature, cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 5 days. Chilling the cakes will make them easier to slice and frost. Never try cutting or trimming warm cakes because they'll tear more.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on making a layered cake, including selecting the appropriate size, preparing the pans, mixing the batter, evenly dividing the batter among the pans, using cake strips or damp towels to ensure even baking, adjusting oven temperature and baking time to prevent domes, testing for doneness, cooling the cakes, and chilling them before assembling and frosting, to ultimately create a visually appealing and delicious dessert."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you've edited the content of your resume as much as possible and you still need to cut some space, consider lowering the font size to 10.5 or even 10. Avoid going any smaller than that, however, because it will make your resume hard to read.  Make all the text in your resume the same size, rather than having the names of employers or schools larger than the rest of the text. If the labels or headings for the sections of your resume are larger than the rest of your text, you can also experiment with making them smaller. Try making them the same size as everything else. A good resume uses white space to break up text and allow for easy scanning. However, too much white space can push your resume over one page. You can adjust the line spacing in the text formatting menu on your word processing app. Decrease line spacing by the smallest increment possible. Make sure your words don't overlap and can still be read. You may want to print out your resume and see how it looks. Most word processing apps default to 1 in (2.5 cm)margins all the way around. However, you can typically get away with decreasing those margins to give more room for the text. Test your document by printing it before you send it to the potential employer to make sure it prints okay. Particularly if you're emailing your resume, there's a good chance your resume will never be printed on paper. However, you still want to make sure it's printable if necessary. Your word processing app defaults to a single column. However, it's possible to create 2 or even 3 columns on a document. If you're finding it difficult to get your resume down to a page, you may be able to use a 2 column or 3 column layout to get more information on the page. If you want to use multiple columns, you're better off starting a new document rather than simply converting the document you have.

The National Theatre's This House takes place largely in the government and opposition whips' inner sanctums as we follow the political machinations of the 1970s. This was a time when the whips - the MPs in charge of maintaining party discipline and winning parliamentary votes - certainly earned their salaries. Between 1974 and 1979, Labour was in government, but for much of the time it had no majority. That gives playwright James Graham a surprising amount of drama to work with. Indeed, the very survival of the Labour government depends on the whips delivering. Fail and they know Margaret Thatcher is ready to banish them from office. But just how real is this drama? To find out I invited someone with inside knowledge to see it on stage. Newcastle East's Labour MP Nick Brown did not enter the Commons until 1983, but he knows a thing or two about the whips' office. He was Tony Blair's first Chief Whip in 1997 and Gordon Brown's last in 2010. His challenge was rather different to that facing his 1970s counterparts though. He had a whacking Labour majority to work with in 1997, and it was still a secure one even at the end of New Labour's terms in office. But when he entered the engine room the tales of the Wilson and Callaghan whips were already legendary. In This House we see Labour MPs literally dragged off their death beds to maintain the government's majority. Seventeen Labour MPs - including one whip - died during the period, and the play suggests some at least were victims of the need to turn out at all costs. At one point, ministers are flown back from Northern Ireland in atrocious weather to prevent defeat. Nick Brown said: \\"All that is true. In the case of the two ministers, all civilian flights had been stopped. But they were flown back for the vote through a ferocious storm even though it put them and the military personnel who flew them back in great danger.\\" The play also highlights the class divide between Labour and Tory whips. Labour's are largely working class with little education beyond school. The Conservatives are ex-public school, ex-Oxbridge and ex-military. And even in his time, Nick Brown says that divide was still there. He said: \\"The only difference was that our whips had started going to university by then, but there was still a very different atmosphere between the two camps - with the opposition often from more privileged backgrounds. It was a rivalry, but there was respect there too.\\" Crucial to Labour efforts to stay in power were the whips' relations with the \\"odds and sods\\" - the Liberals, and the nationalist and unionist parties in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Unlike today there was no formal coalition, but bar-room deals had to be done to secure their votes. Nick Brown had no need to cultivate such alliances. Labour's 1997 majority was 179 and even by the end of Gordon Brown's time it was over 60. But he still liked to meet the smaller parties to gauge their views and keep them as potential voting allies so recognises the need to build relationships across the house. In This House though, the Labour whips have as much trouble with their own side. As well as dealing with the mentally-unstable John Stonehouse - who disappears, reappears and then resigns - there are serial rebels who threaten to bring the government down. That was something Nick Brown could certainly relate to. As we watched, he joked that dealing with MPs as Chief Whip wasn't too far removed from dealing with livestock in one of his other roles as agriculture minister. He said: \\"Whips are really the government's business managers, and the real challenge is to get legislation through in the face of adversity. Your crucial relationship is with the Prime Minister who has to trust you to deliver.\\" And in This House the Labour whips do deliver almost to the end. Only in the dying days of office in 1979 does Labour lose the vote of confidence that ushers in a general election and 18 years of opposition. But it's in the twists and turns of the previous five years, and the pitting of wits between the rival offices that makes the play edge-of-the-seat entertaining. It's creatively staged and also very funny, and avoids getting bogged down in the rather rarefied gentlemen's agreements between the rival offices. Playwright James Graham interviewed many of the participants during his research and that shows. And unlike the monstrous Francis Urquhart in House of Cards, these whips are real people who want to win but not ultimately at all costs. In the end it's an act of compassion by a Labour whip towards an ailing colleague that the play suggests caused the loss of the crucial vote. Nick Brown said: \\"It works as a terrifically-entertaining piece of theatre. It takes a very complex and taut political situation and breaks it down, and makes it understandable even 40 years on. \\"The human side comes across very strongly. Everything in it may not literally be true, but it has a sense of truth about what it's like to be in the whips' offices, and what it must have been like then.\\" And of course This House throws the spotlight onto the politicians we as the public should never see. The whips who have to get things done. But would Nick Brown have liked or loathed the challenge of governing without a majority? He thinks for a second, and then with a hint of relish, he says: \\"Absolutely everything they did, we would have done I'm sure. \\"Yes, I think I would have enjoyed it.\\" This House runs at the National Theatre in London until 15 May, and a performance will be shown at cinemas around the UK on 16 May. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The National Theatre's play, \\"This House,\\" brings to life the drama inside the government and opposition whips' offices during the 1970s, and focuses particularly on the Labour government that was struggling without a majority. This play exemplifies the pressure and desperation to win political support, as Labour MPs were allegedly dragged off their death beds to maintain the government's majority. The play also highlights the class divide between Labour and Tory whips, as well as their efforts to maintain alliances and secure votes.

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.  _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey.

Question: Who built the Luna Temple Movie title: Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life Movie plot: The film begins on Santorini island, Greece, during a wedding when it is interrupted by an earthquake. The earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple, built by Alexander the Great to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss. It is revealed that the medallion Lara also recovered from Chen Lo shows how to unlock the information in the Orb; a certain arrangement of musical sounds. Meanwhile, Lara and Terry begin to fall in love again; but Lara starts to back away from him knowing that she could easily kill him if he betrays her. She seduces him one morning, then leaves him handcuffed to a bedpost, saying \\"I'm not leaving because I can't kill you; I'm leaving because I could.\\"Lara finds her... A:","output":"The Luna Temple was built by Alexander the Great, a historical figure known for his military prowess and leadership in ancient Greece and beyond. The temple was constructed as a place to house Alexander's most prized treasures, which were protected and concealed from outsiders. The movie, \\"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,\\" stars Angelina Jolie as the intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft. The plot involves Lara uncovering the Luna Temple after an earthquake on the Greek island of Santorini. Within the temple, she discovers a mysterious glowing orb and a medallion, both of which are essential to the narrative. The film's antagonist, crime lord Chen Lo (portrayed by Simon Yam), steals these valuable artifacts from Lara. Lara is then tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an ancient object containing a deadly plague, before bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (played by Ciarán Hinds) can obtain it. To prevent Reiss from unleashing the plague, Lara must track down Chen Lo and the stolen orb, as it provides a map to the location of Pandora's Box in the Cradle of Life. During her quest, Lara enlists the help of Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former lover, mercenary, and Royal Marine who was previously imprisoned in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They journey to China, where they engage in a series of action-packed sequences, including a fight scene in the suburbs of Shanghai and an exhilarating jump off a skyscraper in Hong Kong. Throughout the film, Lara and Terry begin to rekindle their romance, adding emotional depth to the narrative. However, Lara remains wary of Terry, fearing that he may betray her and that she might be forced to kill him. Despite their growing connection, Lara decides to leave Terry behind, having handcuffed him to a bedpost to prevent him from following her. Towards the end of the movie, it's revealed that the medallion Lara discovered earlier holds the key to unlocking the information contained within the orb. This revelation brings the story full circle, connecting the artifacts found in the Luna Temple with the dangerous mission to locate and secure Pandora's Box. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, consider factors such as the appeal of the storyline, the potential for box-office success given its action-adventure genre, and the star power of its cast, such as Angelina Jolie in the leading role. Additionally, evaluate the film's expected production costs, marketing strategy, and potential target audience to make an informed decision about its financial potential."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Deborah Anne \\"Debby\\" Boone (born September 22, 1956), is an American singer, author, and actress. She is best known for her 1977 hit, \\"You Light Up My Life\\", which spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year. Boone later focused her music career on country music resulting in the 1980 No. 1 country hit \\"Are You on the Road to Lovin' Me Again\\". In the 1980s, she recorded Christian music which garnered her four top 10 Contemporary Christian albums as well as two more Grammys. With her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer Mike Curb to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, \\"You Light Up My Life\\" (which had been featured in the film of the same name) in 1977. The song became the biggest hit of the 1970s spending ten consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 -- longer than any other song in Hot 100 history to that point. (In 2008, Billboard ranked the song No. 7 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.) The song earned Boone a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop Single of 1977. She also received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female and Record of the Year won by, respectively, Barbra Streisand (\\"Love Theme From \\"A Star Is Born\\" (Evergreen)\\") and the Eagles (\\"Hotel California\\"). \\"You Light Up My Life\\" also succeeded on Billboard's Adult Contemporary (No. 1 for one week) and Country (No. 4) singles charts. The single and the album (No. 6 Pop, No. 6 Country) of the same name were both certified platinum.  The song, written and produced by Joe Brooks, was from the film of the same name. Brooks earned Song of the Year awards at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song. (Boone performed the song at both awards shows.) Boone's version was not used in the movie or featured on its soundtrack. The song was lip-synched in the film by its star, Didi Conn, performing to vocals recorded by Kacey Cisyk. It was written as a love song, but Boone interpreted the song as inspirational and stated that she recorded the song for God.  Boone's overnight success led to a tour with her father and frequent television appearances, but she was unable to maintain her success in pop music after \\"You Light Up My Life\\". Her follow-up single, \\"California\\" (also written and produced by Joe Brooks), peaked at No. 50 Pop and No. 20 AC. \\"California\\" was included on Boone's second album, Midstream, which faltered at No. 147 Pop. Her next single, the double-sided \\"God Knows\\"/\\"Baby I'm Yours\\", also struggled, peaking at No. 74 Pop, becoming her last entry on the Hot 100. However, the single charted AC (No. 14) and returned Boone to the country chart (No. 22). Boone then released another movie theme, \\"When You're Loved\\", from The Magic of Lassie. Like \\"You Light Up My Life\\", the song was nominated for an Academy Award for its composers, the Sherman Brothers, but it failed to replicate the success of her first single charting only No. 48 AC. Boone's wholesome persona contrasted with the image-conscious pop-music industry, leading her career in different musical directions. Did it win any awards?","output":"Yes, Debby Boone's \\"You Light Up My Life\\" won several awards and garnered multiple nominations for her and the song's writer and producer, Joe Brooks. In 1978, it earned Boone a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Joe Brooks received the Song of the Year award at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song. Additionally, Boone received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female and Record of the Year. However, those were won by Barbra Streisand for \\"Love Theme From \\"A Star Is Born\\" (Evergreen)\\" and the Eagles for \\"Hotel California,\\" respectively.

Title: One of Will Smith's best Review: Spoiler Alert!Will Smith stars in a movie that is worth all the hype. In marketing this movie, they did a good job to show absolutely nothing as to intrigue audiences. Even though this is technically a remake, it stands up by itself as if it wasn't.The plot is masterfully crafted . The end was somewhat expected, as finding a cure would be only the way to go, but Smith dying was totally unexpected, at least in my opinion.There is little to gripe about this one. But what needs to be griped about is the insanely bad CG. In this age where every other cartoon movie is CG, to have such horrendous animation is inexcusable. I guess all the budget for the movie went into paying Will Smith.Another thing people complained about was how Will Smith seemed to act like himself.

Of course, he delivered   more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write a note -- \\"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\\". Then she put the note and the empty bottles into the milk box. The next day, the buttermilk would magically appear. There was also a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box in the house, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery. I am sad that there is no home milk delivery today.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - William Aberhart (December 30, 1878  May 23, 1943), also known as Bible Bill for his outspoken Baptist views, was a Canadian politician and the seventh Premier of Alberta (1935 to his death in 1943). He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses.  - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C. H.\\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879  29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.  - Rachel Anne Notley (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian politician and the 17th and current Premier of Alberta, since 2015. She is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Edmonton-Strathcona, and leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party. The daughter of former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley, Notley's career before politics focused on labour law, with a specialty in workers' compensation advocacy and workplace health and safety issues.  - Social credit is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\"  - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies.  - The Bow River is a river in the Canadian province of Alberta. It begins in the Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river's banks, is considered a part of Calgary's self-image.  - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about .

Amy loved being around people, but Maria found it exhausting. So after a lot of thought, they both decided that Amy would go to the party alone, while Maria would stay at home and enjoy a quiet night in. This way, both of them could have a good time in their own way. Amy was excited about the party and spent hours deciding what to wear and how to style her hair. She finally settled on a chic red dress and let her wavy locks flow freely. As she left the house, she waved goodbye to Maria, who was already curled up on the couch with her favorite book and a cup of hot chocolate. The party was held at a magnificent townhouse and was hosted by their high school friend, Emily. The townhouse was beautifully decorated for the occasion, with sparkling fairy lights strung across the walls, and lively music filled the air. The scent of delightful food wafted through the rooms, and people chatted while enjoying their beverages. Amy enthusiastically mingled with the crowd, striking up conversations with both friends and strangers. She danced to her favorite songs, laughed at hilarious stories, and reconnected with people she hadn't seen in years. Her charismatic nature drew people in, and soon she was the life of the party. Meanwhile, Maria relished in the peacefulness of her solitude. She became completely absorbed in her book, periodically sipping on her hot chocolate nestled in a cozy blanket. The soft flicker of candlelight filled the room, creating a serene ambiance in which Maria could indulge in her love for literature. Every once in a while, she would glance at the clock and wonder how Amy was doing, but she was confident that her friend was having a great time at the party. As the night wore on, Amy began to feel exhausted from all the excitement. She decided it was time to head home. Upon her return, Maria eagerly asked her how the party went. Amy gushed about the fantastic evening she'd had, recounting the funny anecdotes and sharing the gossip she'd heard. Maria listened intently, grinning as she relived the night vicariously through Amy's stories. Both of them ended up having an excellent night. Amy's outing to the party had given her the opportunity to revel in her love for social gatherings, and Maria's quiet night in allowed her to enjoy her introverted nature without feeling pressured. Their ability to appreciate each other's differences led to a deeper understanding of their friendship and made them all the more grateful to have one another in their lives. As they settled down for the night, Amy and Maria knew that they would always cherish the memory of that night. It proved that no matter how different they were, their friendship would remain steadfast, allowing them to support and respect each other's preferences - all while having the best time in their own unique ways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Unlike the rest of the UK, Stormont parties are not required to reveal the sources of their funding. This is due to concerns about the security of donors. But the political and security context had \\"changed significantly\\" since the last consultation, said Mr Brokenshire. \\"Voters in Northern Ireland will also welcome more information about how their political parties are funded,\\" he said. \\"I would now like to seek views on whether the time is now right to move towards full transparency on donations and loans and to implement a change to the rules as soon as possible, bringing Northern Ireland into step with the wider UK.\\" The Electoral Commission said it welcomed the announcement. \\"We have consistently called for increased transparency on how political parties are funded in Northern Ireland,\\" it said in a statement. \\"Such a move will only help to increase public confidence in the democratic process. \\"We look forward to hearing the outcome of this consultation and are ready to work closely with the NIO (Northern Ireland Office) to progress this issue.\\" Steven Agnew and Clare Bailey of the Green Party in Northern Ireland discussed the issue with officials from the NIO on Thursday. Mr Agnew said that while \\"donations continue to go unpublished, voters are denied the opportunity to understand the links between businesses and our politicians\\". He said the party would respond in \\"a positive way\\" to the invitation. Earlier this week, Belfast City councillors voted in support of a call to reveal the names of those who make large donations to Northern Ireland politicians. Alliance wants NI to be brought in line with Great Britain where names of those who donate over Â£7,500 are published. When Alliance leader Naomi Long was an MP she  secured legislative change that paved the way for the possible future identification of donors who contributed more than Â£7,500 since January 2014.

Answer:","output":"The Austrian scientist who is considered the founder of genetics is Gregor Johann Mendel. Born on July 20, 1822, in Heinzendorf, Austrian Silesia (now Hynčice, Czech Republic), Mendel was a pioneer in the field of genetics, thanks to his groundbreaking work on the inheritance of traits in pea plants, which laid the foundation for our modern understanding of genetic inheritance and the principles of heredity. Mendel grew up in a farming family and began studying plant breeding at an early age. He later joined the Augustinian St. Thomas Monastery in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), where he continued his education in mathematics, physics, and natural sciences. His monastic and scientific education allowed him to pursue his passion for understanding the natural world and its underlying phenomena. In 1856, Mendel began his famous experiments with pea plants in the monastery's garden. Over the course of eight years, Mendel conducted extensive research, cultivating around 29,000 pea plants and meticulously observing the inheritance of seven different characteristics in the process. These pea plant experiments led him to formulate some of the key principles of genetics, which are now known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. These laws include the Law of Segregation, the Law of Independent Assortment, and the Law of Dominance. The Law of Segregation states that during the formation of sex cells (gametes), the two copies of a gene for a particular trait, inherited from each parent, separate and only one gene from each pair is transmitted to the offspring. The Law of Independent Assortment states that the inheritance of one characteristic is independent of the inheritance of other characteristics. And finally, the Law of Dominance states that in a heterozygous organism (an organism with two different forms of a gene for a trait), the dominant form of the gene is expressed, while the recessive form is masked. Mendel published his findings in 1866 in a paper titled \\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\\" in the journal Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn. Unfortunately, his work initially went largely unrecognized, as it was not widely distributed or understood by the scientific community at the time. It was only around the turn of the 20th century, nearly two decades after his death in 1884, that Mendel's research was rediscovered, and the significance of his findings became more widely recognized. Mendel's work has had a profound impact on our understanding of genetics, laying the foundation for the modern science of genetics, which is integral to such fields as biology, agriculture, medicine, and many other aspects of human life. Even today, Gregor Mendel's concepts of heredity and dominant and recessive genes are central to the understanding of how traits are inherited and how genetic disorders can be passed down through generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the purpose of asking questions in a diary. − Diaries are places to reflect on and express thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Asking questions can lead to deep insights and self-awareness. Step 2: Think about which areas of your life you'd like to explore. − Personal growth, relationships, goals, and emotional wellbeing are common themes in diary entries. Step 3: Generate a list of open-ended questions related to these areas. Some good questions to ask yourself in your diary might include: 1. What am I grateful for today? 2. How can I improve my relationships? 3. What is a goal I want to work towards and why? 4. What is currently causing me stress and how can I address it? 5. How have I grown or changed recently? Second question: What is the best question you can ask yourself? Step 1: Consider that \\"best\\" is subjective and context-dependent. − What might be the best question for one person might not be the same for another, and the value of a question can vary depending on the situation or context. Step 2: Identify a question with broad applicability and potential for significant self-reflection. A possible contender for the best question one can ask themselves is: \\"What is my purpose in life and how can I align my actions with that purpose?\\" Are these two questions asking the same thing? Step 1: Compare the intent and focus of each question. − The first question seeks a list of good questions for diary entries, while the second question seeks a singular, outstanding question for self-reflection. Step 2: Assess the overlap in content. − While both questions concern self-reflection, the first question deals specifically with diary entries and generating a list, while the second question aims for a single, universal question.

Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When water touches an iron object, it creates an environment for the corrosion process to begin. Water acts as a medium for oxygen to interact with iron, leading to chemical reactions, which ultimately cause rust formation. 2. Water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: The water on an iron surface reacts as a solvent for carbon dioxide from the surrounding environment. When CO2 dissolves in water, it forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3), lowering the pH and making the solution acidic.  3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The mildly acidic solution begins to dissolve iron, breaking it down into iron ions (Fe2+), which leaves the surface of the iron object more vulnerable. The acidity levels determine the pace of this dissolution process.  4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: Water molecules undergo a process called reduction in the presence of iron, breaking down into hydrogen and hydroxide ions (OH-). In this process, hydrogen ions (H+) are released from the solution and electrons from iron help to reduce water into hydrogen gas (H2).  5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: Meanwhile, the oxygen present in the environment reacts with the iron ions (Fe2+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) to create iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2).  6. They form iron oxide, which is rust: The iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) further reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide or hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3⋅nH2O), which is rust. This reaction is an oxidation process where iron loses electrons and bonds with oxygen, becoming less stable and more permeable. In conclusion, if the erosion process accelerates, it exposes more of the iron surface to the water and other environmental conditions, leading to increased contact with water and carbon dioxide. As a result, more carbonic acid forms, which then intensifies the rate of iron dissolution and the formation of iron oxides—thus causing more rust.

Martial arts Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Last Phoenix\\" Plot Summary: In a world where chaos and destruction have become the new normal, an ancient martial arts academy, known as the Phoenix Academy, stands as the last hope for humanity's survival. The Academy aims to train students in various martial arts, focusing on mastering the body, spirit, and mind to combat the growing darkness. As the threat of a powerful and ruthless warlord steadily increases, the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of a new generation of fighters. Act 1: The film opens with a panoramic view of the once-thriving Phoenix Academy, now in need of new students to keep the tradition of martial arts alive. Master Liu (the academy's headmaster) and his team of instructors travel to remote villages, scouting for young and talented individuals. Among these new recruits, we meet Jade, a headstrong young woman with exceptional natural fighting abilities and Kai, a sensitive yet resolute young man with mysterious origins. As the new students settle into the academy, they quickly find friendships and rivalries among their peers. The rigorous training begins, with each student learning the ancient techniques of various martial arts disciplines, along with lessons on strategy, discipline, and self-control. Though initially challenged, Jade and Kai quickly emerge as the top students, gaining the attention of Master Liu. Act 2: A sudden turn of events alters the course of the story when the warlord, General Fang, threatens to take over nearby villages. Having heard of the Phoenix Academy's legendary martial arts skills, he demands that they bow to his rule or face destruction. Amidst fear and uncertainty, Master Liu refuses to yield to the tyranny of General Fang, declaring that the academy will fight against him. With the stakes higher than ever, Jade, Kai, and their fellow students must delve deeper into their training, mastering not only their physical skills but also their mental prowess and spiritual strength. As they prepare for the impending battle, Jade and Kai learn more about themselves and their individual connections to the academy's ancient Phoenix legend. Kai discovers he is the last descendant of a storied lineage of warriors. Jade learns that her parents were former students who perished trying to protect the academy from a previous threat. Act 3: In the final act, the climactic battle between the Phoenix Academy and General Fang's forces begins. Armed with their martial arts skills and the spirit of resilience, the students face seemingly insurmountable odds as they fight together in an epic and heart-pounding conclusion. Jade and Kai, now the academy's strongest fighters, come face-to-face with General Fang in an intense battle. They utilize their newly-mastered skills and unleash the legendary Phoenix power, ultimately defeating the evil warlord and saving their beloved academy. As peace is restored and the rebuilding process begins, Master Liu, inspired and proud of their accomplishments, beseeches his students to continue their martial arts training and spread the knowledge they've gained. The film closes with Jade and Kai taking on the roles of instructors at the Phoenix Academy, vowing to carry on the traditions and protect the world from future threats. \\"The Last Phoenix\\" tells the story of self-discovery, perseverance, and the power of unity through the ancient art of martial arts, making it a captivating and inspiring tale for all audiences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available options:  (A). yes  (B). it is not possible to tell  (C). no","output":"(A) Yes Based on the given premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration\\" is true. Let's break down the key components of the premise and hypothesis to explain this conclusion further. The premise states that the belief in the divine origin of the Torah, that is, the belief that it was written by the almighty, has become a matter of faith once again. This suggests that for someone to accept the divine authorship of the Torah, they must have faith in the existence of a higher power responsible for its creation. Now, let's consider the hypothesis: \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration.\\" The word \\"consideration\\" here can be interpreted as referring to accepting the divine origin of the Torah. Therefore, the hypothesis suggests that faith is a necessary factor for individuals to accept the idea that the Torah has a divine origin. Taking into account the premise, if believing in the divine authorship of the Torah is indeed a matter of faith, it would follow that faith is necessary for individuals to accept the Torah as divinely inspired. This proposed relationship wherein faith is a requirement for the acceptance of the Torah fits the hypothesis's claim that the Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration. Hence, based on the premise provided, the hypothesis \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration\\" would be true, making option (A) the correct choice. It is important to note, however, that this conclusion assumes that the premise accurately reflects the way individuals approach their belief in the divine origin of the Torah.

Nomani is a former Wall Street Journal reporter and a co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement. Masih Alinejad is a journalist and founder of My Stealthy Freedom, a campaign to oppose compulsory headscarves in Iran. Follow them on Twitter at @AsraNomani and @MasihPooyan. Last week, FIDE, the international chess federation, quietly announced that Iran would host next year’s Women’s World Chess Championship, which means contestants will have to cover their hair with scarves to comply with a “modesty” law fundamentalist clerics put in place after the 1979 Islamic revolution. As British Grandmaster Nigel Short spread the news, expressing concern, the 2016 U.S. champion, Nazi Paikidze-Barnes, a Georgian American, made a morally courageous move: Paikidze said she would skip the competition rather than comply with a law that denies women and girls fundamental human rights. “I will NOT wear a hijab and support women’s oppression. Even if it means missing one of the most important competitions of my career,” the chess champion said. To us, Paikidze should not have to boycott the tournament, which an Iranian Woman Grandmaster said would hurt the progress of women’s chess in the country. Instead, Iran should respect her choice, make the headscarf optional and lift its ban on women who choose not to cover their hair. The 22-year-old U.S. chess champion’s sincere protest is a remarkable checkmate to the government of Iran and other fundamentalist elements in our Muslim societies, who peddle “hijab” as a virtual sixth pillar of Islam for women. It also raises fresh scrutiny about a chess federation already under fire for corruption. Last November, the Treasury Department sanctioned FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a Russian businessman, for “materially assisting” and representing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. In a countermove, Susan Polgar, the Hungarian-born American chair of FIDE’s Commission for Women’s Chess, said she has “respect” for “cultural differences,” even noting the “beautiful choices” of scarves Iranian organizers provided women in the past. Thank you, but no, thank you. While American liberals call out the “slut shaming” of beauty queen Alicia Machado, they too often sacrifice their values and stay silent on the idea of the hijab. Paikidze’s protest is a welcome departure from politicians, journalists, nonprofit leaders and fashion designers who express, for lack of a better word, a hijab fetish, which romanticizes and normalizes the hijab. Indeed, hijab fetishists are like pawns for the clerics, blinded to the fact that the hijab is a symbol of sexism, misogyny and purity culture. This week, Paikidze posted a petition to FIDE that has been winning new signatories every few minutes. On Instagram, she wrote “a message to the people of Iran,” expressing her love for them and saying, “I stand for freedom of religion and choice. I’m protesting FIDE’s decision not because of Iran’s religion or people, but for the government’s laws that are restricting my rights as a woman.” In our struggle for the soul of Islam, this young chess champion’s courage emboldens us, because like-minded liberals too often stay silent, afraid of being called “Islamophobic” or intolerant of “diversity.” Too many liberals accept discrimination in the name of Islam, leaving reform-minded Muslims and others hanging. The idea of the hijab hinges on the false premise that women’s and girls’ hair is part of our sexual being and must be covered to protect our honor and chastity and shield “weak” men and boys from temptation. But as journalist Hala Arafa, an Egyptian American, has analyzed, “hijab” or a derivative of the word appears only eight times in the Koran and never in reference to head covering. Compulsory hijab is not part of our culture. Yet women are criminals in Iran if they remove their headscarves to feel the wind in their hair. Forcing women to cover their hair imposes a false identity on us. For years, a battery of Iranian clerics had the advantage of the bully pulpit, boasting that women embraced the hijab, but, since the launch of the #MyStealthyFreedom campaign, thousands of women have posted selfies without headscarves, showing the emptiness of the mullahs’ claim. As many liberals and Muslims shiver at the idea of a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Iran is banning women such as Paikidze who don’t believe in covering their hair. She won the right to compete in a world championship that Iran won the right to host. In the spirit of a history that welcomed seafarers, spice traders, merchants and orphans through the span of the Persian Empire, Iran has a choice on its next move: continue its ban or host a world championship that accepts a young chess champion from America, as she is, brilliant, dynamic, collegial — and scarf-less.

Step 1: Definition The Presbyterian Church is a Protestant Christian denomination that is part of the larger Reformed tradition. It is characterized by a distinct form of governance, which involves a representative system with elders or presbyters as the decision-making body. Step 2: Research historical origins The Presbyterian Church has its roots in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, particularly in the teachings of John Calvin and other Reformed theologians.  Step 3: Identify the founder It's important to note that the Presbyterian Church did not have a single founder. However, the Scottish reformer John Knox is considered to be one of the key figures in the development of Presbyterianism. In the 16th century, he studied under John Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, and later returned to Scotland, where he played a crucial role in the establishment of the Church of Scotland, which eventually evolved into the global Presbyterian movement. Conclusion: John Knox is often referred to as the founder of the Presbyterian Church due to his significant influence on the development and spread of Presbyterianism as a distinct Reformed denomination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A consultation document linked to the proposed Trade Union Bill suggests unions involved in industrial action should give two weeks notice if they plan to campaign via social media. Frances O'Grady said an attack on trade unions was \\"unfinished business\\" for \\"some elements within governments\\". Ministers said any restrictions would not apply to posts by individuals.

However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride. Marilla Cuthbert is shocked and beside herself to know how she will ever cope with this sensitive, headstrong child so desperate to fit in. But shy, gentle Matthew is always there to defend Anne and hold her up on a pedestal. It seems like Anne is destined to cultivate disaster. She becomes \\"bosom\\" friends with Diana Barry from across the pond and succeeds in getting Diana drunk by accidentally serving currant wine instead of raspberry cordial at a tea party. Diana's mother and Rachel Lynde turn on Marilla for making wine in the first place. Anne moves from one mishap to the next as her wild imagination and far-fetched antics combine to constantly land her in trouble.  Guess a valid title for it!

What did the audience watch? Options: - show - theatre - arena - presentation - concert hall  The answer is \\"presentation\\" because","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given information The statement \\"The audience listened raptly\\" indicates that the audience was highly focused and engrossed in what they were experiencing. Additionally, the phrase \\"They learned much from this\\" suggests that the event provided the audience with new information or knowledge. Step 2: Evaluate the provided options We need to determine which of the given options best fits the context provided by the statement. The options are show, theatre, arena, presentation, and concert hall. Option 1: Show - A show typically includes various forms of entertainment but may not necessarily focus on providing new information or knowledge. Option 2: Theatre - Theatres host various forms of performing arts (e.g. plays, musicals) that tend to primarily entertain but might not primarily aim to teach something new. Option 3: Arena - An arena is a large, enclosed space where public sports or entertainment events occur. This option doesn't relate directly to the type of event. Option 4: Presentation - A presentation is generally an organized delivery of information, often accompanied by visual aids, designed to teach or inform the audience about a particular topic. Option 5: Concert hall - A concert hall typically hosts musical performances, which tend to entertain audiences but do not generally provide them with new information or knowledge.

A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. Problem:Target: commander  The commander called for one of his subordinates. She was very shy and quiet.

A commander is typically associated with strong leadership, assertiveness, and decision-making skills.  Next, I analyzed the second sentence, \\"She was very shy and quiet.\\" I considered how this description relates to the commonly held notions of a commander. Being shy and quiet goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a commander who is expected to be strong and assertive in their leadership style.

The first sentence: \\"In 2004, SCA acquired International Paper 's Tissue and Hygiene products businesses from Carter Holt Harvey.\\" In this sentence, the focus is placed primarily on the fact that SCA acquired the \\"Tissue and Hygiene products businesses.\\" The ownership of these businesses by International Paper is also emphasized, as well as the fact that they were purchased from Carter Holt Harvey. The second sentence: \\"In 2004 SCA acquired the tissue and hygiene products businesses of International Paper from Carter Holt Harvey.\\" In this version of the sentence, the acquisition of the businesses is still focused on, but the phrasing suggests a slight shift in emphasis.

It increases cellular respiration.. 4. It reduces water intake by roots..","output":"To choose the correct answer, let's analyze each option: 1. It increases photosynthesis: Closing stomata reduces the intake of carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis. So, this option doesn't seem to help the plant during wilting. 2. It reduces further water loss: Closing the stomata will prevent water from escaping through the process of transpiration. This seems like a helpful response during wilting, as it helps conserve water. 3. It increases cellular respiration: While cellular respiration is essential for the plant's energy production, it's not related to the stomata's function during wilting. 4. It reduces water intake by roots: The stomata are found on the plant's leaves, not its roots. Their closure doesn't directly affect the root's water intake.

Sentence: \\"I noticed him kissing Mary.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would indeed rate the sentence \\"I noticed him kissing Mary\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This assessment is based on factors such as word order, syntax, grammaticality, and communicative effectiveness that linguists analyze when evaluating sentences. 1. Word Order: In English, the standard word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This sentence follows this norm; the subject ('I') appears before the verb ('noticed'), which in turn precedes the object ('him kissing Mary'). 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence is also compliant with English rules. It features a main clause with a subject ('I') and a transitive verb ('noticed'). The verb 'noticed' requires an object, which in this case is a non-finite clause ('him kissing Mary'). This structure is perfectly acceptable within the English language. 3. Grammaticality: The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of tense agreement, pronoun usage, and verb transitivity. The past tense of the verb 'to notice' ('noticed') corresponds to an action that was observed in the past. The pronoun 'him' is used appropriately, as the indirect object 'kissing Mary' refers to the person originally mentioned. Finally, the verb 'kissing' is a gerund, making it suitable to function as an object in the sentence. 4. Communicative Effectiveness: In terms of conveying meaning, the sentence is coherent and unambiguous. It presents a clear picture of the situation: the speaker observed a male individual kissing Mary. In context, this would be easily understood by most, if not all, English speakers. In conclusion, a linguist would consider the sentence \\"I noticed him kissing Mary\\" to be acceptable linguistically, as it is compliant with English word order, syntax, and grammatical rules, and effectively communicates the intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was commenced by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V in a series of military campaigns extending from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Ferdinand the Catholic was in 1512 both king of Aragon and regent of Castile. When Pope Julius II declared a Holy League against France in late 1511, Navarre tried to remain neutral. Ferdinand used this as an excuse to attack Navarre, conquering it while its potential protector France was beset by England, Venice, and Ferdinand's Italian armies. Several attempts were made to reconquer Iberian Navarre starting right after the Castilian invasion , notably a halfhearted reconquest attempt in 1516 and a fully-fledged French-Navarrese reconquest campaign in 1521. All were defeated by the Spanish, and clashes came to halt to the north of the Pyrenees in 1528, when the Spanish troops withdrew from Lower Navarre. The Treaty of Cambrai between Spain and France in 1529 sealed the division of Navarre along the Pyrenees, while the independent Kingdom of Navarre survived in Lower Navarre ruled by the lineage of the Albrets united to their principality of Béarn, showing close links with France. The kingdom was absorbed into France in 1620 . Question: Who continued the Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre?

Topazes ran in a foamy stream Over the cover, the hands were studded With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded.

Alice Hamilton (February 27, 1869 - September 22, 1970) was an American physician, research scientist, and author who is best known as a leading expert in the field of occupational health and a pioneer in the field of industrial toxicology. She was also the first woman appointed to the faculty of Harvard University. Her scientific research focused on the study of occupational illnesses and the dangerous effects of industrial metals and chemical compounds. In addition to her scientific work, Hamilton was a social-welfare reformer, humanitarian, peace activist, and a resident-volunteer at Hull House in Chicago. In January 1919 Hamilton accepted a position as assistant professor in a newly-formed Department of Industrial Medicine (and after 1925 the School of Public Health) at Harvard Medical School, making her the first woman appointed to the Harvard University faculty in any field. Her appointment was hailed by the New York Tribune with the headline: \\"A Woman on Harvard Faculty--The Last Citadel Has Fallen--The Sex Has Come Into Its Own\\". Her own comment was \\"Yes, I am the first woman on the Harvard faculty--but not the first one who should have been appointed!\\"  During her years at Harvard, from 1919 to her retirement in 1935, Hamilton never received a faculty promotion and held only a series of three-year appointments. At her request, the half-time appointments for which she taught one semester per year allowed her to continue her research and spend several months of each year at Hull House. Hamilton also faced discrimination as a woman. She was excluded from social activities, could not enter the Harvard Union, attend the Faculty Club, or receive a quota of football tickets. In addition, Hamilton was not allowed to march in the university's commencement ceremonies as the male faculty members did.  Hamilton became a successful fundraiser for Harvard as she continued to write and conduct research on the dangerous trades. In addition to publishing \\"landmark reports for the U.S. Department of Labor\\" on research related to workers in Arizona copper mines and stonecutters at Indiana's limestone quarries, Hamilton also wrote Industrial Poisons in the United States (1925), the first American textbook on the subject, and another related textbook, Industrial Toxicology (1934). At tetraethyl lead conference in Washington, D.C. in 1925, Hamilton was the most prominent critic of adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline.  Hamilton also remained an activist in social reform efforts. Her specific interests in civil liberties, peace, birth control, and protective labor legislation for women caused some of her critics to consider her a \\"radical\\" and a \\"subversive.\\" From 1924 to 1930, she served as the only woman member of the League of Nations Health Committee. She also visited the Soviet Union in 1924 and Nazi Germany in April 1933. Hamilton wrote \\"The Youth Who Are Hitler's Strength,\\" which was published in The New York Times. The article described Nazi exploitation of youth in the years between the two world wars. She also criticized the Nazi education, especially its domestic training for girls.

In the premise, it is mentioned that San'doro looked at Jon from under his hood, with a line of blood drawn across one eye. This statement implies that San'doro is indeed bleeding, as the presence of blood indicates some form of injury or wound. The narrative provided in the premise describes a specific situation where San'doro is looking at Jon while wearing a hood, and the line of blood across his eye suggests that he might have been involved in some action or circumstances resulting in the injury. The details provided about the line of blood and the injury to the eye affirm the hypothesis that San'doro is bleeding. Furthermore, the fact that the blood is described as being drawn \\"across one eye\\" gives us more information about the location and severity of the injury. From this description, it can be concluded that the bleeding is likely not a minor scratch or abrasion, but rather a more significant wound that has caused blood to flow down across the eye. This further supports the hypothesis that San'doro is indeed bleeding. In summary, the hypothesis that San'doro is bleeding is indeed entailed by the premise provided.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the family whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine? , can you please find it?   The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

Movie title: Dead Poets Society Context: New England, the late 1950s. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a lonely and painfully shy teenager, who is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there. This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him. But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyer.During the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the math teacher who states that \\"all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow\\". In stark contrast to these orthodox teaching methods, the guys see a different side of the school when they attend English class taught by the newly arrived (and liberal-minded) Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), whom they met briefly during the orientation -- Keating tells his class he was also a student at Welton (\\"Helton\\" as the students...

What is the scenario that could best explain how the people got sick? Choices:  A). contact with environmental sources;  B). contact with an infected animal;  C). contact with a contaminated object;  D). contact with an infected person;","output":"D). Contact with an infected person Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness that is caused by the influenza virus. It is primarily spread through the respiratory droplets from the coughs and sneezes of infected individuals. Considering the scenario of ten people becoming sick with the flu after attending a school dance, the most plausible explanation is that they had contact with an infected person (option D). During a school dance, attendees are usually in close proximity to one another, engaging in conversations and social interactions, which makes it easier for pathogens to spread. In this case, it is highly likely that one or more individuals were already infected with the influenza virus, but were either not showing symptoms yet or were experiencing mild symptoms that did not deter them from going to the event. Asymptomatic individuals can still spread the virus to others unknowingly. As these infected individuals mingled, coughed, or sneezed during the dance, they would have released respiratory droplets containing the virus particles into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by people nearby, causing them to become infected as well. The confined space, increased social interaction, and high level of people sharing the space could facilitate a faster spread of the virus. To further review the other choices: A). Contact with environmental sources: Although it is possible for the flu to spread through environmental sources, such as air conditioning systems, it is less likely in this scenario because person-to-person contact is the primary mode of transmission. Additionally, the fact that only ten individuals fell ill, rather than a larger number of attendees, suggests that the cases are more likely due to close contact with an infected person rather than an environmental source. B). Contact with an infected animal: Influenza can be transmitted between animals and humans; however, it is highly improbable that an infected animal was present at a school dance, making this option implausible in this context. C). Contact with a contaminated object: While it is true that the influenza virus can survive on various surfaces for a limited amount of time and can potentially cause infection if a person touches the contaminated object and then touches their face, it is less likely compared to direct contact with an infected person. The fact that all ten individuals fell ill after attending the same event further strengthens the argument that they were infected by an ill person during the event rather than independent contact with contaminated objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\"   means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England. Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown.

The first premise describes a scenario where women, wearing red shirts, are engaged in an activity – singing. The second statement, however, indicates that the singers are, in fact, men who wear black shirts. Based on the information provided, these two statements hold contrasting ideas. In the first statement, we are given that the singers in question are women with red shirts. Nonetheless, the second statement contradicts this claim, specifying that the singers are not women but men wearing black shirts. To determine whether or not the initial premise is true, we must examine any possible scenarios where both statements might be concurrently valid. For instance, it could be the case that there are two separate groups of singers – one group of women wearing red shirts and another group of men wearing black shirts. In this situation, although the singers described in the two statements are different, both premises may hold true. However, without adequate context, it is impossible to assess if such a scenario exists. Based on the information provided, we only know that “the singers are men wearing black shirts.” In conclusion, considering the details given, the premise \\"The women are wearing red shirts and singing\\" cannot be confirmed as true. The only information available explicitly states that the singers are men wearing black shirts, which directly contradicts the first premise. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if both premises can coexist truthfully.

The Stooges are artists (Moe is a sculptor, Larry is a music composer, and Curly is a painter) living in Paris. When the landlord comes after the overdue rent, the boys skip out and wind up accidentally joining the French Foreign Legion that they confuse with the American Legion. Posted to the desert, their assignment is to guard Captain Gorgonzola from the natives. When the captain is kidnapped, the boys are given a chance to bring him back alive. The Stooges make their way to the town where the captain was taken, all disguised as Santa Claus (complete with a sleigh and a reindeer). Despite the disguise not working, they are able to quickly knock out a guard who confronted them and make their way further into town. Ultimately, they find their captain held by a sheik trying to offer him expensive jewelry and a harem of beautiful women in exchange for the Legion's ammunition. The trio are forced to disguise themselves again as part of the harem and use an opportunity during a dance to render the sheik and his head bodyguard unconscious. The four then escape, but end up coming across a lion's den. Before the lion could eat them, Curly is able to placate it into drawing them on a wagon back to their camp. Answer:","output":"The stooges were guarding Captain Gorgonzola for the French Foreign Legion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ballantine Books is a major book publisher located in the United States, founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine. It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company).  - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.  - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\".  - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915  May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey.  - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy .  - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002.  - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion.  - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world.  As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC.  - Alice Borchardt (née Alice Allen O'Brien; October 6, 1939  July 24, 2007) was a writer of historical fiction, fantasy, horror. She shared a childhood of storytelling in New Orleans with her sister, the novelist Anne Rice, who was two years younger.

It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to meet with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees some bullies mugging a homeless man. After attempting to defend the man, Billy himself receives a black eye. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, calling him \\"The Captain\\". Billy tells him that he always tries to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only thing of value he has â a subway token. At the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfasts, and tells him he wants to write a story to bring his plight, and those in his same situation, to public light. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering outside the diner. He claps his hands together, blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls.

Answer: Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia . Question: when can you use a defibulator The answer is:","output":"Yes, defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. You can use a defibrillator when someone is experiencing any of these life-threatening heart conditions. A defibrillator works by delivering an electric shock to the heart in an attempt to restore its normal rhythm. It is essential to use a defibrillator as soon as possible in these situations, as the chances of survival decrease with each passing minute. Ideally, defibrillation should be performed within three to five minutes of the onset of the cardiac event. Defibrillators can be found in a variety of settings, such as in emergency medical facilities, public places (like airports, malls, and stadiums), and in some cases, even in private homes. Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) are designed to be user-friendly and can be used by people with minimal training in CPR and AED use. Before using a defibrillator, make sure to call for emergency medical assistance (like 911 or your local emergency number), and start CPR. When a defibrillator is available, follow the device's voice prompts and visual instructions to ensure proper use. The defibrillator will analyze the person's heart rhythm and will only deliver a shock if it is deemed necessary. Continue administering CPR after the shock has been delivered, until emergency medical help arrives or the person begins to regain consciousness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My name is Lin Hui. I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties  did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Painting keys can be both a fun and functional project. The process can brighten up an old or plain key, as well as help differentiate keys from one another. In order to accomplish this task effectively, the following steps should be taken. 1. Gather Your Supplies: To start off, you will need several supplies. This includes the keys you wish to paint, acrylic paints, or nail polish in the colors of your choosing, clear acrylic sealer or clear nail top coat for a finish, a paintbrush if you're using acrylic paints, a piece of old cloth or paper towel for cleaning, and a disposable plate or palette for paint. 2. Prepare Your Workspace: Lay out some newspaper or an old tablecloth to protect your workspace. This will help safeguard your surface from any paint spills. 3. Clean The Keys: Before painting, it's crucial to clean the key properly to make sure the paint will stick. This can be done with mild soap and warm water or with rubbing alcohol. Make sure to dry the keys thoroughly before you paint them. 4. Apply the Paint: Start painting your keys with the colors of your choice. If you're using acrylic paint, you might need several layers to achieve a solid color. Once you finish one side and its edges, allow the key to dry completely before flipping to the other side to avoid smudging the paint. 5. Add Patterns or Designs: If you'd like, you can use a finer paintbrush to add small patterns or designs on your keys. From stripes, dots, small shapes to initials - make it creative and personal. 6. Sealing the Paint: Once the keys are fully dry and you're happy with the look, you have to seal the paint to make sure it lasts. You can use clear nail polish or clear acrylic sealer for this. Apply a generous layer on both sides of the key, ensuring all painted areas are covered. Allow it to dry completely. 7. Let it Dry: The last and most critical step is to let the keys dry thoroughly. This can take several hours or up to 24 hours depending on the amount of paint and sealer used. Ensure they are completely dry before using them to prevent the paint from peeling off. 8. Maintenance: Remember to take care of your painted keys. Excessive wear or dropping the keys can cause the paint to chip. If this happens, you can always touch up the key with more paint and sealer. Each step is designed to ensure that the paint adheres well to the keys and is sealed effectively to prevent it from fading or chipping too easily. Painting your keys can add a personal touch and help distinguish one key from another. Remember to have fun and get creative when painting your keys."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is President Obama's Carter moment nearing? \\"This is the worst,\\" a Democratic friend exclaimed over the phone on Tuesday, the first day back at work after the Memorial Day weekend. I knew without asking what he meant -- the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico that dominated television coverage and was into its second month with no quick solution in sight. No, I told him. It's not yet the worst. They haven't built a popular new television program around it -- yet. No one has created a new media franchise for himself out of it. There isn't a name for it that has become part of popular culture. I was thinking back to when another Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, found himself stymied in another seemingly endless ordeal. Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 officials and workers hostage for 444 days, while the United States was helpless to free them. Many of us recall the event by the name that became attached to it: \\"America Held Hostage.\\" That was the title ABC News slapped on its half-hour news update that aired each night, with Ted Koppel as anchor. The show later became the long-running program \\"Nightline.\\" This is when you know you are truly harpooned, when your problem has become someone else's meal ticket. As sinister as the jet stream of escaping oil and gas looks via the underwater camera in the gulf, Barack Obama has not yet moved into the category of the late-night patsy that Jimmy Carter became. The Iranians were more clever, or diabolical, in exploiting their hostages than the restrained BP executives or their enviro foes are in this situation. Obama keeps popping up in new settings, sounding as if he is in command, and he has refused to be confined to the White House as Carter was by the hostage crisis. His good-guy Coast Guard retired admiral has not melted under the pressure, and the BP execs we've seen on TV refuse to play cartoon capitalists, instead conveying the sense that they grieve over the accident. As a result, this saga, painful as it is, has not yet become the simple demonstration of monumental futility and incompetence that the hostage crisis became for Carter, who let his personal frustration become the nation's humiliation. When he finally mounted a rescue effort, and the helicopters crashed into each other in the desert before reaching the hostages, it was the final proof that he was cursed in anything he tried to do. That truly was the worst. Today we're not there -- yet. But we have seen this movie before, and we know how it ends politically. Somebody else shows up and says he can fix this. Or end it. Or make it come out right. This is why Democrats are right to be very nervous as this gulf incident drags on in its second month. We have endured about as much technical explanation of the rigors of deep-sea drilling as we can stand. The chart talks demonstrating that we had figured out where the hostages were being held didn't do Carter a lick of good when voters were aching to see the captives walk into their families' arms. Nothing is going to help Obama unless and until the engineers come up with a method for shutting down this gusher of pollution. He clearly couldn't prevent it, and he was slow in signaling its severity. But he owns it now, and until it is over, the man who aspired to be the next John Kennedy or maybe Franklin Roosevelt will have to hope he doesn't end up as Jimmy Carter. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text is about how President Obama's situation with the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico is being compared to President Carter's hostage crisis in Iran back in 1979. The most important parts of the text are: 1. President Obama is dealing with an oil leak crisis in the Gulf of Mexico that has been ongoing for two months. 2. The oil leak crisis has not yet reached the same level of negative impact on Obama's image as the hostage crisis did for President Carter. 3. Some people believe that President Obama's handling of the situation has been better than Carter's handling of the hostage crisis. 4. However, Democrats are concerned about the political impact of the crisis as it continues to go unresolved. 5. The text emphasizes that the situation could get worse for Obama if the oil leak is not stopped soon, potentially causing him to be seen as another Jimmy Carter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Maassamme lääkkeet ovat usein kalliimpia kuin vanhoissa Euroopan unionin jäsenmaissa. Tämä ero lääkkeiden hinnoissa johtuu monista eri tekijöistä, kuten maakohtaisista hinta- ja toimitussopimuksista, määräalennuksista, veroista sekä erilaisista terveydenhuollon järjestelmistä. Erot voivat olla merkittäviä ja johtaa siihen, että ihmiset joutuvat mahdollisesti maksamaan enemmän lääkkeistään meidän maassamme verrattuna vanhoihin Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioihin. Yksi syy korkeampaan lääkkeiden hintaan voi olla lääkevalmistajien ja maahantuojien pienemmät määräalennukset. Toisin kuin suurissa Euroopan maissa, pienemmissä maissa ei välttämättä ole yhtä paljon ostovoimaa, jolloin lääkeyhtiöt eivät tarjoa samalta kokoisia alennuksia kappalemäärän kasvaessa. Tämä voi johtaa suurempiin kustannuksiin lääkkeiden hankinnassa ja siten korkeampiin hintoihin kuluttajille. Lisäksi erilaiset verot ja maksut voivat lisätä lääkkeiden hintoja. Esimerkiksi arvonlisävero (ALV) voi vaihdella EU-maiden välillä, ja se voi vaikuttaa lääkkeiden lopulliseen hintaan. Joissakin maissa, kuten meidän maassamme, saattaa olla myös korkeampia erityisveroja lääkkeille tai maksuja lääkkeiden jaoksen seurantaan ja valvontaan. Terveydenhuollon järjestelmät vaikuttavat myös lääkkeiden hintaan. Maissamme saattaa olla muita malleja, kuten julkinen terveydenhuolto tai yksityisiin sairausvakuutuksiin perustuva järjestelmä. Erot näiden järjestelmien välillä johtavat usein siihen, että kuluttajat joutuvat maksamaan enemmän lääkkeistä, sillä meidän maassa voidaan mahdollisesti joutua kattamaan suurempi osa lääkekustannuksista itse. Saattaa olla, että joissakin Euroopan unionin jäsenmaissa maksut ovat alhaisemmat siksi, että yhteiskunta suuremmassa määrin kattaa lääkekulut. On tärkeää huomata, että tämä ongelma on monimutkainen ja vaikuttaa moniin eri osa-alueisiin, minkä vuoksi ratkaiseminen ei ole yksinkertaista. Yhteistyö kansainvälisen ja paikallisen tason toimijoiden kanssa voi auttaa löytämään kestäviä ratkaisuja lääkkeiden hintaeroihin ja varmistamaan, että ne ovat saatavilla kaikille sitä tarvitseville kohtuuhintaan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue?

Question: Staying in our apartment on the North Shore of Vancouver, we were tucked into a sleepy, suburban idyll where once off the busy highway, kids played ball games in the street and cats strolled around their own home territories without a care in the world. It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.)

John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a first hand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan \\"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\\". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages.  Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction. Question: What country did the Indian Massacre of 1622 take place in?

Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.

If \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\", can we conclude \\"Humans are looking.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"humans are looking\\" based on the provided statement, \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\" Let's break down this conclusion by considering the context and definitions of the words used in both statements. First, let us analyze the given statement: \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\" In this statement, we have three primary pieces of information: \\"group of kids,\\" \\"look,\\" and \\"out of a fence.\\" 1. \\"Group of kids\\": Kids are young human beings, usually below the age of 18. The statement mentions a group, meaning that there is more than one child involved. 2. \\"Look\\": To look is to direct one's eyes towards something or someone to see or influence what is there. In this context, the kids are presumably directing their attention and gaze towards something or someone. 3. \\"Out of a fence\\": This part of the statement indicates that there is a fence present as an obstacle or boundary, and the kids are looking beyond it. Now, let's examine the conclusion statement: \\"Humans are looking.\\" In this statement, we have two main components: \\"humans\\" and \\"looking.\\" 1. \\"Humans\\": Humans are the species Homo sapiens, which includes people of all ages, including adults and children. In the given statement, \\"a group of kids\\" would fall under the category of humans, as kids are young humans. 2. \\"Looking\\": As mentioned previously, looking involves directing one's eyes towards something or someone to see what is there. In the given statement, the action of looking is performed by the group of kids. By analyzing the information provided in both statements, we can connect the relevant components to draw the conclusion. Since the group of kids are young humans, their action of looking out of a fence can indeed be generalized to the conclusion that \\"humans are looking.\\" While the given statement specifically refers to a group of kids, the conclusion focuses on the broader category of humans (i.e., children and adults). Nonetheless, the conclusion is valid because the action of looking performed by the kids can be attributed to the wider human species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Qu'ran, which is considered to be the holy scripture of Islam, is believed to be the literal word of God as it was revealed to Muhammad by Jibril. This divine communication took place over a period of 23 years, beginning in 610 CE when Muhammad was 40 years old, until his death in 632 CE. The revelations were sent to guide and instruct Muhammad, who was then responsible for conveying the message to his followers and the entire world. The process of revelation commenced when Muhammad, who had a habit of retreating to a cave on Mount Hira for deep contemplation and meditation, was visited by the angel Jibril. According to Islamic tradition, during Muhammad's first encounter with Jibril, he was instructed to \\"Read!\\" or \\"Recite!\\" (the word \\"Iqra\\" in Arabic). This marks the beginning of the prophethood of Muhammad and the inception of the Qu'ran. The revelations that Muhammad received from Jibril were usually in the form of direct speech or inspired visions. Muhammad would memorize these revelations and, thereafter, recite them to his companions, who would also commit them to memory, as well as write them down on various materials such as parchment, bones, and leaves. Over time, the revelations were compiled into a single volume — the Qu'ran. As the intermediary between Allah and Muhammad, Jibril plays a critical role in the Islamic faith. Not only was he responsible for delivering the verses of the Qu'ran, but Jibril also provided guidance, explanations, and interpretations of the revelations to help Muslims deepen their understanding of the holy scripture. In Islamic tradition, Jibril is considered to be one of the four archangels and is highly revered as the \\"Angel of Revelation.\\" In summary, Muslims believe that the verses of the Qu'ran were given by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril. This process of divine revelation took place over 23 years, during which the messages were eventually compiled into the Qu'ran, the holy scripture of Islam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

News article: : A sensor for remote detection of formaldehyde (FA) fumes in the atmosphere has been developed, based on the redox reaction between FA and silver nitrate. The sensor is worn as a bracelet and the data acquired are transferred via a Blue-tooth channel to a smartphone. A dedicated software transforms the signal from a grey to a colour scale. The signal response has been assessed over low (20 to 120 ppb) as well as higher (1-15 ppm range) levels. The sensor has been applied to monitor potential FA fumes of some artwork in two locations: the Tate’s gallery in London, during the display of several pieces of Damien Hirst, as well as in the Summer Palace in Beijing. In the first case, one of Hirst’s main subjects is the setting-up of giant fish tanks filled by thousands of liters of FA, in which intact biological specimens are immersed, such as zebras, cows, calves, even sharks. The parallelepiped-shaped basins are then covered with a lid and fully sealed with silicon gums. It has been found that the tanks are surrounded by FA fumes, constantly exuded in the atmosphere (likely via the sealant), reaching levels of 5 ppm, one order of magnitude higher than the 0.5 ppm limit set up by legislation. In the Summer Palace too posters in display and wooden beam works have been found to release FA vapours. ||||| Damien Hirst knows there's nothing like a touch of mild peril to set the art world alight - and it seems that's exactly what the artist inadvertently produced at his 2012 Tate gallery retrospective.      A research paper in a Royal Society of Chemistry journal detailed in the Daily Mail, reportedly found that Hirst's preserved artworks \\"Away From The Flock\\" and \\"Mother And Child Divided\\", leaked potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde whilst displayed at Tate Modern gallery for five months in 2012. Atmospheric levels reportedly reached up to 5ppm (parts per million) - ten times over the advisory limit.      Damien Hirst has, in the past, hinted at his impish lust for using the dangerous chemical in his work, claiming his penchant for formaldehyde is driven by the fact that \\"it is dangerous and it burns your skin. If you breathe it in, it chokes you.\\"      A spokesman for the Tate gallery responded to the report: \\"Tate always puts the safety of its staff and visitors first, and we take all necessary precautions when installing and displaying our exhibitions. These works contained a very dilute formaldehyde solution that was contained within sealed tanks.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A sensor that detects formaldehyde (FA) fumes in the atmosphere has been developed and used to monitor artwork by Damien Hirst at the Tate’s gallery in London and the Summer Palace in Beijing.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent  tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little  _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Options: A should brush them with a special denture brush every few days B will take a very long time to adjust himself or herself to them C will experience unpleasant feelings at the beginning of fixing them D should use denture solution to soak them in his or her mouth Answer: C will experience unpleasant feelings at the beginning of fixing them Question:","output":"What can a person experience when they first start using dentures?

Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens.

Matthew was a great swimmer while Benjamin was not since  Options:  A). Matthew had owned a pool all of their life..  B). Benjamin had owned a pool all of their life..","output":"I'll continue the story with Option A, since it makes more sense: Matthew was a great swimmer while Benjamin was not, since Matthew had owned a pool all of their life. Having grown up with unlimited access to a pristine swimming pool, Matthew had spent countless hours splashing, diving, and perfecting his strokes. Over the years, this constant practice helped him develop an innate talent for swimming. Step 1: Establish the bond between Matthew and Benjamin. Growing up in the same neighborhood, Matthew and Benjamin had been best friends since they were toddlers. They loved playing together and never let their differences come in the way of their friendship. Even though Matthew was a much stronger swimmer, it never led to any jealousy or resentment between the two. Benjamin was comfortable in his own skin and had his own unique interests and talents. Step 2: Elaborate on Benjamin's interests and talents. Benjamin's true passion was music. He had an enviable collection of musical instruments and spent hours each day mastering the subtleties of various rhythms, melodies, and techniques. Though he could keep up with Matthew in pursuits like soccer or basketball, he never quite managed to match his friend's grace and fluidity in the water. Despite that, Benjamin never shied away from joining Matthew for a refreshing swim on a hot summer day. Step 3: Introduce a challenge for the characters to face together. One day, the local community center announced an upcoming charity event where participants could showcase their skills in a fortnight-long competition. Both Matthew and Benjamin knew they had to take part in the event. They decided to turn their talent and passion into something meaningful by raising money for a cause they both believed in – providing opportunities for underprivileged children. Matthew signed up for the swimming competition, while Benjamin eagerly registered for the musical talent show. Step 4: Describe how they prepare for the competition. In preparation for the big day, Matthew and Benjamin made full use of their respective home amenities. Matthew spent long hours in his pool, continuously refining his technique and building his stamina. Benjamin, on the other hand, rehearsed his heart out with his instruments and practiced a wide variety of genres to wow the audience. Even though they were both engrossed in their own schedules, they made it a point to come together each evening to share their progress and support each other's efforts, always offering words of encouragement and motivation. Step 5: Write about the competition day and the outcome. Finally, the day of the competition dawned. Matthew and Benjamin's families and friends gathered at the community center, buzzing with excitement and pride for their performances. Confident in their abilities, the two friends knew they had given their all in preparation. Matthew swam with unparalleled grace and speed, winning first place in the swimming competition. Benjamin, in turn, delivered a mesmerizing performance that captivated the audience, securing him the top spot in the musical talent show. Step 6: Conclude the story with their accomplishments and bond. Together, Matthew and Benjamin had not only showcased their talents and passions, but also managed to raise a significant sum for the charity they chose. Their bond only grew stronger as they realized the importance of supporting each other's abilities and aspirations, and that their friendship was the true driving force behind their success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She tells the manager her address — 1127 Walnut Avenue — and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. The duo soon learn from a postman that the home is at the top of a very long stairway. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow.

After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\").

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Hindi is the national language of which country? Answer: Hindi is the national language of India. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Indian constitution. India is a linguistically diverse country with more than 1,600 languages spoken across different regions. However, Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, serves as the lingua franca in several parts of the country. It is spoken by around 44% of the Indian population, making it the most widely spoken language in India. Additionally, Hindi is one of the two official languages of the Indian central government, the other being English. Question 2: Should Hindi be made the national language of India? Answer: The question of whether Hindi should be made the national language of India is subjective and depends on an individual's perspective. To provide a well-rounded answer, let's consider some arguments from both sides. Advantages of making Hindi the national language: 1. Enhanced communication: Having a single national language can improve communication and foster unity among people from different regions, creating a better sense of national identity. 2. Administrative efficiency: A single national language can simplify administrative tasks and make government functions more efficient, as it would reduce the need for translation and interpreters. 3. Ease of learning: Many Indian languages trace their roots to Sanskrit, which is closely related to Hindi. Hence, speakers of other Indian languages could potentially find it easier to learn Hindi compared to, say, English or other languages. Disadvantages of making Hindi the national language: 1. Linguistic diversity: India boasts a rich linguistic diversity, with each language having its unique cultural significance. Making Hindi the sole national language could marginalize other languages and promote a sense of linguistic superiority, which might lead to regional tensions. 2. Endangering minority languages: The promotion of Hindi as the sole national language may lead to a decline in the use of regional and minority languages, weakening their cultural significance and potentially leading to their extinction. 3. Economic considerations: English is also an official language in India, and many industries rely on it for their international dealings. Shifting to Hindi as the primary language could create challenges in trade and commerce, especially in the international context. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? Answer: No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 seeks information about the national language of a given country, which in this case is India, and has a definite answer – Hindi. Meanwhile, question 2 asks for an opinion on whether Hindi should be made the national language of India. This question invites a debate and subjective viewpoints, weighing the pros and cons of such a decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia.  - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada.

Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south.  - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces  New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia  and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km.  - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist).  - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.  - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Learn about the behaviors of autistic individuals. Understand the importance of routine. Recognize the power of special interests. Get to know this person's strengths, differences, and challenges. Rid yourself of stereotypes about autistic individuals.\\"","output":"Title: Understanding and Supporting Autistic Individuals: Emotional, Social, and Behavioral Aspects Introduction Autism, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and behavior, affects millions of people worldwide. As awareness and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder grow, it is imperative to recognize the unique emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face. By having a comprehensive understanding of their behaviors, routine, and special interests, we can promote empathy, support their strengths, and break down stereotypes. 1. Recognizing the emotional challenges autistic people face Autistic individuals often have different ways of experiencing and expressing emotions, which may lead to misunderstandings with others. They may struggle with emotional regulation, making it difficult to manage strong feelings such as anxiety or frustration. It is essential to acknowledge emotional challenges that autistic people face, and provide them with a supportive environment that promotes healthy emotional growth. 2. Learning about the social challenges Autism affects how individuals interact with others. It may also cause differences in understanding body language, facial expressions, and social cues. Autistic people might find it challenging to maintain eye contact or engage in conversations, which may lead to isolation and feelings of loneliness. By learning about these social challenges, we can create more inclusive spaces that accommodate the social needs of autistic individuals. 3. Understanding the behaviors of autistic individuals Autistic people may engage in behaviors such as stimming (self-stimulatory behavior), echolalia (repeating sounds or words), or intense focus on specific interests. These behaviors often help autistic individuals cope with stress or sensory input and enable them to express themselves. Recognizing the purpose behind these behaviors can help us support autistic individuals in managing their needs and create a positive environment. 4. Acknowledging the importance of routine Routine and predictability are crucial for many autistic people. Routines provide a sense of security and structure, making it easier to deal with unfamiliar or overwhelming situations. Disruptions in routine can cause anxiety and distress, so it is essential to be mindful of their routines and support them in maintaining consistency. 5. Embracing the power of special interests Many autistic individuals develop strong interests, known as special interests, which often become an essential part of their identity. These interests can be therapeutic, providing an avenue for connection, relaxation, and self-expression. By recognizing the power of special interests, we can better understand the passions and talents of autistic people and help them channel their interests into meaningful activities. 6. Appreciating individual strengths, differences, and challenges Autism is a highly varied and individualized condition, with each individual having their unique set of strengths, differences, and challenges. It is crucial to respect and appreciate the uniqueness of autistic individuals, as understanding their distinct perspectives and abilities can help us provide the right support tailored to their needs. 7. Abandoning stereotypes about autistic individuals Stereotypes about autism - such as lack of empathy or intelligence - are not only inaccurate but harmful. Dispelling these stereotypes and embracing the diversity within the autism community help create a more inclusive society where autistic individuals can thrive. Conclusion As we continue to learn about autism and promote acceptance, it is crucial to recognize the emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face, understand their behaviors, and appreciate the importance of routine and special interests. With empathy, respect, and support, we can empower autistic individuals to live fulfilling lives while embracing their unique strengths and breaking down stereotypes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Eric John Wilson ( born February 21 , 1970 ) , is the former bass player for Sublime ( 1988 -- 1996 ) and also bassist for Long Beach Dub Allstars ( 1997 -- 2002 ) . He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer .  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002.  - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Answer the following question: Question: what is only constitutional leadership position in house of representatives I found the following answer on Google: The House has several exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials, and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, that is not the correct answer to your question. The information you found on Google refers to the powers of the House of Representatives as a whole, not the constitutional leadership position within the House.  The correct answer to your question is the Speaker of the House. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the only constitutional leadership position mentioned specifically within the U.S. Constitution. According to Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution, \\"The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker and other Officers.\\" The Speaker acts as the presiding officer and is responsible for overseeing the proceedings in the House, including managing debates and recognizing members to speak. The Speaker of the House of Representatives plays a crucial role in conducting the legislative business of the House. Some key responsibilities of the Speaker include: 1. Presiding over meetings and sessions of the House and maintaining order during debates. 2. Deciding on procedural matters and referring bills and resolutions to appropriate committees, which ultimately influences the legislative process. 3. Managing the legislative calendar by scheduling the consideration of bills and resolutions. 4. Representing the House in its relations with the Senate, the President, and other branches of government. 5. Overseeing various House administrative offices, such as the Clerk of the House, the Sergeant at Arms, and the Chief Administrative Officer. Additionally, in the line of presidential succession, the Speaker of the House stands second in line after the Vice President. This means that if both the President and Vice President are unable to serve, the Speaker of the House would be next in line to assume the presidency. It is important to note that a Speaker is elected at the beginning of each new Congress, typically representing the majority party within the House of Representatives."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old friend Steve's new wife, but Betty never seemed to have anything to say. While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping  . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of... Question: What did Sara think of Betty when talking with her? Options: A: Betty was talkative. B: Betty was an interrupter. C: Betty did not take her turn. D: Betty paid no attention to Sara.

В частности, согласно научным прогнозам и исследованиям, глобальная средняя температура на Земле возрастет в пределах от 1,4 до 5,8 градусов Цельсия. Такой рост температуры приведет к множеству негативных проявлений и экологических катастроф. Во-первых, ускорится таяние полярных льдов и ледников, что спровоцирует значительный рост уровня мирового океана. В результате, некоторые прибрежные города и населенные пункты могут быть затоплены. Во-вторых, изменение климата повлияет на погодные условия, сельское хозяйство и процессы, происходящие в экосистемах. Мы можем столкнуться с более частыми и интенсивными погодными явлениями, такими как ураганы, сильные дожди и засухи.

Рост температуры способствует размножению вредных насекомых-переносчиков инфекционных заболеваний, а также создает условия для распространения патогенных микроорганизмов.

As the cornerstone to a successful project, the foundation needed to be carefully planned, ensuring it would adequately support the weight of the proposed building, balancing both aesthetic appeal and structural practicality.  Furthermore, they knew that their choice of foundation would profoundly impact the structure's ability to withstand various environmental factors, such as seismic activity and soil erosion. Soil tests were conducted, as understanding the nature of the site's ground composition is crucial for determining the type of foundation best suited for the building. Different kinds of foundations such as shallow or deep were considered, each with its own benefits and limitations. Shallow foundations are often chosen for sites with hard soil, and when the building’s load does not necessitate deep penetration. On the contrary, deep foundations can be chosen in case the top soil layer is not strong enough to sustain the load of the building. As they worked tirelessly, their minds raced with intricate calculations, each knowing their professional reputation, and more importantly, the safety of those who would work, live, or simply spend time in the completed building hung in the balance. Yet, the responsibility didn't overwhelm them; instead, it motivated them to strive for excellence. Each day on the site brought them one step closer to seeing the building rise from its carefully designed foundation - a testament to their painstaking work, expertise, and commitment to quality and safety. Indeed, the process of laying the foundation on a building site is much more than just a physical act; it is a science that requires meticulous planning and execution, and a thorough understanding of the relationship between the building, its foundation, and the site on which it is built.

Rayo could not handle the partnership at the Nou Camp with all three goals coming from the pair, Villa opening the scoring and Messi scoring twice before Raul Tamudo grabbed a consolation. Victory helped Barcelona restore their 13-point lead over Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and Roura felt moved to categorically dismiss reports of bad feeling between the two. \\"This issue of a conflict I have heard many times - it is absurd,\\" said Roura, who is deputizing for Tito Vilanova as he continues to recover from cancer surgery in New York. \\"Currently the relationship between the two is just like it was a few months ago. I mean, very good.\\" Villa has enjoyed a fruitful week, his goal last night coming days after he scored against AC Milan as Barcelona made an astonishing comeback to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Roura continued: \\"I've always said that David is a very important man for us. It's a great joy for us to see him score because he brings a lot to the team. He has been a very important player this week and helped us a lot Could Neymar turn down Spain for Chelsea?

For us it is a great joy and we are pleased that they are so comfortable together. For the team there is no doubt that having players of this level is very important. Their quality is unquestionable.\\" And on Messi he added: \\"Life is a lot easier when you have Lionel Messi. You have to enjoy it on a daily basis when you have the best player in the world on your team.\\" Despite Barca's apparently unassailable position at the top of the league, Roura refused to look too far ahead. \\"We are in a very good situation, but you cannot say anything. Every game is important and we are closer, but still there is nothing gained. After the break we have to travel to Celta Vigo which will not be easy. Step by step.\\" The only downside for the Catalan club was a hamstring injury suffered by Adriano which will see him sidelined for four to six weeks.

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

You can also add decorative touches to revamp your shoes and take them for a test walk to ensure their comfort and sturdiness! In this article, we will provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you waterproof, personalize, and properly test your shoes. Step 1: Choose the Right Sealant Spray Before you begin the process, it is important to choose the appropriate sealant spray for your shoes. There are different types of spray available, such as silicone-based or acrylic-based. Consider the materials of your shoes and pick a suitable waterproof spray that works well with those materials. You can find sealant sprays in most shoe stores or online markets. Step 2: Prepare Your Shoes To ensure the best results, make sure to thoroughly clean your shoes before applying the sealant spray. This allows the spray to adhere better to the material. Remove any dirt or dust particles using a cloth, and allow the shoes to dry completely before moving on to the next step. Step 3: Apply the Sealant Spray Once your shoes are clean and dry, you can apply the sealant spray. Follow the instructions provided on the spray bottle and evenly coat the entire shoe surface. It is important to apply the spray in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling any harmful fumes. Allow the sealant to dry for the recommended time provided by the manufacturer. This will ensure that the sealant fully bonds to the shoe materials, providing reliable waterproofing. Step 4: Add Decorative Touches Now that your shoes are waterproof, you can move on to the fun part – adding decorative touches! There are endless ways to personalize your shoes, so use your creativity and imagination to make them uniquely yours. You can use fabric paint, stitching or embroidery techniques, or even sew on patches or appliqués. Make sure that the decorations you add do not compromise the waterproofing of your shoes. Step 5: Take Your Shoes for a Test Walk Once your shoes are dry and all your decorations are securely in place, it's time to take them for a test walk. This will ensure that your shoes are comfortable, and the sealant and decorations are properly set in place. It's also a great opportunity to show off your new and improved shoes! Walk around your neighborhood or go for a short hike to test how your shoes hold up in different environments. Check for any discomfort or signs of wear that need addressing. Conclusion Waterproofing your shoes with a sealant spray not only adds a protective layer to your footwear but can also be an excellent opportunity to personalize them with decorative touches. Following this step-by-step guide, you'll be able to turn heads with your unique, waterproof shoes. So, gear up and confidently step into any terrain without worrying about your shoes getting wet or damaged. Happy walking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874  July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.  - The Canadian federal election of 1940 was the 19th general election in Canadian history . It was held March 26 , 1940 , to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 19th Parliament of Canada . Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal Party was re-elected to their second consecutive majority government . The election was overshadowed by the Second World War , which caused many Canadians to rally around the government . In response to this , the Conservative Party of Robert Manion ran on a platform advocating the creation of an all - party national unity government and ran under the name \`\` National Government '' in this election . Though Manion was personally opposed to conscription , the Liberals faced intense pressure in Quebec on the question and promised not to institute the measure . This promise was to haunt the Liberals as they faced increasing pressure from the military and especially from English Canada to bring in the measure . To release him from his 1940 promise , King called a plebiscite in 1942 on the question . See also Conscription Crisis of 1944 . It was the most successful election for the Liberal Party in its history , in which it captured 73 % of seats in the House of Commons . Social Credit ran jointly with the New Democracy movement of William Duncan Herridge . Some candidates of the Conservative and Social Credit parties insisted on running under the traditional names , however . The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) gained its first seat east of Manitoba , with the election of Clarence Gillis from Cape Breton Island . This election was the last one for its ailing leader , J.S. Woodsworth . Voter turn - out : 69.9 %  - William Lyon Mackenzie (March 12, 1795  August 28, 1861) was a Scottish-Canadian-American journalist and politician.

Write some highlights for the following article: Raging clashes between police and protesters in Egypt on Saturday left two people dead and 750 injured, the Health Ministry reported, prompting a call from a prominent grass-roots group for citizens to resist the military-led government. The April 6 Movement, which figured prominently in the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak this year, issued a statement urging its members to descend on Cairo's Tahrir Square \\"immediately because resistance is the only solution.\\" \\"Down with military rule,\\" the movement said. The fighting erupted earlier in the day when police worked to clear the area of people who remained in the square after Friday's massive protests in Tahrir. Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out Friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight. As evening came Saturday, police blanketed the square and fired tear gas. The security forces soon withdrew and stationed themselves at the Interior Ministry. Warning shots were heard throughout the day. Thousands of protesters remained at the scene. They chanted against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which rules Egypt, and Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the council who is effectively the interim ruler of Egypt. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and torched a police van. Scuffles broke out on side streets and clouds of smoke rose from burned tires, witnesses said. Clashes between protesters and police also reportedly broke out in the cities of Suez and Alexandria. Two people died after being shot -- one in Cairo, one in Alexandria -- said Adel al-Dawi, a spokesman for the Health Ministry. State media reported that 750 people were injured, citing the Health Ministry. The Interior Ministry also said 20 police officers have been injured and eight people have been arrested. \\"We sent hundreds of Central Security Police Forces and forced out the remaining several hundred protesters who refused to go home. We arrested four thieves and thugs who acted aggressively and beefed up security in and around square overnight,\\" Interior spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said earlier Saturday. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent clashes and warned they could have a dangerous impact on Egypt, state media said. The Friday throng, dominated by Islamist parties but including secular protesters as well, turned out ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28. Mahmoud said the \\"Islamists and revolutionaries had left as they promised not to have a sit-in.\\" But stragglers remained, and he said many of the people who stayed in the square were families of those injured during the upheaval earlier this year that led to Mubarak's departure and the ushering in of the supreme council as interim rulers. Yousri Hamad, the official spokesman of the Al Noor Salafi Muslim political party, said he thinks that the violence could affect election plans. \\"The protesters are a bunch of kids that attacked the security forces which is a red line and could delay elections,\\" Hamad said. The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers. But protesters were upset Friday about proposed principles for the constitution, in which the military's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state. The outpouring reflected the power of Islamist forces in Egypt, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. A leader of that group called for restraint in the wake of Saturday's clashes, state media reported. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. At least 32 people, including two police officers, were injured. They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Protests also stretched to the United States on Saturday, where demonstrators gathered in the nation's capital in opposition to military rule in Egypt. Protester Amin Mahmoud, a member of a group called the \\"Egyptian Organization for Change USA,\\" said Egypt's military \\"has been taking civilians before military courts, and we are against that. \\"They are torturing a lot of young revolutionaries, accusing them of being traitors, and that is not true,\\" he said. CNN's Alexander Hunter contributed to this report.","output":"There were very big fights between the police and protesters in Egypt.

A group called the April 6 Movement asked people to stand against the government.

The protesters were not happy with the military government because they want more control in Egypt. They also didn't like the idea of the military's budget being secret. Many people think this fighting could make the upcoming elections difficult. The government wants to give power to the people but it is taking a long time and people are getting impatient.

Dark clouds started rolling in, signaling an approaching storm. The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of rain, and the first droplets began hitting the ground as the girls hesitated.  Should they continue or should they retreat? Lisa, the older and more confident of the two, decided that they wouldn't let a bit of rain dampen their spirits. Maddie, her younger sister, carried their brightly colored rainbow kite with both excitement and trepidation. As they approached the large expanse of the park, they noticed that other people had left, seeking shelter from the storm. This only excited them further as now they would have the whole space to themselves. They sprinted to the center of the park, where the sturdiest trees stood, seeking protection from the wind and the rain. Before they could unravel the kite, a loud clap of thunder shook the air, making both girls startle and catch their breath. This was turning into a more significant storm than they had anticipated. Lisa and Maddie exchanged worried glances, but neither wanted to be the first to give up. Ignoring their nagging doubts, Lisa unraveled the kite, as Maddie held onto it tightly. With a final nod of assurance, they began to run together, trying to catch the swift gusts of wind that the storm brought. The kite soared into the air, dancing wildly against the dark clouds, and the rain started falling more heavily. The girls, soaked to the bone, laughed with glee and surprise at their defiance of the weather. They continued maneuvering the kite as best as they could, battling the storm like it was an exhilarating adventure. The wind howled, tugging the kite vigorously as the sisters tried hard not to lose control. Just as the girls were getting the hang of the powerful gusts and guiding their kite smoothly, a deafening boom of thunder cracked the sky, illuminating their surroundings with bright, blinding light. Seconds later, a bolt of lightning struck close to their location, making both of them jump back frightfully. Realization finally hit them that perhaps they were out of their depth. The sisters looked fearfully at one another, soaked and shivering, their clothes sticking to their bodies. What had begun as a lighthearted attempt at thrill-seeking had now turned into a dangerous pursuit, and they knew it was time to seek shelter. They relinquished their grip on the kite, watching it carried away by the fierce wind. Lisa held Maddie's hand tightly as they hurried back from where they had come, bounding over puddles and navigating slippery paths. The euphoria of earlier was replaced by pounding hearts and anxious breaths, as they felt the urgency of finding safety. Upon reaching home, battered by the storm but relieved to be in the warm shelter, they huddled under their mother's embrace. As their shivering faded away and the rain outside softened to a gentle patter, the sisters recounted their adventure to their parents, describing the highs and lows they encountered in the park. Their parents, torn between being glad the girls had bonded in such a way and worried about their safety, reminded them of the importance of recognizing and respecting nature's force. Despite their understanding and somewhat sheepish agreement, the girls couldn't help but admit privately to one another that they would always cherish that wild day when they had chased the storm and dared to fly a kite against the odds."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is Jim Block going to watch?  Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Truth can often be stranger than fiction as a story that could have come straight out of The Game of Thrones illustrates. 580 years ago today, 21 February 1437, James I of Scotland was brutally murdered by Sir Robert Graham, an acolyte of the Earl of Atholl, in a bloody struggle for the Scottish throne. In the aftermath the Queen, Joan Beaufort, who survived the attack, wreaked a terrifying retribution upon the traitors in one of the most brutal, savage and grisly acts of revenge Scotland had seen.            James and his wife Joan were both buried in Perth’s ‘Charterhouse’, a monastery of Carthusian monks which he had commissioned as a showcase and future mausoleum for his dynasty. A century later, the sister of Henry VIII of England, Margaret Tudor, consort of King James IV of Scotland, was also buried here.            Today, 21 February 2017, experts in archaeology, Scottish history and 3d visualisation from the University of Stirling, The University of the Highlands and Islands and the School of Simulation and Visualisation at The Glasgow School of Art announced a joint venture that seeks to locate the Charterhouse site – and the tombs within it – and recreate it as a virtual museum for the 21st century.            Project lead Professor Richard Oram, Dean of Arts and Humanities at the University of Stirling, said: “Perth’s Charterhouse was unique in Scotland. James built it to be the spiritual focus of his dynasty and poured huge sums of money into it to create a splendid setting for his tomb. Medieval descriptions speak of the magnificence of the church, but nothing of it remains above ground to be seen today – the whole monastery was plundered and demolished at the Reformation.            “Working with our archaeology colleagues and the wider community in Perth, we aim to locate the Charterhouse buildings and recover as much of their plan as possible to allow us to ‘build’ a virtual reconstruction of the complex and restore the jewel in the crown of the city’s lost medieval heritage. Unearthing this almost forgotten building will transform understanding of Perth’s place in James I’s ambitions: locating the royal tombs within the church would be the icing on the cake.”            The Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands has an exceptional reputation for innovation in research, public history and the provision of higher education. One of the university’s thirteen partner colleges is the vibrant campus at Perth.            Dr Lucy Dean, the newest member of the Centre for History team at the University of the Highlands and Islands and co-investigator on the project, adds: “In the early fifteenth century, Perth was at the geographical heart of the country, a few miles from the inaugural site of Scottish kings, and the setting for parliaments, exchequers, church courts, royal ceremonial, and a bustling hub for trade in the later fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The murder of James I was a pivotal moment that saw a rapid end to Perth’s status.            The Charterhouse Project will allow the local, national and world communities the opportunity to discover and re-discover the fascinating history of this lost capital through innovative research and delivery methods. Moreover, both the research and the products it will produce will offer innovative educational tools and involvement for all levels from primary to high education and beyond.”            The Glasgow School of Art’s School of Simulation and Visualisation is in the forefront of 3D visualisation and virtual reality in projects including the Scottish Ten (with Historic Environment Scotland) and the Definitive Human Anatomy (with Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and NES). Project lead at SimVis, Paul Wilson, said: “The Charterhouse Project offers the opportunity to use state of the art 3D visualisation techniques to bring this exciting period of history to life, and to create a vivid sensory experience of James I’s burial place in 360 / 3D Super High definition which would be accessible across a range of different platforms and devices.”            The public will have a chance to learn more about the project on Saturday 25 February 2017 through a digital presentation at Perth Museum and Gallery (10am – 12 noon). A walking tour of the city (12.30pm -2pm) will offer the opportunity to hear about King James I’s dreams to make Perth the capital of Scotland, how these were violently ended in 1437, and how archaeological and historical research are helping to tell the story.

Who was James I and why don't we know where he's buried?      James I of Scotland was a complex and colourful king.      He was a poet, a sportsman, a musician and a patron of architects.      He survived being kidnapped by pirates when he was just 12 years old - and the following 18 years he spent as a hostage to the Lancastrian kings of England.      In 1424, he made a triumphant return to Scotland and was crowned at Scone, but 13 years later he was brutally stabbed to death, his body dumped in the sewer below the Blackfriars monastery in Perth.      Young prince in danger      James Stewart was born in 1394, the third son of King Robert III and Annabella Drummond.      By the time he was eight years old, he was their only surviving son.      His brother Robert died in infancy and his other brother David, the Duke of Rothesay, died in suspicious circumstances at Falkland Castle while he was being detained by his uncle Robert, the Duke of Albany.      After David's death, James was the heir to the Scottish throne, but he was also an impediment to the royal line being transferred to the Albany Stewarts.      Fears grew for his safety and plans were made to send him to France.      In March 1406, he boarded a boat bound for France, but just days into the voyage, the vessel was intercepted in the English Channel by pirates who delivered him to Henry IV of England.      Eighteen years a hostage      On 4 April 1406, Robert III died and the 12-year-old James was now the uncrowned King of Scots. But he was imprisoned in England and his uncle, the Duke of Albany, became regent in Scotland.      James may have been a prisoner, but he was allowed to keep a small household and was treated well by Henry IV.      This lasted until 1413 when Henry IV died, his son Henry V became king, and James was transferred to the Tower of London with other Scottish prisoners.      It took another seven years before James' standing improved enough for him to be regarded more of a guest than a hostage - but it took a third change of monarch in England before James was finally allowed back to Scotland.      Henry V died in 1422, and the regency council for the infant Henry VI were eager to organise his release as soon as possible.      Despite opposition from the Albany Stewarts, it was arranged for 1424 when he arrived triumphantly in Edinburgh on Palm Sunday, accompanied by his newly-wed English wife, Joan Beaufort.      Coronation and assassination      James I was crowned King of Scotland at Scone on 21 May 1424.      Prominent members of the Albany Stewarts were found guilty of rebellion and executed, but a conspiracy against the King began to grow and he reigned for just 13 years before his death.      On 4 February 1437, the King and Queen were in their royal apartments at the Blackfriars monastery in Perth, when a group of about 30 people was let in by one of the conspirators against him.      James I was alerted and had enough time to hide in a sewer tunnel, but his exit was blocked and he was trapped and killed.      He died in a pool of his own blood, stabbed dozens of times.      The assassin, Sir Robert Graham, is said to have screamed after his death: \\"I have thus slayne and delivered yow of so crewel a tyrant, the grettest enemye that Scottes or Scotland might have.\\"      James I was buried within the grounds of Perth Charterhouse, but the priory was destroyed in the reformation a century after his death and now no-one is exactly sure where his grave is.      A stone monument at the corner of Perth's King Street and Hospital Street marks the fact he is buried somewhere in the area.      Discovering the murdered King's exact location would be a major historical find - and a coup for the city of Perth. ||||| A bid to locate the body of James I of Scotland has been launched in Perth — 580 years to the day after his brutal murder.      It has long been known than an elaborate tomb for the king was housed in the city’s Charterhouse monastery but the exact location has been lost in the mists of time.      Now academics from across Scotland have joined forces with Perth’s archaeology, heritage and cultural bodies to locate and virtually recreate the lost tombs and buildings from one of the most bloody chapters of local history.      Project lead Professor Richard Oram, dean of arts and humanities at the University of Stirling, said: “Perth’s Charterhouse was unique in Scotland.      “James built it to be the spiritual focus of his dynasty and poured huge sums of money into it to create a splendid setting for his tomb.      “Medieval descriptions speak of the magnificence of the church, but nothing of it remains above ground to be seen today – the whole monastery was plundered and demolished at the Reformation.      “Working with our archaeology colleagues and the wider community in Perth, we aim to locate the Charterhouse buildings and recover as much of their plan as possible to allow us to ‘build’ a virtual reconstruction of the complex and restore the jewel in the crown of the city’s lost medieval heritage.      “Unearthing this almost forgotten building will transform understanding of Perth’s place in James I’s ambitions — locating the royal tombs within the church would be the icing on the cake.”      A search of archives and the use of ground penetrating radar to locate the buildings will be followed by archaeological test pit digs.      The public will have a chance to learn more about the project on Saturday February 25 at a digital presentation at Perth Museum and Gallery from 10am to 12 noon.

Archaeologists and virtual reality artists want to digitally recreate the court of King James I of Scotland in Perth, around 40 miles (64 kilometres) from Edinburgh, and try to find the king's tomb buried beneath the modern-day city.      They are also looking for the remains of his queen, Joan Beaufort, and of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England and wife of James IV of Scotland, who was also buried there a century later.      The team has been inspired by the discovery of King Richard III of England beneath a car park in Leicester.      \\"It's like 'Game of Thrones' and 'Outlander' all rolled into one—except this story is real,\\" said Paul Wilson, who is leading the digital visualisation project at Glasgow School of Art (GSA).      James I was assassinated on February 21, 1437, by supporters of a rival claimant to the throne, an act which historians say brought an end to his ambition to make Perth the capital of Scotland.      \\"That day changed Scotland forever,\\" Wilson said.      The king's mausoleum lay at the heart of a Carthusian priory called the Charterhouse, which was modelled on the Grande Chartreuse in the French Alps.      The team is planning archaeological digs over the next two years to map out the Charterhouse boundaries and recover artefacts, which will then be used to create a virtual reality tour.

Does the term give mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the term \\"give\\" is used with different meanings due to the context in which they appear. In the first sentence, \\"Give thought to,\\" the term \\"give\\" is used to mean devoting or directing one's attention, time, or effort to something. In this context, to \\"give thought to\\" implies that one should consider or think carefully about the matter at hand. This meaning of \\"give\\" is more abstract and suggests a mental or emotional contribution rather than a tangible one. In the second sentence, \\"I gave two sons to the war,\\" the term \\"give\\" is used in a different sense, conveying the meaning of presenting or offering something as a gift or sacrifice. Here, the speaker is indicating that they have lost two of their sons who participated in a war, and as a result, the implication is that their sons were given away, or sacrificed, for the cause of the war. This context reflects a more concrete sense of giving, as it involves the offering of something (or someone) with a tangible existence, such as the sons in this case. In conclusion, although the term \\"give\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings due to the contextual differences.

Jacob Cook, 30, from Woodhall Spa, unwittingly spent four months chatting online with an undercover officer posing as a 13-year-old school girl. During the chats, Cook offered to talk the girl through \\"her first masturbation\\" and \\"take her virginity\\". He was jailed for three years at Lincoln Crown Court. Cook, a university graduate, believed he was chatting to a \\"bored\\" 13-year old called \\"Tiny Dancer\\" on the Kik app. Mark Watson, prosecuting, said Cook made sexually explicit suggestions to the girl after asking about her experiences of sex. The defendant told the girl he was a rugby coach, and referred to himself as a teacher in a bid to \\"gain a degree of trust from her\\", he added. \\"It is perfectly plain that he believed he was talking to a schoolgirl,\\" Mr Watson said. During a subsequent investigation, detectives discovered Cook had applied for clearance to work coaching children and his case became a priority. After his arrest, Lincolnshire Police found over 200 pornographic images of children, as well as photographs featuring bestiality on his mobile phone. Cook, of King Edward Road, Woodhall Spa, admitted attempting to incite a 13-year-old girl to engage in sexual activity between 1 December 2015 and 31 March 2016. He also admitted three charges of making a total of 230 indecent images of children and a further charge of possession of extreme pornographic images. In addition to his jail term, Cook was handed a seven-year sexual prevention order.

A: The answer is:","output":"Looking directly at the Sun, which is a celestial object, can cause blindness. The Sun is a vast and powerful source of light and energy, being the primary source of warmth and light for our planet Earth. It is an immense, continuously burning ball of gas, primarily consisting of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. It is located at the center of our Solar System, with all planets and celestial bodies revolving around it.  Observing the Sun with the naked eye, especially during its peak hours, can cause temporary or permanent damage to your eyesight, including blindness. The reason is that the Sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet rays (UV), which can harm the eye's delicate tissues, such as the retina or the lens. Looking directly at the Sun, even for a brief period, can induce a condition called solar retinopathy, which results from the excess intake of solar energy by the eye's retina. Solar retinopathy can lead to varying degrees of visual impairment, from temporary light sensitivity and afterimages to permanent blindness. Moreover, the pain receptors in the retina are usually absent, meaning that the damage caused may go unnoticed at first, and its symptoms are only identified later on. Solar eclipses are particularly dangerous in this regard. When an eclipse happens, the Moon partially or completely blocks the Sun's disk, leading people to believe that it's safe to stare directly at it. However, even during an eclipse, the Sun's edges emit potent UV rays, capable of leading to severe, irreversible eye damage. To prevent eye injury caused by direct solar observation, it is crucial to take the necessary precautions, such as using specialized viewers or filters, like solar eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out the harmful rays. Another safe option is the projection method, such as a pinhole projector, which allows you to indirectly watch the event without facing the risks associated with staring at the Sun. It is worth noting that using ordinary sunglasses, smoked glass, or other makeshift filters is dangerous, as they may not provide adequate protection. In conclusion, the celestial object that looking at directly can cause blindness is the Sun. Staring at the Sun without proper protection can have disastrous consequences on your eyes, such as temporary or permanent visual impairment, including solar retinopathy and blindness. To ensure your safety, always use appropriate protection, such as solar eclipse glasses or indirect viewing methods, when observing this powerful celestial body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why make us spend multiple time registering.  In the end, the games showed me up as some 8 yr old white kids.    The Hulk game and Iron man game were not even sync or calibrated.  Whats the point of waiting in line to training and no be able to do anything except crash into the mountain or not even move the hulk.  You should invest in a XBOX.  At least they know how to get those game working  The only good game was the laser black widow game.  Too bad you only had 1 of them and it also had the longest line.  What were you thinking?

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One potential question that could be asked from this paragraph is: How did the communication process between the President, Vice President, and military officials unfold during the critical moments of addressing the hijacked planes on September 11, and what challenges did they face in making and executing decisions in response to the rapidly evolving situation?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life. His family especially his wife did their best to tend and comfort him. By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough(  )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock. What was Edwards doing when he was struck by the lightning? A) Hiding from the rain under a tree. B) Driving a car. C) Taking a walk D) lying on the ground A:","output":"Edwards was hiding from the rain under a tree when he was struck by the lightning.

Article:Stefano Poborko, 52, suffered burns in the blast on a Tube train between King's Cross and Aldgate when a suicide bomber detonated a device in 2005. He applied in March 2015 to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) but is still waiting. The CICA said it deals with all applications \\"as quickly as possible\\". On the day of the tube attacks in 2005, Mr Poborka, who now lives in Newbridge, Caerphilly county, was running late for a work meeting, and suffered burns to his back, head and ear in the blast. He said a fellow passenger died in his arms before emergency services arrived. The attack, was one of four explosions targeting three tube trains and a bus and was the worst single terrorist attack on British soil and claimed the lives of 52 people, with 770 more injured. Mr Poborko's condition means he now uses a wheelchair and his fiancÃ©e Louise Britt is also his primary carer. Ten years after the attack, he applied for compensation from the CICA - a government body which compensates people who suffer physical or mental injuries arising from violent crime. But he is still awaiting a decision. Mr Poborko has criticised the length of time taken to determine his case - including delays caused by his medical records being misnamed on CICA's system. CICA said it deals with all applications \\"as quickly and sensitively as possible\\". Recent figures show in 2015-2016, CICA took an average of more than 11 months to reach a first decision on cases - slightly longer than in the previous year. CICA said the increase \\"reflects the changing nature of our caseload\\". Mr Poborko said he hoped to gain compensation as some \\"recognition\\" of what he has been through, and to improve his quality of life by enabling him to buy his home, instead of renting. \\"I want it sorted - it's ridiculous,\\" he said. \\"All I was doing was running late for work, and I got blown up. \\"I just want to get on with my life, with Louise, in our home.\\" Mr Poborko's solicitor, Glyn Maddocks, said although the compensation claim was outside the two-year limit stipulated, CICA had discretion to consider the case. \\"He's entitled to compensation - he was a victim of a crime which was the terrorist outrage on 7 July. \\"He witnessed it, the experiences that he had and what he saw on that day are horrific and life-changing, and he's entitled to receive compensation from the public body because of that.\\" A CICA spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, adding: \\"We express our sympathy to all victims of crime and are committed to resolving applications as quickly and sensitively as possible.\\" MS is a condition which affects the brain and/or spinal cord, and symptoms can include problems with vision, limb movement, sensation and balance. It is estimated there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK.

Read this article and answer this question The Azov campaigns demonstrated the significance of having a fleet and marked the beginning of Russia's becoming a maritime power. Russia's success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698-1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700.As Azov's harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog . On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \\"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns. The report also included the request to declare war on the Ottomans, as well as to repay some 300,000 tomans to the Russians, which the report asserted were owed to the Tsar \\"since the days of shah Safi\\" . What was founded during the same time as the Karlowitz Congress?","output":"During the same time as the Karlowitz Congress, Taganrog was founded.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  Now, I have a new situation: A scientist, John, has two containers of the same noble gas. John sends electricity through container A. Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown.  Answer this question please: Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B?

Ruth doesn't hear it and she dismisses it, claiming that his ears are ringing from years of loud music. Jonas' reaction to Simon's ailment is much different than Ruth's. Jonas believes Simon and, after doing some research, believes that what Simon is hearing is in fact a government experiment, which utilizes an ultrasonic auditory signal to control the minds of all who hear it. Simon, with some prodding from Ruth, goes to visit an ear doctor who informs him that his test results show Simon's hearing to be least 6,000 Hz higher than the average human. This convinces Jonas that his theory is correct, and the two of them embark on a journey to get to the bottom of the sound experiment and stop the noise.  Guess a valid title for it!

Just like when you play a game and get points, these are the points they use to go to this special college. 2. \\"Dell vs HP for mechanical engineering?\\" This question is asking which is better for studying mechanical engineering (it's like learning how stuff moves and works) - Dell or HP. They are both companies that make computers and sometimes people can't decide which one is best. These two questions are different because the first one is about getting into a special college with a specific score, and the second one is asking which computer is better for a certain type of learning.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime. Australian computer software designer Sarah Huang is seven months pregnant but still working full-time in her Bangkok office.

Title: Mother and Son Movie plot: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death.

Jake is one of the firms top brokers and the protégé of its managing director, Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). Zabel has become disillusioned with the industry and doesn't understand how he can be told a loss is a profit. He gives Jake a 1.5 million bonus and tells him to spend it and keep the economy going. Zabel also encourages Jake to marry Winnie and have a kid since he knows that growing old isn't for the weak in this business and that Jake needs her.Jake goes out to celebrate with his best friend and buys Winnie a diamond ring. He mentions that Winnie doesn't really support marriage, given the outcome of her parents divorce, but Jake knows that she loves him and he loves her.

Zabel doesn't come in to work so Jake goes and finds him walking his wife's dog in the park.... My question: When is Bretton James exposed ? Answer:","output":"Bretton James, a major antagonist in the movie \\"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,\\" is exposed towards the latter part of the film. James, played by Josh Brolin, is the head of a rival investment bank called Churchill Schwartz and is the person responsible for the collapse of Keller Zabel Investments, leading to Louis Zabel's suicide. This tragic event prompts Jake Moore to seek revenge against Bretton James. Jake first encounters Bretton James when he attends a lecture by Gordon Gekko and later meets with Gekko to discuss the possibility of working together to expose James. Gekko agrees to help Jake in exchange for help in rebuilding his relationship with his estranged daughter, Winnie. As Jake becomes more entrenched in Bretton James' world, he gathers information on James' illegal activities and takes a job at Churchill Schwartz to dig deeper into their operations. Meanwhile, with Gekko's help, Jake and Winnie reveal that Bretton James is involved in a massive embezzlement scheme connected to the collapse of Keller Zabel. This exposé occurs during a charity event, where Gekko and Jake use a two-way disguised radio system to feed information about James's illicit activities to the influential people attending the event. Once the truth about Bretton James' unethical and illegal activities is out, a chain of events takes place leading to Bretton James' downfall, with regulatory authorities taking action against him and his company. He is forced to step down as the head of Churchill Schwartz as public opinion turns against him, and his Wall Street career is effectively ruined. Overall, Bretton James is exposed towards the end of the movie, when Jake Moore and Gordon Gekko work together to bring him down by revealing his corrupt practices and involvement in the collapse of Keller Zabel Investments. This ultimately leads to justice for Louis Zabel and his company, as well as the reclaiming of integrity in the world of finance."},{"instruction":"Q:-  Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.

The isotope emits radiation: Emission of radiation is a nuclear process and not affected by oxygen or blood vessels. 4. The isotope decays: Decay is a nuclear process; its rate is not impacted by oxygen or blood vessels. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: Losing atomic particles is a result of nuclear decay, so it isn't affected by oxygen or blood vessels. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: Conversion into a different element is due to atomic particle loss, which is not affected by oxygen or blood vessels. 7.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 8.72 points, or 0.2%, to end at 5218.86. The S&P 500 gained 1.64 points, or 0.1%, to 2128.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 13.96 points, or 0.1%, to 18100.41. Upbeat corporate earnings reports lifted stocks. Hasbro Inc. HAS -3.28 % notched the biggest gain in the S&P 500, rising 6.3%, after the toy maker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue in its second quarter. Halliburton Co. HAL 2.80 % ’s shares advanced 1.8% after the oil-services company posted per-share earnings and revenue that beat expectations. “Anything with growth is getting bought in a very, very aggressive manner,” said Rick Fier, director of execution services at Conifer Securities. He added that the “geopolitics has really calmed down,” referring to a recent bout of market volatility brought on by the financial crisis in Greece. Shares of Morgan Stanley MS 0.10 % fell 0.4% after the bank reported lower earnings that still topped analyst expectations. Monday’s gains mark a return for major indexes to record or near-record territory. Receding fears about Greece’s financial situation and some stronger-than-expected earnings reports have bolstered shares in recent sessions. For the month, the Dow has added 2.7% and the S&P 500 has gained 3.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 4.65% in July, helped by a rise in Google Inc. GOOG -0.11 % and Netflix Inc. NFLX 1.77 % following strong quarterly reports last week. Shares of both companies gave back some of their recent gains Monday. Google Class A shares lost 1%, while Netflix stock fell 3.7%. The second-quarter earnings season will continue to gain steam in coming days. Investors have been bracing for one of the weakest quarterly earnings seasons in years, with corporate performance hampered by a strong dollar and a selloff in oil prices. Including results from 67 companies in the S&P 500, second-quarter earnings are on track to slip 3.2% from a year ago. That is better than the 4.5% decline forecast by analysts heading into the reporting season. “Last week, we had a combination of bank earnings and a celebration that Greece was in the rearview mirror” driving stock gains, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “This week, we get reports from a much broader swath of corporate America and that will give us a better handle on just how strong the second quarter was.” Elsewhere on Monday, a tumble in gold prices prompted a selloff in the shares of several mining firms. Shares of gold producer Newmont Mining Corp. tumbled 12%. The SPDR Metals & Mining ETF Index lost 2.4%. Materials firms in the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. Gold futures shed 2.2% to 1106.70 an ounce, their lowest level since March 2010. Crude-oil futures fell 1.5% to 50.15 a barrel. Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT -0.97 % rose 2% after the defense contractor agreed to buy Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. UTX -7.03 % for 9 billion. United Technologies shares fell 0.2%. European stocks advanced as Greek banks reopened after three weeks, fueling confidence that Greece has avoided an exit from the eurozone. The Athens Stock Exchange, which has been closed since June 29, remained shut. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5% and France’s CAC-40 added 0.35%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.372%, compared with 2.349% on Friday. Yields rise as prices fall. —Austen Hufford contributed to this article.

It weakens the insult, it lessens the tension in the situation, and it gets others on your side.  Consider using humor the next time someone puts you down.  You might find it appropriate to even exaggerate or extend the put down, which serves to further lessen the power of the insult. For example, if someone insulted you with the comment, “Your ears are so big,” you could offer a humorous response by saying, “Oh yes.  The better to hear you with, my dear” (a reference to Little Miss Riding Hood). Laughing at an insult can be a very powerful response. Laughter makes the insult seem insignificant, and it also communicates that you were not hurt by the insult.  Furthermore, it takes away the emotional power that the insulting person was hoping to gain from putting you down. Bullies are typically looking for a reaction or disagreement from you to fuel their desire to cause you pain.  Instead of giving the bully what she is looking for, give her the unexpected by agreeing with whatever she said to insult you.  Just say something like, “You are so right.  I couldn’t agree more,” and keep agreeing as she continues the insult. She will get bored of teasing you of you don't provide a reaction. The person launching the insult is probably seeking for you to engage negatively.  By walking away, you are essentially ignoring the person’s insult and the individual himself. Try to walk away the next time someone says something unkind. If you want, you can provide a brief comment as you walk away. For example, if your spouse were to say, “You are such a slob,” you response could be, “Okay,” and then walk away.

The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator, Dr. Jeremy Stone, investigates Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. In an isolated underground laboratory, the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor. In the event of a contamination breach, a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary, Major Bill Keane, designated by the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during crisis), is the only person able to deactivate the sequence, using his pass key and right thumbprint.

I'll provide a few examples: 1. What initial discoveries do the Wildfire team make about the microorganism, Andromeda?    Answer: The initial discovery of the Wildfire team regarding the Andromeda strain is that the microorganism is contained within a system of buckyballs, which is a technology more sophisticated than anything currently known. 2. Who is General George Mancheck, and what is his role in the movie?    Answer: In the movie, General George Mancheck is the head of the bio-defense department. His role is significant when the retrieval team dies from the disease released by the satellite. He activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a protocol that forms a team of five scientists to investigate a high-level bioterror threat. 3. Why are only a 60-year-old man and a colicky baby the only survivors of the Andromeda outbreak?    Answer: The details of why only a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby remain survivors of the Andromeda outbreak are not provided in this summary. It may suggest that the microorganisms had varied effects across different age groups and health conditions, but the actual reasons would become clear only after watching the movie or having a more complete summary. 4. Explain the relevance of Major Bill Keane and the Odd-Man Hypothesis in the context of the plot?    Answer: Major Bill Keane, as per the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which intimates that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during a crisis), is the only person who can deactivate an automatically initiated self-destruct sequence in the event of a contamination breach in the laboratory. His role, therefore, is crucial in case of an emergency. 5. What is the significance of the \\"Wildfire\\" team and how do they contribute to the progress of the story?    Answer: The \\"Wildfire\\" team, activated by General Mancheck, consists of five scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone. Their role is to investigate high-level bioterror threats. In the context of this movie, they explore the Andromeda outbreak, retrieve the satellite, and rescue the survivors. The analysis and actions of the Wildfire team drive the narrative of the story. 6. How does the satellite crash impact the town of Piedmont, Utah, and how does the government respond to the situation?    Answer: The satellite crash near Piedmont, Utah, leads to the release of a deadly microorganism codenamed Andromeda when the town's inhabitants open it. As a result, a team from the Army's bio-defense department is dispatched to retrieve the satellite, but they succumb to the disease. Owing to the unusual deaths and footage recorded by the retrieval team, \\"Wildfire\\" - a team of five scientists for high-level bioterror threats - is activated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Worst affected were the towns of Accumoli and Amatrice and the villages of Pescara del Tronto and Arquata del Tronto. The first confirmed deaths following the quake came in Amatrice, and by Thursday it was clear that many had been buried when the town collapsed. The town's mayor, Sergio Pirozzi, told the AP news agency: \\"Half the village has disappeared.\\" In Accumoli, a small mountain town, the first victims were a family of four who were found under the debris of a collapsed building. Mayor Stefano Petrucci told reporters: \\"We have a tragedy here. There are people under the ruins.\\" He said the town of just 700 residents swells to 2,000 in the summer months thanks to tourism, but that he feared for its future after the earthquake.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Athletics are very competitive these days at all levels, from school sports to the pros. Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet.  Now, I have a new situation: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements  begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race.  Answer this question please: Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background and situation, it is likely that sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase during the time leading up to the marathon. This increase can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the majority of the marathon participants are competitive athletes who are constantly seeking ways to improve their performance. The prevailing belief among many athletes and fitness enthusiasts is that amino acid supplements may provide an advantage in terms of enhancing endurance, muscle growth, and recovery. Although scientific studies have not consistently demonstrated a clear advantage of amino acid supplementation for athletes, consumer perceptions often drive purchasing behavior. Secondly, the increased advertising by the sporting goods store can also contribute to a boost in sales. Advertising is a powerful tool to persuade consumers and create awareness of a product. The store's heavy advertising campaign, targeting the growing excitement surrounding the marathon, is likely to attract the attention of potential participants and other fitness-minded consumers. Furthermore, the presence of a cash prize of 10,000 for the winner of the marathon can also act as an incentive for athletes and marathon enthusiasts to try every available strategy to increase their chances of winning, including the use of amino acid supplements. The allure of the prize money might push individuals to experiment with new products or strategies, even if scientific evidence regarding their efficacy is limited. Lastly, with the marathon being held in Chicago, a densely populated urban area, the sporting goods store is likely to have a larger potential customer base. The increased visibility of the marathon in the local community will create buzz around the event and related products, further boosting sales potential. In conclusion, given the competitive nature of the athletes participating in the marathon, the increased advertising efforts by the sporting goods store, and the overall excitement surrounding the event, it is reasonable to expect an increase in sales of amino acid supplements during the time leading up to the race. However, it is worth noting that individuals looking to improve their athletic performance should prioritize a healthy and balanced diet, as the actual benefits of amino acid supplementation for athletes are still inconclusive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: I travel a lot at work, so I tend to eat out a lot. What are suggestions for how I can control my calorie intake? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer 1: To determine how many calories you need to eat when you start road cycling, we'll need to consider a few additional factors, such as the distance and intensity of your cycling sessions, your weight, and your overall goals (such as weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain). Here's a step-by-step process to estimate your calorie needs: Step 1: Determine the calories burned during road cycling. On average, a person can burn approximately 400-600 calories per hour of road cycling, depending on intensity and weight.  Step 2: Calculate your cycling sessions per week and estimate total calories burned. For example, if you cycle for one hour, three times a week, you might burn approximately 1200-1800 calories from cycling. Step 3: Combine your normal calorie intake (2000 calories) with the additional calories burned from road cycling. If you want to maintain your current weight, add these burned calories to your regular intake (e.g., 2000 + 1200 = 3200 calories per week). Step 4: Divide the total calories by seven to estimate your daily calorie needs. For our example, 3200 / 7 = approximately 457 calories per day more than your regular intake. This would bring your daily intake to around 2457 calories per day. Keep in mind that these numbers are approximate, and individual factors may vary. It's important to listen to your body and adjust your calorie intake accordingly. Answer 2: Controlling calorie intake while eating out can be challenging but manageable with some simple strategies: 1. Research the menu beforehand and make healthier choices. Many restaurants have their menus available online, allowing you to plan your meal ahead of time. 2. Watch portion sizes. Restaurant portions can be more significant than necessary. Consider asking for a half portion, sharing a meal with a colleague, or packing half of your meal to eat later. 3. Limit high-calorie beverages like sugary drinks and alcohol. Opt for water or low-calorie alternatives. 4. Choose dishes that are steamed, grilled, or baked, instead of fried, and ask for sauces and dressings on the side. 5. Opt for a salad, vegetables, or fruit as your side dish instead of fries or other high-calorie options. 6. Be mindful of overall caloric intake throughout the day. If you know you'll be eating out for dinner, try and have a lighter lunch or breakfast. The answers to these questions are not the same. The first answer provides a method for calculating your calories when you start road cycling. The second answer offers strategies for controlling calorie intake while eating out, which could help in maintaining a balanced diet regardless of your physical activity levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the meantime bank robbers hijack an armored car. When the police arrive to stop Shawn from jumping, the one of the bank robbers accidentally get caught (Thompson). The cops break up the robbery, but one of the robbers, Charlie Anders (played by Beesley), takes Shawn hostage by threatening to shoot her. They make a deal: she will help him escape if he promises to kill her afterwards. As poetic justice, the bank vice-president was a collaborator in the robbery but is arrested. The film begins at the moment when Shawn and Charlie jump into the water, then jumps back to 24 hours earlier. In the scenes when Charlie and Shawn are hiding out near his boat, you can see the clock moving backwards.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Yes, the statement \\"Radio transcription producers such as World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers (AMP) were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system and towards the end of the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business.\\" does contain the correct answer to \\"Who was responsible for 2/3 of all recordings in the 1930s?\\"  The provided statement gives a clear indication of the companies that had a hold over two-thirds of the radio transcription business during that time period, specifically World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers. They were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system, which was a crucial technology during the 1930s for audio recording and distribution. This wide range system allowed for significantly improved audio fidelity, which helped these two companies to be dominant in the radio transcription market.  World Broadcasting System was founded in 1929 by renowned radio broadcaster and engineer Edward J. Noble. The company aimed to produce high-quality pre-recorded radio programs to be distributed across various radio stations in the United States. They implemented the Western Electric wide range system to ensure high-quality recording and transmission of their programs, which in turn made them a dominant player in the radio transcription business.  Associated Music Publishers (AMP) was another key player in this market space that focused specifically on the publishing and distribution of music-related content. Founded in 1919 by Max Dreyfus and his brothers, it was a thriving publishing company that catered to a wide range of genres, including classical, jazz, and popular music. Through their use of the Western Electric wide range system, AMP was able to make high-quality recordings and distribute them to radio stations, further solidifying their significant role in the market. Together, the World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers captured two-thirds of the entire radio transcription business by the end of the 1930s, making them the primary entities responsible for the majority of recordings during that time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we're going to talk about a story that's happening in a big city called New York. New York is a place where lots of people live and work, and it has tall buildings and many exciting places to visit. Sometimes, when people grow up, they get important jobs where they have to make decisions to help keep the city safe and healthy. One of these jobs is called the \\"Health Chief.\\" The Health Chief is in charge of making sure everyone in the city can see a doctor if they are sick and that the air we breathe and the water we drink is clean. But do you know what? There is some news about the Health Chief in New York that not everyone is happy about. Some people are saying that the Health Chief did not do their job properly. They say the Health Chief used their power in a bad way. This is called \\"abusing power.\\" Abusing power is not a good thing because it can hurt other people, and it's not how we're supposed to do our jobs or treat each other. Now, the grown-ups in New York who are in charge of keeping the city running smoothly are looking into what the Health Chief did wrong. They want to make sure everybody has a chance to stay healthy and that nobody uses their power in a not-so-nice way again. So, what does this mean for our big city of New York? Well, when someone abuses their power, it means the grown-ups need to step in and figure out what went wrong. They will try to find a solution so that everyone can continue to work together and make sure the city is a safe and healthy place to live. In the end, it is important for everyone with important jobs to remember to always use their power for good and never for their own benefit.

Towson University’s champion cheerleaders have been suspended for hazing. The Baltimore school’s cheerleading squad has been suspended for a recent hazing incident that the school has not yet disclosed. An investigation into the matter has been completed, but an appeal is still on-going, Gay Pinder, media relations, told MailOnline. The university first learned of the allegations Aug. 6. A total of 10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed, Ms Pinder told MailOnline, adding that they went unharmed. No title defense: Despite an automatic place in the next cheer championships, in 2014, it appears unlikely the team will defend its title. The team has been suspended for the entire 2013-2014 academic year, according to Ms. Pinder. First enacted while the university looked into the allegations, the punishment stood after the investigation was completed. The suspension was first reported by the university’s student newspaper The Torchlight. ‘Towson has a policy of no hazing and we do take that very seriously, said Ms. Pinder, ‘we have high expectations of our students and expect them to treat each other with the utmost respect.’ The school has not yet released the details surrounding exactly how the students were hazed, and Ms Pinder declined to provide those details to MailOnline. Champions: The squad won the most recent Division I cheer championships, earning an automatic bid in next year's tournament. Banned: Towson University's cheerleading team has been suspended following allegations of hazing. It is not clear if this is the first incident of hazing involving the cheer team, according to Ms Pinder.While sports teams have usually been in the hazing spotlight, pep squads have been outed as hazers as well. A drum major at Florida A&M University died after a 2011 hazing incident during which he was beaten by several members of the school band. ‘I have never heard of a whole team getting suspended,’ Jim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators told the Baltimore Sun. ‘That is pretty rare, maybe unheard of,’ he added. In April, Towson’s cheerleaders placed first in the All-Girl Division I section of the National Cheerleaders Association's Collegiate Cheerleading Championship. Their win proffered them an automatic spot in the 2014 competition, one they look unlikely to attend. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Towson University's champion cheerleading squad was suspended for the 2013-2014 academic year due to a hazing incident involving 10 incoming freshmen co-eds. The university completed an investigation into the allegations and upheld the suspension. While details of the hazing were not disclosed, it was reported that the students went unharmed. This suspension makes it unlikely for the team to defend its title at the next cheer championships in 2014."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is aboard the NASA space shuttle Explorer for her first space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. En route to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the substantially damaged but still operational ISS, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two Soyuz modules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, 100Â km (60Â mi) away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite...

Came here to meet some work colleagues for lunch.  First thing I noticed when I arrived, the have a very nice terrace (Patio in other provinces) to eat on outside.  Entering inside you get a wafting smell of fresh popcorn.  Not really the smell I cared for at lunch but oh well!    Met up with my work colleagues and we sat in a big booth.  The place is decorated in sports bar paraphenalia with TV's on in the background.    I ordered the chicken quesidillas with a house salad.  The chicken quesos came out as a generous serving with the shell crispy brown on the edges.  Taste was okay, the texture of the chicken however tasted like it was hacked by a blind woodsmen with a very dull knife.  On a scale of 1 - 5 I'd rate it a 2.5/5.    Service was okay, the server mentioned to us our meals were the full serving and didn't come with the coffee.  Oh well.

Two people went to the eye doctor's office for an annual exam; James had farsightedness, while Bob had perfect 20/20 vision.  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: How did the scientists reach the finding?

In this statement, we learn that during the month of July, a company called CWT has managed to gain majority control over a joint venture they have in India. Let us break down the statement further to understand its implications and context. 1. In July: This sets the timeframe of the event, stating that it takes place in the month of July. It does not specify a year, so we can only assume that it refers to the most recent or upcoming July from the time the statement was made. 2. CWT: This refers to a company or organization by the acronym CWT. Without further context, we cannot be sure which company it refers to. However, some possibilities include Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a global business travel management company, or CWT Limited, a Singapore-based logistics and supply chain solutions provider. 3. Gains majority control: This implies that CWT has secured over 50% ownership or voting rights in the joint venture. Majority control would give CWT significant influence over the operations, strategy, and decision-making of the joint venture, effectively giving them control of its management and direction. 4. Of Indian joint venture: This provides information about the location and nature of the entity in question. The joint venture is based in India, which means that it operates within the Indian market, potentially leveraging local resources, knowledge, and connections. A joint venture is a type of business arrangement between two or more parties who pool their resources and expertise to achieve a specific goal or to enter a new market. This type of entity is usually created to share risks, costs, and benefits between the involved parties. Taking all of these aspects into consideration, the statement provides insight into a strategic move by CWT to solidify its position in the Indian market by acquiring majority control in a joint venture. This move likely signals the company's commitment to and confidence in the potential of this market. The joint venture could be in any industry related to CWT's core business, such as travel, logistics, or supply chain management. It would be relevant for those who follow CWT or have an interest in the industry or Indian market to keep an eye on further developments or announcements related to this joint venture. This move could lead to expanded operations, more significant market share, or the introduction of new products and services by the joint venture, ultimately impacting CWT's overall business growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - movies - school - theatre - event - new york  The rationale to choose \\"movies\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"movies.\\" The rationale for this choice revolves around the context provided in the question and general customs associated with each option. At intermission, people viewing a performance often take a break. Intermissions are common in theaters (for plays), concerts, and other live performances to provide the audience and performers a brief respite. However, the critical clue in this question is the mention of popcorn purchasing during intermission. Out of the options provided - movies, school, theatre, event, and New York - the practice of having an intermission for popcorn purchasing aligns best with movie-watching customs. In movie theaters, there is traditionally a snack counter where audiences can buy drinks, candy, and notably popcorn. Popcorn and movies have been mentally linked for many people given this long-standing custom, making it conventional for audiences to enjoy popcorn while watching a movie. Additionally, although it's uncommon, some extended movie screenings may have intermissions during which viewers can buy snacks and use the comfort room. On the other hand, the other choices in the list - school, theatre, event, and New York - either don't typically include popcorn as part of the experience or don't regularly include intermissions in the same way as movies.  Schools typically do not have intermissions where students and teachers can buy popcorn—break times are used for other purposes like studying, eating lunch, or socializing. In theatre-setting, although there could be an intermission, popcorn is not usually part of the theatre etiquette—it is seen as distracting and could even detract from the immersive experience of the performance because of the noise it might create. In general events, the intermission structure and popcorn's place is highly variable and not consistent. As for \\"New York,\\" it's not an activity or event but rather a place, making it an unlikely answer to the question. While one could argue that there are movie theaters in New York, it isn't specific enough compared to the direct relevance of \\"movies.\\"\\"\\" So, given the popcorn purchase during an intermission, the most plausible scenario would indeed be, watching a movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement focuses on Napoleon's role in the Haitian Revolution and his decision related to slavery, which can be deemed controversial and affecting his reputation. However, it does not provide any information about the person or entity that specifically accused Napoleon of being untroubled by war and death for thousands. In order to answer the question on who charged that Napoleon was untroubled by the prospect of war and death for thousands, we need to dive deeper into history and the people who were critical of Napoleon's actions during his reign. There were numerous contemporaries, politicians, and historians who had differing views on his leadership and actions. One such person is the British writer, Thomas Paine, who had accused Napoleon of having no regard for the lives of the people he ruled over. In April 1797, Paine wrote a letter to Napoleon, stating that \\"The history of the expedition, which you made to Italy under the command of General Bonaparte, is now no longer a secret... You have no respect for life, you have often, with all the coolness of calculation, risked the lives of two or three hundred men to avoid a trifling expense.” Paine's words reflect his concerns about Napoleon's willingness to casually risk lives for conquest and power. Another person who charged Napoleon with being untroubled by war and death was Madame de Staël, a prominent woman of letters during the Napoleonic era and widely known for her opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte. She consistently spoke critically of him and his reign, accusing him of causing much suffering and havoc in his quest for power. Furthermore, the French politician François-René, vicomte de Chateaubriand, also expressed concern over Napoleon's ambitions and disregard for human life. In his influential book \\"Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe,\\" Chateaubriand criticized Napoleon, stating, \\"He weighed everything in the balance of his ambition and his interests; the millions of men crushed beneath the wheel of his colossal car had no more influence on his soul than the dust raised by its passage.\\" In summary, while the statement on Napoleon's role in the Haitian Revolution and the decision to reinstate slavery correctly highlights some controversial aspects of his reign, it does not answer the question of who charged him with being untroubled by the prospect of war and death for thousands. Various figures, including Thomas Paine, Madame de Staël, and François-René de Chateaubriand, criticized and accused Napoleon of having little regard for human life in his pursuit of power and conquest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: Text: obligatory, not today but... about a year and a half ago... background: i have a congenital heart defect known as a \\"bicuspid aortic valve\\". it is not a huge deal, and not uncommon, but can become very serious, and has the potential to see you just drop dead if it is not monitored, especially for the unfortunates that are never diagnosed. basically, blood flows back in with every pump, and the valve can calcify over time and require replacement - the options for which are limited and not ideal. besides getting tired a little easier, and not being able to do things that rapidly raise blood pressure (like power lifting), it doesn't affect me much. however, in 2015, at one of my checkups, it was found that i had developed an aortic aneurysm. i was told that it still had a bit to grow until it became urgent, but also that there was a chance it could burst, and cause, well… you get the point, and this is where the fuckup truly starts. i had known that i had my condition since i was about twelve, but having it finally present a real and present problem brought it from the abstract to the all-too-real. being the totally not-anxious, happy-go-lucky guy who doesn't know the meaning of existential crisis that i am, i began panicking at every slight chest pain - which i have frequently due to an unrelated condition. *it’s fun, gives me energy, and is a great way to stay in shape.* a few months later i was driving back from a meeting in a town about 50 minutes away from home, and i began to feel chest pain along with some other disconcerting symptoms: numbness and lack of mobility in my extremities, face tightening, eyelids twitching. after nearly pulling over and calling an ambulance several times, i decided i was close enough to drive myself to the er, so i stopped briefly and used my defunct digits to mash out directions to the nearest hospital on google maps. about 20 minutes later, i had made it to the hospital, and walked in with what i am sure was a look of sheer terror on my face, as the security guard at the intake didn't bother to ask me to empty my pockets and whatnot. lpt: if you go into an er saying you have a heart condition, and are experiencing chest pain - to the front of the line you go. not sure if this works for other lines, but feel free to try. an older couple waiting (and apparently, not *dying*) were not pleased with my usurping their place in the queue, but we would meet again later. after the basic hospital intake stuff, and speaking with the doctor, most of my symptoms subsided and i began to feel embarrassed for freaking out. i apologized to the physician multiple times, and sheepishly told him i was just going to go home. after quite a bit of convincing – and worrying about the cost (because i live in the us, and it is generally cheaper to just go ahead and die) – he persuaded me to at least stay and get a ct-scan, just in case. as they moved me to radiology, in obvious “this guy might die” mode, we pass the old man half of the couple from earlier; his eyes apologized for him. the ct-scan was completed, and i was wheeled back to my room for about 3 minutes before the doctor came back in with a look on his face that you never want to see from an er doctor, police officer, emt, parent, friend, or anyone. ever.  “your aneurysm has ruptured, and the cardiac surgeon is on his way, but i need you to stay calm to keep it from escalating” so, of course, insta-panic. after hyperventilating enough to bring back the numbness and twitching (which is what had caused those symptoms in the first place), i did eventually manage – with the help of a very kind nurse – to mellow out a bit and call my family. my brother and girlfriend were waiting at the bar for me, and she did not hear her phone, so i called my brother: “hey, man. when you comin’? thought you would have been here by now…” “i need you to call mom and dad right away. my aneurysm ruptured and they are rushing me into emergency surgery. i am at ___________ hospital.” “oh fuck. fuck. fuck. ok, ok man, i love you. hang on we’ll be right there.” “ok, thanks. i love you too, little buddy.” with a quickness that only comes from such a situation, my family showed up in what was both an impossibly short, and absolutely interminable amount of time. the medical team that had by now amassed around me (doctor, several nurses, anesthesiologist, and newly-arrived cardiac surgeon) explained to my family what was happening, and the cardiac surgeon sat down to ask me some questions and explain the procedure. first, he told me that they would try to save the valve as it was still working fine, but would likely have to go ahead and replace it, so i needed to decide if i wanted a tissue (porcine/cadaver), or artificial valve. the former only has about an 8-10 year lifespan before you need to be opened up again; the latter can last a lifetime, but requires blood thinners forever. like i said earlier, not ideal either way, but i was not willing to have to take blood thinners every day to not die at 29. seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, and after a prompt from my father attempting to do the same, i requested a tiger valve if it wasn’t too much trouble.  next, the surgeon briefly explained the procedure: “we are going to open up your chest, and fill your chest cavity with ice to stop your heart while a machine circulates your blood. after fixing the aneurysm, and possibly replacing the valve, we will *try* to revive you.” try!? why use that word? i mean, maybe some people get some comfort from having what happens next described… i. did. not. *i know what a lot of you are probably thinking here: “that doesn’t sound like they rushed at all if it was such an emergency”. the entire time from scan results, to going under, was no more than 25 minutes, and i was conscious, my heart rate was stable (but elevated), and my other vitals were good. i am sure they would have moved faster if i had started flopping like a fish and making that awful dying-guy snoring sound.* so, i begged them not to let me die on my birthday (forgot that lovely tidbit; it was my 29th birthday) as that would be “so fucked up” (because everything was just peachy otherwise), and told them “let’s get on with it then”. moments later i was under, and on my way to the or. many hours later, i can’t fully recall just how long, i was in a recovery room coming out of the anesthesia. this part was told to me by my family; i do not remember anything but snippets. i very politely asked for a glass of water, and then proceeded – one by one – to inform each member of my family and the medical staff present, that “my balls itch” – “my balls itch” – “my balls itch”. of course, i was groggily itching my balls as i made this important announcement.  a few more hours pass, and i remember fully coming around. as you could imagine, the first thing i did was to look at my chest for the damage. only, there was none. i was shaved (which sucked for quite a while after as i am hairy like ape), but had no sign of having been operated on. my brother, half-asleep on a chair next to me, saw that i was awake, and i asked him what the fuck was going on. he said it would be better to just wait and let the doctors explain. he went and retrieved the surgeon, who explained that the initial ct-scan had given a false positive. they had me on the operating table, but part of the procedure is to stick an ultrasound device of some kind down the throat to better pinpoint the area of the aneurysm. when they did this, they could not find it, so they sent me back for a “gated” ct-scan, which apparently times the pictures with your heartbeat. why they did not do this in the first place is beyond me, and i didn’t think to ask at the time. my brother seemed upset that they had almost cut me open for no reason, but i told him it was fine, and that i was just glad to be alive and un-filleted. i was shown the original scan, and even to a lay person, it looked pretty fucking bad; i don’t blame the medical staff one bit for treating it the way they did. one thing i **do** blame them for is not telling me how badly it was going to hurt the first time i peed, due to the catheter that had been inserted (and removed while i was unconscious, thank god). after a day of observation, “recovery”, and one of the most guilt-free hearthstone binges i will ever be afforded, i was discharged with a blood pressure/heart rate monitor, some beta blockers (blood pressure meds), and mercifully – diazepam. it is over a year later, i have the aneurysm checked every 6-12 months, and its progress is slow enough to give me at least a few more years to pray that medical technology advances far enough to offer me less invasive surgery (this looks promising) and better valve replacement options (haven’t seen anything encouraging here). i still panic a little when i have chest pains, but i have gotten marginally better at managing my reactions – at least enough to have not been to the hospital again.    edit: thank you all so much for the support and information, i am working on responding to all you wonderful internet strangers, and glad you enjoyed my story. in the mean time, have [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/h1hvh) .

I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Peace and nonviolence are not outdated concepts, but rather essential principles that remain relevant in today's world. Both peace and nonviolence promote harmony, mutual understanding, and cooperation, which are crucial for sustainable development and the well-being of all living beings on the planet. However, it is essential to recognize that finding solutions to conflicts may sometimes be difficult, and the concept of peace should be examined in both contemporary and historical contexts. There are several reasons why peace and nonviolence are not outdated. The most obvious is the continued existence of conflicts and wars, which threaten global stability and security. In fact, some argue that the world needs more commitment to nonviolence due to the presence of modern technological advancements, such as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. These powerful and devastating weapons can lead to unimaginable consequences if conflict arises, emphasizing the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve disagreements. Furthermore, nonviolence is a practice well-grounded in various philosophies and religious traditions. For instance, Buddhism, Christianity, and Jainism all advocate for nonviolence and peace as part of ethical living, encouraging compassion and love towards others. Additionally, various historical figures, such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., demonstrated that nonviolent approaches could achieve significant political and social change. Peace and nonviolence also have practical benefits in modern times. They encourage the resolution of disputes in a way that avoids further escalation of violence, helps to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, fosters trust among nations, and builds bridges of understanding that could lead to long-lasting cooperation. Moreover, the investment in peace and nonviolent conflict resolution has positive economic consequences. When there is a decrease in spending on military expenses and war reconstruction, resources can be redirected towards improving social, educational, and healthcare infrastructure, benefiting societies as a whole. Should we always seek peace? While the idea of always seeking peace may seem utopian, it is essential to promote a culture of peace whenever possible. Such a culture encourages open dialogue, cooperation, and understanding, and works towards resolving conflicts through nonviolent means. This can include negotiation, mediation, and diplomacy. However, it is important to recognize that some situations may necessitate the use of force, such as in cases of self-defense or to prevent mass atrocities. In these instances, exhausting all peaceful options should be a prerequisite before resorting to forceful means. Now, let us examine if the questions \\"Are peace and nonviolence outdated concepts?\\" and \\"Should we always seek peace?\\" are the same. While these questions deal with similar concepts, they are not the same. The first question aims to determine whether peace and nonviolence are still relevant in modern times, whereas the second question asks if seeking peace should always be our primary goal. The first question is concerned with the overall relevance of these principles, while the second question deals with whether peaceful solutions should be prioritized in all situations. In summary, while both questions are related to peace and nonviolence, they address distinct aspects of these ideas, making them different from one another."},{"instruction":"Q: Fact 1: Adrought can change the color of an environment from green to brown.

And I was wondering What did Kendall do? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Kendall was quite determined to ensure Tracy would agree to go see Lady Gaga with her. Given that she wouldn't take no for an answer, we can imagine several actions and strategies Kendall might have employed to persuade Tracy. Here are some possible scenarios detailing what Kendall could have done: 1. Encouraging Tracy with enthusiasm:     Kendall might have shared her excitement and enthusiasm for the concert, detailing how fantastic Lady Gaga is as a live performer and how much fun they would have together at the event. By sharing her positive experiences and highlighting the unique aspects of the concert, Kendall could have enticed Tracy to agree to go with her. 2. Offering additional incentives:     To sweeten the deal, Kendall could have offered to cover some of Tracy's expenses for the event, such as her ticket or transportation costs. Similarly, she could have suggested making a full day or weekend out of the event by adding fun activities or meals before or after the concert to create even more appeal for attending. 3. Addressing Tracy's concerns:     Kendall might also have taken the time to listen to any reservations or concerns Tracy may have had about attending the concert. By being empathetic and understanding, she could have worked to alleviate those concerns, whether it was finding solutions to logistical issues, such as arranging transportation or accommodations, or addressing any anxiety Tracy might have about large crowds or unfamiliar venues. 4. Highlighting the rare opportunity:     Another potential approach Kendall could have taken was to emphasize the rarity of such an event. Lady Gaga concerts might not happen frequently, particularly in the specific area where they live, and attending a live performance could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By pointing this out, Kendall might have been able to convince Tracy that experiencing the concert together would be a special and memorable occasion. 5. Involving mutual friends:     To create more appeal for the event, Kendall may have invited other mutual friends to join them in attending the concert. By making it a group outing, Tracy might have felt more comfortable and excited about the idea, knowing they would be with familiar people and in a fun, social setting. 6. Persistent persuasion:     Lastly, it's possible that Kendall used a combination of these methods or simply continued to bring up the concert over time in different conversations. By doing this, she could have engaged Tracy's interest, worn down any resistance, and ultimately gotten her to agree. In conclusion, while we can only speculate about the specific details, it's evident that Kendall was committed to persuading Tracy to attend the Lady Gaga concert with her.

The board broke in half when shot by the arrow because the","output":"force exerted by the arrow upon impact was greater than the structural integrity of the board, causing it to fracture and ultimately break apart. The factors that contributed to the board's breaking can be examined from various perspectives, such as the materials used, the design of the arrow, and the kinetic energy involved in the process.  First, let's focus on the board's material properties. The board would have been made from a specific type of material, such as wood, plastic, or composite. Each of these materials has a different strength, stiffness, and density, which will all affect how it responds to an external force. For example, wood is a natural material that has a relatively low density compared to plastics and composites, but it is also quite strong and durable. However, if a board made of wood contains knots, imperfections, or areas of low-quality grain orientation, its overall structural strength will be reduced, making it more susceptible to breaking when subjected to a force such as that imparted by the arrow. Secondly, the design of the arrow plays a crucial role in determining the force it can exert upon impact. Arrows can be made of various materials such as wood, aluminum, carbon fiber, or a combination of different materials. The weight, stiffness, and aerodynamics of the arrow will all affect its performance in flight and during impact. If the arrow used in the present case shot with sufficient velocity and precision, it could generate enough concentrated force at the point of impact to ultimately break the board in half. This is especially true if the arrow was equipped with a broadhead, which is designed to create more significant damage upon impact, rather than a traditional field point that would typically be used for target practice. Now let's delve into the kinetic energy and the physics involved in the process. The kinetic energy of an object in motion (such as the arrow in flight) can be defined by the equation KE = 0.5mv^2, where KE represents the kinetic energy, m is the object's mass, and v is the object's velocity. The higher an object's mass and velocity, the greater its kinetic energy will be. When the arrow makes contact with the board, this kinetic energy is transferred to the board. As a result, the board experiences a force that acts on a very localized area (assuming the arrowhead to be relatively small), which may exceed the stress-bearing capacity of that area. From the physics standpoint, the force applied to the board can be described by the equation F = ma, where F is the force, m is the object's mass, and a is the object's acceleration. As the arrow's mass and acceleration increase, the force exerted on the board also increases. Finally, it is essential to consider the cumulative effect of all these factors. The board's material properties and any inherent weaknesses, the design and characteristics of the arrow, and the kinetic energy generated during the arrow's flight all contribute to the force experienced by the board when struck. If this force is greater than the board's ability to withstand such stress, the board will ultimately break apart, as evidenced by the given scenario. In conclusion, the board broke in half when shot by the arrow due to a combination of factors that led to an overwhelming force being exerted on the board, surpassing its structural integrity and causing it to fracture. By examining the materials, the arrow's design, and the physics involved, it becomes clear that multiple elements contributed to this outcome. Therefore, improving any one of these aspects may help prevent similar incidents in the future, either by increasing the structural strength of the board or by reducing the force with which the arrow impacts it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Alice Li/The Washington Post)      China hacked into the federal government’s network, compromising four million current and former employees' information. The Post's Ellen Nakashima talks about what kind of national security risk this poses and why China wants this information. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)      Hackers working for the Chinese state breached the computer system of the Office of Personnel Management in December, U.S. officials said Thursday, and the agency will notify about 4 million current and former federal employees that their personal data may have been compromised.      The hack was the largest breach of federal employee data in recent years. It was the second major intrusion of the same agency by China in less than a year and the second significant foreign breach into U.S. government networks in recent months.Last year, Russia compromised White House and State Department e-mail systems in a campaign of cyber­espionage.      [What to do if your information was stolen]      The OPM, using new tools, discovered the breach in April, according to officials at the agency who declined to discuss who was behind the hack.      Other U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation, identified the hackers as being state-sponsored.      One private security firm, iSight Partners, says it has linked the OPM intrusion to the same cyber­espionage group that hacked the health insurance giant Anthem. The FBI suspects that that intrusion, announced in February, was also the work of Chinese hackers, people close to the investigation have said.      The intruders in the OPM case gained access to information that included employees’ Social Security numbers, job assignments, performance ratings and training information, agency officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether payroll data was exposed other than to say that no direct-      deposit information was compromised. They could not say for certain what data was taken, only what the hackers gained access to.      [China calls the accusation ‘irresponsible and unscientific’]      “Certainly, OPM is a high-value target,” Donna Seymour, the agency’s chief information officer, said in an interview. “We have a lot of information about people, and that is something that our adversaries want.”      The personal information exposed could be useful in crafting “spear-phishing” e-mails, which are designed to fool recipients into opening a link or an attachment so that the hacker can gain access to computer systems. Using the stolen OPM data, for instance, a hacker might send a fake e-mail purporting to be from a colleague at work.      After the earlier breach discovered in March 2014, the OPM undertook “an aggressive effort to update our cybersecurity posture, adding numerous tools and capabilities to our networks,” Seymour said. “As a result of adding these tools, we were able to detect this intrusion into our networks.”      “Protecting our federal employee data from malicious cyber incidents is of the highest priority at OPM,” Director Katherine Archuleta said in a statement.      Katherine Archuleta, shown in November in Arlington, is director of the Office of Personnel Management. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)      In the current incident, the hackers targeted an OPM data center housed at the Interior Department. The database did not contain information on background investigations or employees applying for security clear­ances, officials said.      By contrast, in March 2014, OPM officials discovered that hackers had breached an OPM system that manages sensitive data on federal employees applying for clearances. That often includes financial data, information about family and other sensitive details. That breach, too, was attributed to China, other officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether the data affected in this incident was encrypted or had sensitive details masked. They said it appeared that the intruders are no longer in the system.      “There is no current activity,” an official said. But Chinese hackers frequently try repeat intrusions.      [The real story of how the Internet became so vulnerable]      Seymour said the agency is working to better protect the data stored in its servers throughout the government, including by using data masking or redaction. “We’ve purchased tools to be able to implement that capability for all” the data, she said.      Among the steps taken to protect the network, the OPM restricted remote access to the network by system administrators, officials said. When the OPM discovered the breach, it notified the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.      A senior DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the “good news” is that the OPM discovered the breach using the new tools. “These things are going to keep happening, and we’re going to see more and more because our detection techniques are improving,” the official said.      FBI spokesman Josh Campbell said his agency is working with DHS and OPM officials to investigate the incident. “We take all potential threats to public- and private-sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” he said.      The intruders used a “zero-day” — a previously unknown cyber-tool — to take advantage of a vulnerability that allowed the intruders to gain access into the system.      [Why the Internet’s massive flaws may never get fixed]      China is one of the most aggressive nations targeting U.S. and other Western states’ networks. In May 2014, the United States announced the indictments of five Chinese military officials for economic cyber­espionage — hacking into the computers of major steel and other companies and stealing plans, sensitive negotiating details and other information.      “China is everywhere,” said Austin Berglas, head of cyber investigations at K2 Intelligence and a former top cyber official at the FBI’s New York field office. “They’re looking to gain social and economic and political advantage over the United States in any way they can. The easiest way to do that is through theft of intellectual property and theft of sensitive information.”      Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the past few months have seen a massive series of data breaches affecting millions of Americans.      “This latest intrusion . . . is among the most shocking because Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defenses,” he said. “The cyberthreat from hackers, criminals, terrorists and state actors is one of the greatest challenges we face on a daily basis, and it’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue.”      Colleen M. Kelley, president of the nation’s ­second-largest federal worker union, the National Treasury Employees Union, said her organization “is very concerned” about the breach. “Data security, particularly in an era of rising incidence of identity theft, is a critically important matter,” she said.      “It is vital to know as soon as possible the extent to which, if any, personal information may have been obtained so that affected employees can be notified promptly and encouraged to take all possible steps to protect themselves from financial or other risks,” she said.

The lawsuit is based on the grounds that the company's advertisements may mislead consumers, making them believe that Vitaminwater is a healthy alternative to traditional soft drinks and that it can provide numerous health benefits. Step 1: Research the issue To write this text, I delved into the details of the lawsuit, the claims made by the advocacy group, and Coca-Cola's response. This provided a clear understanding of the controversy and the key points to include in the text. Step 2: Introduce the main topic The introductory paragraph highlights the primary subject of the text - the lawsuit filed by an advocacy group against Coca-Cola over their marketing practices for Vitaminwater. Step 3: Explain the allegations In the second paragraph, the allegations made by the advocacy group are presented, specifically stating that the marketing practices for Vitaminwater are deceptive and that the company is attempting to mislead consumers. Step 4: Note Coca-Cola's response Although the text does not delve deeply into the company's response to the lawsuit, it is essential to acknowledge that Coca-Cola is expected to defend itself in the ongoing legal battle. This ensures that the text doesn't seem one-sided and keeps the reader informed about both parties' perspectives. Step 5: End with a call to action Finally, the text encourages readers to stay informed about the outcome of the lawsuit and to critically analyze marketing claims in general. In doing so, readers are urged to be wary of potentially deceptive advertising by companies and make well-informed decisions about their consumption choices. By following these steps, the text effectively informs readers about the legal action taken by the advocacy group against Coca-Cola and highlights the concerns surrounding the marketing of Vitaminwater as a health product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings.

Available options: I. The Center Kingdom II. not enough information III. Silver's Drey IV. The mountains Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Miliband's war on hedge funds could damage City of London “This is potentially much worse than we initially thought. It's effectively FTT by another name,” said one source, who asked not to be named. The Treasury, led by Chancellor George Osborne, has continued to resist the European Union’s attempts to impose the FTT in the UK, for fear of the negative impact it could have on the City of London. It remains unclear how Mr Miliband might restrict the end of the relief solely to hedge funds, given intermediary tax relief benefits a variety of investors. Russell Morgan, EY tax partner, said: \\"While the detail of the proposals isn't clear yet it's going to be hard to design a a new rule that could target only the hedge fund industry and not individual investors and others who choose to invest in UK shares through derivatives for a wide variety of reasons.\\" Jack Inglis, chief executive of AIMA, the hedge fund lobby group, added: “It is misleading to describe this as a measure targeted specifically at hedge funds. This is a well-known investment strategy that is utilised by all levels of market participants including pension funds, insurance companies, traditional asset managers and individual investors.\\" “Labour hit pension funds back in 1997, and spent the last 13 years trying to recover its reputation,” said another source. “I’m surprised they seem to want to do this again.” In all, Labour plans to raise a total of £1.1bn from clamping down on tax avoidance, with the remaining £500m coming from closing the ‘Eurobonds’ loophole which allows large companies to move profits out of the UK – a loophole HM Revenue and Customs ruled against closing two years – and clamping down on so-called ‘umbrella companies.’ The remaining £1.4bn will come from the mansion tax and the tax on tobacco companies. Business big and small moved to rebuff Mr Miliband’s plans, with John Cridland, director general of the CBI questioning the Labour leader’s apparent lack of economic vision. “We heard very little about how to create the economic growth to deliver these ambitions and the crucial role of healthy and thriving businesses in creating prosperity for all.\\" John Longworth, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, concurred, saying “some elements of his speech are likely to be seen as short-term political expediency, and could create uncertainty for business which runs counter to the need for long-term strategic vision and investment.” Those likely to be the losers from Mr Miliband’s policies – which include a further hit on the profits of Britain’s banks – were also less than impressed. Rob Perrins, managing director of house builder Berkeley Group, branded the mansion tax as “misconceived.” \\"The way to grow our economy is to make it competitive and open. Don’t turn property into a liability and penalise the many Londoners who are asset rich but cash poor,” he warned. The tobacco lobby was also not amused, with the Tobacco Manufacturers Association branding the profits tax as “illogical.” Shares in Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco closed down 2.4pc and 2.05pc respectively.","output":"Ed Miliband's proposed clampdown on tax avoidance from hedge funds could impact the City of London, according to insiders, implying that it may be worse than having the EU's Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). Despite the Treasury resisting the FTT for its possible negative effect on London, doubts remain on the specifics of Miliband's restrictions and how they could be applied solely to hedge funds without affecting other investors. The Labour Party intends to raise £1.1bn by eliminating tax avoidance, targeting the 'Eurobonds' loophole and so-called 'umbrella companies', as well.

We will add the numbers without a variable: 5897 + 13687 = 19584.

Now our equation becomes as follows: 330*u + 19584 = -876 Step 2: Isolate u We want to solve for u, so we will isolate the variable on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 19584 from both sides of the equation: 330*u + 19584 - 19584 = -876 - 19584 330*u = -20460 Step 3: Solve for u Since 330 is multiplied by u, we will divide both sides of the equation by 330 to isolate u: (330*u) / 330 = -20460 / 330 u = -62 So the solution to the equation is u = -62."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you joke about it, it makes you appear that you are desperate for any date. This might not only make you look desperate but also make you look like you do not respect your friends who are in relationships. Can we draw the following conclusion? joking about being single is always unbecoming Available options:  (1). Yes.  (2). It's impossible to say.  (3). No.","output":"(2). It's impossible to say. Joking about being single is not always unbecoming, as it heavily depends on the context, audience, and how the joke is delivered. However, it is essential to be careful when joking about your single status to avoid coming across as desperate or disrespectful to others. There are several ways to avoid looking desperate when discussing your relationship status, and taking a mindful approach to humor can help ensure that you are not perceived negatively. Here are some additional tips to keep in mind: 1. Be self-aware: Before making a joke or comment about your single status, consider how it might be perceived by others. If you feel that it may come across as desperate or disrespectful, find a different way to express your sentiment. 2. Gauge your audience: Understanding your audience is key when making jokes about personal matters. What may be viewed as light-hearted and humorous among close friends might not be as well-received in a more formal setting or with people you do not know well. 3. Avoid overdoing it: While using humor to cope with one's single status is completely normal, try to avoid making jokes about it all the time. This can make it seem like you are constantly seeking validation from others or that you are unhappy with your current relationship status. 4. Find a balance: It's important to strike a balance between joking about your single status and discussing other aspects of your life. People appreciate well-rounded conversations, and it can provide a more substantial connection with others when you discuss a range of topics. 5. Be confident: Confidence is key when it comes to avoiding looking desperate. Embrace your single status and focus on the positives, such as the opportunity to focus on personal growth, hobbies, and self-care. When you radiate confidence, others will be less likely to perceive you as desperate, even when discussing your single status. In conclusion, joking about being single is not always unbecoming, but it's essential to be mindful of the context and how it might be perceived. By following these tips and being self-aware, you can avoid looking desperate while still enjoying light-hearted humor about your relationship status."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It started out good...the opener is a showstopper, but then didn't really get better.  This is a bit of a different-type of Cirque. It's got Cirquelike elements, and there are some seriously spectacular numbers, like their opening and last 2 closing numbers, and a few in the middle like Here Comes the Sun and then the fun Baby You Can Drive my Car...but other than that, they could have made it so much better than it is.  There are SO many Beatles songs to choose from... even I know that, and I am not even a real Beatles fan...and they chose some random slow ones that just did not work with the dance and character numbers they paired them with.   And the slow contemporary, reflective dance numbers in gauzy white linen?? Hello, I can see that on So You Think You Can Dance for free. Give me WAY more fun, jazzy, crazy Idontknowwheretolookrightnow numbers that are going to keep me from zzzz'ing during a 10pm show.

Both questions are inquiring about the value and worth of the Apple MacBook Pro released in late 2016, specifically regarding whether the investment in the product is justified.

Is it worth buying?\\" seeks an opinion about the MacBook Pro released in late 2016 and whether it is a worthwhile purchase. It focuses on the product's features, overall performance, and how it compares to other potential alternatives. It asks for a subjective judgment about the product's value. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Are the new Apple Macbook pros really worth their price?\\" focuses more on the cost-benefit analysis, questioning whether the price of the MacBook Pro is justified considering its features, performance, and design. While still asking for a subjective opinion, this question is more concentrated on the economic aspect and if the buyer would get good value for their money.

While people may have something to say, writing it down isn't the only way to communicate their thoughts. 2. \\"Express yourself\\" - This option is partly valid, as people do write things down to express themselves. However, this option doesn't capture the primary reason for writing, which is to preserve thoughts or information. 3. \\"Not to forget\\" - This option is the most appropriate answer. When people write things down, they often do so to ensure they don't forget important information or ideas. Writing serves as a tangible record that can be referred back to when needed, helping people remember better. 4. \\"Speak loudly\\" - This option is irrelevant, as speaking loudly is not related to writing things down. Moreover, speaking loudly doesn't help in preserving information or ideas in the same way writing does. 5. \\"Move fingers\\" - This option is also irrelevant and doesn't address the reasons people write things down. Moving fingers is simply a physical action involved in writing, not a reason to write.

Question: how old is sybil vane in the picture of dorian gray A:","output":"The question being asked is how old Sybil Vane is in the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, not whether Dorian Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton. Consequently, the 'yes or no' input provided will not suffice as an appropriate response to the given inquiry.  Instead, to answer the underlying question, we can consult the book and determine Sybil Vane's age. In the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, Sybil Vane is introduced as a young actress who takes on a significant role in Dorian Gray's life. Although her exact age is not explicitly stated, it is implied that she is relatively young, likely in her late teens or early twenties. This can be deduced because she is often described as innocent, youthful, and pure. For instance, in Chapter 5, Dorian describes her as being \\"hardly seventeen years of age, with a little flower-like face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.\\" Notably, as the novel takes place during the Victorian era, young women were generally considered marriageable and capable of having their own careers from their late teens onwards.

But Michal Kapral, a 44-year-old editor from Toronto, had a more difficult goal in mind. He wanted to run a marathon ... while juggling ... without dropping a ball even once.      And he did it at the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, at the brisk clip of 2 hours and 55 minutes. That's a pace of about 6:40 per mile.      Kapral tells The Two-Way that he's an old hand at \\"joggling\\" (juggling while jogging, naturally). In fact, this is his eighth joggling marathon. He holds the world record for the \\"fastest marathon while joggling three objects,\\" which he has set multiple times, most recently in 2007 in Toronto. He ran that marathon 5 minutes faster, he says, but dropped the ball twice.      This is the first time that he's managed to complete the race without a single drop. He says the pressure was building as he neared the end of the race: \\"I've never felt so much stress in my life.\\" During the last 400 meters, he says he \\"literally looked at every toss.\\"      VIDEO by @wendyalas: Running the #ChicagoMarathon while juggling in 2:55 without a drop. Here are 10 catches out of 50,000+ #joggling pic.twitter.com/9W6ypaXouv — Michal Kapral (@mkapral) October 11, 2016      Kapral started joggling when he was 11, after flipping through the Guinness Book of World Records for records he might be able to break. He had just learned to juggle, he says, and was a part of his school's cross country team.      About 20 years later, after completing a number of marathons, he thought he'd try joggling one of the races while raising money for charity.      \\"When I first started I just assumed people would just make fun of me, and I started off training running in the dark before dawn while I figured out what I was doing,\\" he says.      But now he's far bolder, and routinely joggles on his commute home or through downtown Toronto.      \\"I think the most common reaction is people stop and just stare. They just stop in their tracks and then their jaw kind of drops, and they get the look of like, 'What did I just see?' \\" Kapral says. \\"It cracks me up.\\"      There's a worldwide community of jogglers, including dozens who contacted him when he first set the world record for marathon joggling in 2005. \\"Ever since then, I hear from someone maybe every two weeks who's in some part of the world who does this,\\" he adds.      Kapral manages to make juggling while running sound like a very natural motion: \\"Every step you take, every stride forward, as your arm swings you toss the ball up to the other side so the juggling cascade pattern matches perfectly with the running stride.\\"      That grows more challenging over the course of 26.2 miles. He explains:      \\"So the beginning, the first few miles, it's kind of relaxing, it's this meditative, kind of zen feeling, with this pattern floating around in front of your face. And it helps keep the rhythm, the juggling. And then after a while, your arms start to tire, and everything gets tired, and then it's just absolute agony the last few miles. It takes this incredible amount of focus. Suddenly you have to focus on every toss.\\"      After experimenting with plastic balls, he says he prefers juggling with handmade beanbags, filled with millet.      Kapral says he wants to try doing a steeplechase while juggling — that's a challenging long-distance race involving multiple barriers and water jumps.      Feeling klutzy by comparison? This tweet might provide some solace: ||||| My hand injury turned out to be a muscle tear.      ⚡️ “Toronto man tries to run entire marathon juggling 5 balls” https://t.co/2JQ4QHRLaH October 26, 2017      I'm just going to throw this out there: Sometimes when you set ridiculously challenging goals for yourself, you will fail. That's exactly what happened to me at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon last Sunday. My goal was to set a new Guinness World Record for the fastest marathon while joggling five objects.There was no current record, but the Guinness records-keepers decided through some calculus that 4 hours 40 minutes was the time to beat. This doesn't sound very quick, but here's the thing: running while simultaneously juggling five balls is exceedingly difficult. To a non-joggler, I might put it like this: joggling a marathon with three balls is like running a regular marathon, while joggling a marathon with five balls is like running a marathon hopping on your left foot only for the entire 42.2km. It's exponentially harder the further the distance.Leading up the race, my training had gone quite well. I practiced running 100m, 200m intervals joggling five balls, and worked my way up to being able to do some 400m joggles around the U of T Varsity track without dropping. But my average drop rate was still around every 100m, which is 422 drops for the marathon. I still thought it might be manageable, but knew based on timing my 100m joggles that a 4:40 marathon would be almost impossible.Lucky for me, I had a chance do some training with five-ball joggling record-holder Matt Feldman, who is incredibly quick at the 400m, mile and 5K.I also had lunch with five-ball joggling legend Barry Goldmeier, who regularly runs large portions of marathons while juggling five beanbags.The week before the race, CTV News and CP24 ran stories about the record attempt.I still can't stop laughing at the fact that I secured a sponsorship from the best cinnamon bun shop in Toronto. Thank you, Rosen's Cinnamon Buns for supporting my joggling dreams. A huge thank-you as well to Cheryl Sayers from Sport Juggling Company for the amazing Sportball beanbags.Zach arrived from D.C. on Friday and we toured Toronto riding BikeShare bikes on Saturday, which was probably not the best thing to do the day before trying to set a world record. I hadn't seen Zach in 10 years, when we raced each other at the 2007 Salt Lake City Marathon. I discovered that he's still one of the greatest people you could ever meet.Zach has worked as a circus performer, and is an expert juggler. The night before the marathon, we went out to practice some joggling to see how close he should follow during the race. Zach tried five-ball joggling and actually had some trouble with it. I realized that all my training had actually worked. I had developed a new skill (perhaps not the most useful skill in the world, but still...).Race day. My nerves were joggling big-time, since I still didn't know if this record was even possible. It was very difficult to tell during my training how the race would play out, since I trained on a track, or on an empty stretch of road in my neighbourhood. Zach and I lined up in the slowest corral for marathon finish times of 4:30 and slower. I decided to start near the front of this group, thinking if I got a good clean start, I could stay up front in the clear and avoid the crowds. But just before the horn sounded for our corral's start, a bunch of runners shimmied in front of me and Zach, and I suddenly found myself squished in a large crowd.I was immediately in a panic, trying to maintain the high tosses of the five-ball juggling pattern. I dropped several times right near the beginning, and scrambled to regroup right away so I didn't interfere with the runners behind me. This caused me to drop even more. I was exhausted almost right from the gun, and it just got worse from there. On the bright side, the spectators were loving it, and Zach shouted encouraging words to pull me out of my panicked state. It was still crowded up until about 3km, but by the time I had slowed enough to have some space to juggle, my energy was sapped. I felt like I had already run a marathon. I should've started at the very back and not worried about trying to run 4:40, but it was too late.In my frenzy, I somehow managed to injure my left hand, which began to hurt more and more with each toss. I hit 5K in 46 minutes, already 13 minutes behind schedule. Zach told me, based on my stride length and toss rate, that I would be making 130,000 tosses and catches for the marathon. It's going to be a long day, I thought. The next 5K took me 56 minutes. My hand was now in serious trouble, shooting pain up my forearm with each toss and catch. By the 13K turnaround on Lake Shore, I had entered survival mode. \\"We're going to finish this,\\" Zach said. \\"My flight doesn't leave until tomorrow.\\"Close to my break point at about 15K, the race film crew showed up. Wonderful, I thought. Everyone can watch me fall apart. And they did. As I inched forward a few steps at a time, the camera crew remained. I thought about all the people who had donated to SickKids Foundation, I thought about the sick kids, and I thought about how lucky I was to be out there doing this.The commentary on the race video is priceless. Canadian Running editor-in-chief Michael Doyle says it looks like a slow form of torture, and he was right!Things were not going well at all.I thought I could justmyself through the rest of the race, even if it took 15 or 20 hours. But just before the 17K marker, I knew my hand was too damaged to go on. I got the five-ball pattern going, joggled to the 17K sign, caught the balls, turned to Zach behind me, and declared, \\"Joggler out.\\" At this point, we were in last place in the entire race of 18,000 people, followed by a line of police cars.Zach said we should continue to run the rest of the marathon without juggling, and I agreed, though I secretly planned to bail at the half. A couple of kilometres later, we ran past three mounted police officers. Zach ran over to them and, employing his deft social skills from a decade of living and working in Afghanistan, he convinced them to gallop behind me on a final joggle. It was quite the scene. I ended up joggling at a good clip, as the clack of the hooves sounded altogether too close behind me.We continued on. Near the halfway point, we ran into my parents, my sister, Moira, and my niece, Kate. My mom reminded us that the course had a time limit of 6 hours. \\"A sub-2 half? We can do that!\\" Zach said, cheerfully. I put on my best smiley face, and off we went for another half marathon. We shared some good laughs with the walkers, and were ever grateful for the volunteers who remained at the scene to offer Gatorade and water to last runners and walkers. My entire body felt like it was falling apart, but somehow I found the strength to keep running. Zach hadn't run a marathon since our 2007 joggling duel in Salt Lake, and recently had back surgery, so he wasn't doing so well himself. But we chatted and laughed and joked our way through the rest of it.I juggled for the last few metres across the finish line. Two of my beanbags hit the timing clock above the finish and thumped to the ground on the finish line. Seemed appropriate that these extra two balls fell at the end.Joggling five balls every step of the way over long distances is very hard. Ludicrous, really. I knew this challenge had a good chance of failure. But I emerged from the experience with an odd sense of excitement. I tried. I gave it everything. I juggled to the last catch possible.I had the privilege of running with Zach Warren for 5 hours and 40 minutes, a great way to catch up with a friend after 10 years. I got to see my wife Dianne and kids, Annika and Lauryn at the end. Lots of people donated to SickKids, raising nearly 2,000. Zach and I posted a negative split of, possibly the largest negative split ever in a marathon. I joggled five balls of the race for 17K, which is likely the furthest anyone has gone for every step, returning behind the drop point after each drop. Zach and I had a chance to experience what it's like to be in last place in an IAAF Gold Label marathon. We met so many amazing people along the route. I got to joggle with a mounted police escort.There was some pretty entertaining media coverage after the race, from Canadian Running Sky Sports , and the Toronto Star . The Twitter Moment for it was even shared around the world by Twitter Moments and Twitter Sports.As joggler Bob Evans said to me on Facebook after the race, \\"There is no story without conflict. Your 5-ball marathon quest just got a lot more compelling. Keep going!\\" In this case, I battled the record, and the record won. This was captured perfectly in this screenshot of race video of me looking like a dejected gorilla.Joggler out, but not down. ||||| I'm Michal \\"The Joggler\\" Kapral of Toronto, Canada, and I run marathons while \\"joggling,\\" which is an actual sport that combines jogging and juggling.

Movie title: Ben and Me Movie plot: The film begins with a tour group in the present day, but quickly moves to the 16th century. Quickly tracing a mouse family's history in England, we see how the family was forced to go to America due to an excess of cats.In America, the film then focuses on Amos, a 1740s mouse living in a Philadelphia church. His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing. Amos insists that Franklin read his own agreement out loud at that moment and its wording inspires Jefferson to create an appropriate opening to his own piece.The movie ends with a return to the tour group in the present.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. NCAA Votes To Allow Power Schools To Make Rules, Pay Players Stipends Some colleges are going to pay athletes. The NCAA voted Thursday to allow 65 teams from the so-called Big 5 power conferences—the ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC, plus Notre Dame, a football independent that is now a member of the ACC in other sports—to make their own rules. These conferences will to offer their athletes not only a scholarship, but the full cost of attendance: money for extras like food, clothing, the occasional trip to the movie theater and more. Depending on the school, this could amount to athletes receiving an additional 2,000 to 5,000. With further autonomy, these schools will also ease restrictions on contact between athletes and agents, and be able to do things like pay for post-season travel for the families of athletes and invest more money in athletic health care coverage. The move in many ways reflects an economic reality. These conferences drive the most interest in college sports: Between 2003 and 2012, for example, annual football revenues for teams now in SEC jumped 91%, to 759.9 million. The college football playoff, which starts this season, and the continuing expansion of lucrative conference television networks—the SEC Network debuts on August 14—will continue to pump more riches into college sports. NCAA leaders are recognizing that in this environment, the long-criticized inequity of college sports—that none of this additional money flows into the pockets of the talent actually doing the core work, the athletes—is no longer tenable. “It’s important for the student-athletes and their welfare,” Ken Starr, president and chancellor of Baylor University, said of the vote. “There are things that we would like to do, and we need to be empowered to do those things.” While the vote is historic in nature, college sports critics contend it doesn’t go far enough. “I hope it’s the first step towards players being able to negotiate their own working conditions,” said Richard Southhall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. “The crumbs are more nutritious than they used to be, but they’re still crumbs.” The move falls short of giving athletes in the high-revenue sports full salaries, or allowing them to capture their true worth on the open market. To college leaders, such reform would dredge up the dreaded E-word. Athletes would serve as employees, which administrators have determined is incompatible with education. “If you’re an athlete, going from 0 to 3,500, mathematically, is infinitely better,” said Andy Schwarz, an economist who has done work on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Ed O’Bannon anti-trust case, in which the former UCLA hoops star and other athletes are challenging the rights of schools to profit off their name, image and likeness without compensating them. “But qualitatively, it still misses the point entirely.” A decision in the O’Bannon case, which is pending, and a successful effort by Northwestern football players to form a union could accelerate the destruction of the NCAA’s so-called “amateurism” model. But for other critics of the NCAA’s vote, that would be a disaster. To them, autonomy for Big 5 conferences, and cost of attendance subsidies, already goes too far. It will destroy competitive balance in college sports, as the extra benefits offered by the big schools will allow them to attract even more top talent, leaving schools outside these conferences helpless. “The NCAA cannot fall prey to phony arguments about student welfare when the real goal of some of these so-called reformers is create a plutocracy,” Boise State president Bob Kustra wrote in statement in May, “that serves no useful purpose in American higher education.” Stipends for athletes, however, won’t destroy college sports. Competitive balance doesn’t really exist in college sports now, as almost all of the top high school players are already going to the top schools. In a 2011 paper entitled “Excuses, Not Reasons: 13 Myths About (Not) Paying College Athletes,” Schwarz studied 10 years worth of recruiting data and found that 99% of the high school football players listed as Top 100 prospects on Rivals.com went to power conference schools and Notre Dame. And despite this trend, football teams like Northern Illinois, and basketball teams like Wichita St., have cracked the top of the national rankings, because, as West Virginia athletic director Oliver Luck puts it, “recruiting is an art, not a science.” Plenty of talented players are overlooked by big schools, and will continue to be overlooked by big schools, even though players at top conferences are receiving a few thousands dollars extra in stipends. At lower schools, plenty of players blossom into pros, and will continue to blossom into pros, even though their Big 5 rivals are receiving some cash. Sure, a few players on the margin may choose to possibly sit on the bench at a big conference school, rather than star at the lower levels, because of the extra benefits. But all talent won’t flow upwards, because of simple supply and demand. Schools offer a finite amount of athletic scholarships; every player who wants to play basketball at Duke can’t go to Duke. So they’ll go to, say, Lehigh. And what can happen? We’ll still have charming upsets. If Lehigh could knock off the hyped stars from Duke during the 2011 NCAA tournament, they could still beat them tomorrow, even if the Duke players receive more money. “Having a little bit of cash doesn’t spoil the entire amateur status,” Luck said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The NCAA has decided that some big colleges can make their own rules and give their athletes extra money. This means college athletes can get money for things like food, clothes, and fun activities, maybe between 2,000 to 5,000 more. The famous college sports conferences, like ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC, can do this because they make a lot of money from sports. Some people think this is a good step, but others feel it's not enough or that it could cause problems. However, college sports should still be fun, interesting, and have surprising results even with these changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person Russell was the biographer for?, using the article: Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \\"1949 Head\\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question is \\"John\\". The person Russell was the biographer for is Francis Bacon, and the first name of the person is not mentioned in the article. However, John Russell is mentioned as Bacon's biographer, so it can be inferred that the friend was asking for the first name of the biographer and not the subject.

Given the below context:  The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008):  Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\"  Guess a valid title for it!

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Review: Every writer tries to manipulate his readers: he programs a response in them with the words he writes. Murakami in this book simply toyed with the readers, playing one trick on them after another. He wrote, four no maybe, five different books and cut them apart and patched different pieces of them together in a rather random order. They were all pointless, especially the main Toru Okada thread, and they generally were not pleasant reading. Maybe I feel like the first patron to buy Picasso's first abstract painting, and Picasso went on to become a recognized artist. But this first patron may have never changed his mind that what Picasso sold him was a piece of junk, and the rest of the world is a bit crazy not to have noticed. Answer: A:","output":"The tone of the product review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the book, stating that the author manipulated the readers in an unpleasant way. They go on to mention that the different stories in the book are randomly put together, making them feel pointless. In addition, the reviewer compares their experience to that of someone who buys a piece of art that is regarded as junk, implying that their perception of the book is negative. Furthermore, the title \\"I feel I've been manipulated\\" foreshadows a negative outlook, as it communicates the reviewer's negative experience and feelings towards the book. The comparison to Picasso's first patron also suggests that the reviewer has a strong negative opinion of the book because, like the patron who never changed his mind regarding Picasso's work, the reviewer implies that they are unlikely to change their negative view of the book. Overall, the review is critical and focuses on the negative aspects of the book, making it clear that the tone is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Gulf War, commander, George H. W. Bush. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The Gulf War was a significant military operation that took place between August 2, 1990 and February 28, 1991 in the Middle East, primarily in Iraq and Kuwait. This conflict is sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Shield, which was the initial defensive response to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, and Operation Desert Storm, which was the offensive operation led by the United States and a coalition of international forces to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. At the helm of this strategic military campaign was the commander, then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, tensions between Iraq and Kuwait had escalated due to various economic and political factors, including border disputes and disagreements related to oil production. The Iraqi President at the time, Saddam Hussein, accused Kuwait of overproducing oil, which contributed to a decline in oil prices and, consequently, negatively impacted the Iraqi economy. In need of financial resources, Iraq invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The international community swiftly condemned this act of aggression, and the United Nations Security Council passed numerous resolutions demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. In response to this crisis, U.S. President George H. W. Bush spearheaded diplomatic efforts to assemble a multinational coalition of forces to counter the Iraqi aggression and ultimately liberate Kuwait. This coalition consisted of more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other nations from across the Middle East and Europe. As the commander of the coalition's military efforts, George H. W. Bush initiated Operation Desert Shield, which focused on the deployment of a significant number of U.S. and international troops, as well as naval, air, and ground forces, to the Arabian Peninsula. The main objective of this operation was to create a deterrent to prevent further Iraqi aggression and protect key regional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, from potential attacks. During this period, Bush, his administration, and military leaders worked tirelessly to drum up international support for their cause and carefully plan the military operations that would ensue. After several months of preparatory operations, diplomatic negotiations, and an international economic embargo against Iraq, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm on January 17, 1991. This offensive operation included a large-scale air campaign, which targeted Iraqi military infrastructure, as well as its command and control systems. The ultimate goal was to weaken Saddam Hussein's regime and force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Following weeks of sustained aerial bombardment, coalition ground forces began a rapid and decisive ground campaign that took advantage of the weakened Iraqi military's lack of coordinated defense. As a result, the coalition successfully liberated Kuwait on February 28, 1991. In total, the war resulted in a low number of U.S. and coalition casualties compared to the substantial losses experienced by Iraq's military and civilian populations. In conclusion, the Gulf War was a pivotal moment in modern military history as it showcased the ability of a large coalition of countries to act in unison against a common aggressor. Under the firm leadership of George H. W. Bush, the coalition forces successfully conducted a well-planned and executed military campaign that achieved their objectives. The rapid and decisive victory not only liberated Kuwait but also reinforced the credibility of the United Nations and the international community's commitment to upholding the principles of global peace and security."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"He added, \\"Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What came as an expense of live singing?\\"","output":"While the given answer provides an insight into the evolution of live performances by mentioning artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson, it does not explicitly address the expense of live singing. A more comprehensive and detailed answer would be as follows: The expense of live singing can be attributed to multiple factors arising from the increasingly complex and high-quality production values that have become an essential part of modern live performances. These factors may include enhanced visual and audio elements, highly athletic dancing, and the use of advanced technology, all of which have the potential to impact the quality of live singing. One of the most significant expenses of live singing comes from the elaborate stage productions that have become a norm in the entertainment industry. Shows by iconic artists like Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson have set new standards for showmanship. These concerts showcase breathtaking visual elements, such as intricate stage designs, elaborate costumes, and precision-timed pyrotechnics, which, while stunning, can potentially affect live performances due to their complexity and requirement of extensive preparation and rehearsals. Furthermore, live performances have evolved to incorporate highly athletic dancing routines. As artists' dedication to delivering visually spectacular performances has grown, the intricate and intense choreography has become a staple of many modern live concerts. This heightened emphasis on dance can lead to artists lip-syncing as they execute these physically demanding routines, as it becomes challenging to maintain a high standard of vocal performance while also delivering flawless dance moves. This trade-off comes at the expense of live singing, a fact that some fans may find disappointing. Additionally, the increasing use of technology in live performances brings both significant benefits and challenges. On the one hand, advanced audio systems, lighting, and special effects can enhance the overall experience for the audience, creating a memorable event. On the other hand, the reliance on technology can also hinder live singing. The use of pre-recorded tracks, vocal effects, and auto-tune may impair the purity and authenticity of the artist's live vocal performance, leading to debates on the ethics of such practices in live performances. In conclusion, the expense of live singing can be attributed to several factors, such as elaborate stage productions, highly athletic dancing, and the use of technology. While these developments contribute to creating visually stunning and memorable live performances, they can also detract from the authenticity and quality of live singing, as artists may opt to lip-sync or use technological aids to maintain a seamless performance in the face of increasing physical and logistical demands on stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When did the CAA begin to exptend it's ATC responsibilities?

The Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) was created in 1938 through the Civil Aeronautics Act. This organization was initially responsible for regulating various aspects of civil aviation in the United States, including air traffic control, safety regulations, and economic oversight. Over the years, as the aviation industry grew and evolved, the CAA underwent transformations and expanded its responsibilities in response to emerging challenges and technological advancements. The CAA initially began extending its ATC responsibilities following World War II, as there was a significant increase in commercial air transportation during the postwar years. In response to the growing demand for air transportation, the CAA began gradually implementing new changes and improvements. Multiple factors contributed to the CAA's expansion of ATC responsibilities, including legislation, technological advancements, and operational events that highlighted the need for enhanced air traffic control systems. In 1946, President Truman signed the Federal Airport Act, which provided federal funding for the development of the National Airport System and led to improvements in air traffic control infrastructure throughout the country. This act meant that the CAA played a more significant role in the development and management of civilian airports, which in turn required expansions in their ATC responsibilities. The introduction of radar systems for air traffic control purposes in the late 1940s and early 1950s was a critical technological advancement that enabled the CAA to keep up with the expanding air transportation industry. It allowed controllers to better manage airspace and monitor aircraft position and speed. This technology provided them with better tools for managing air traffic, ultimately enhancing safety and efficiency throughout the system. During the 1950s and 1960s, several high-profile midair collisions between commercial aircraft prompted further expansions of ATC capabilities and responsibilities. These tragic events highlighted the need for stricter coordination and control of airspace. In response to these incidents, the CAA implemented various upgrades and improvements, including the establishment of new Air Route Traffic Control Centers and the modernization of radar technology to achieve better coverage. In 1958, the Federal Aviation Act was passed which resulted in the formation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), replacing the CAA as the primary government organization responsible for regulating and advancing civil aviation within the United States. Under the FAA, the ATC system continued to grow and evolve in response to industry needs and emerging technologies, such as automation and satellite-based navigation systems. In summary, the CAA began extending its ATC responsibilities following World War II to better cope with the postwar boom in commercial air transportation and enhance safety throughout the industry. The CAA's commitment to expanding its role in ATC was influenced by factors such as relevant legislation, technological advancements such as radar, and operational events prompting improvements within the system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To call \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\" amateurish is to overstate the obvious. If you aren't a fan of low budget drive-in films, you probably wouldn't be looking here in the first place. The problem with the movie is that when there's no monster action going on, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in that it's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing is too outlandish for \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\". It explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into Crater Lake, 'superheating' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable, wouldn't \\"superheating\\" the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate? Other than some token fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence of the water being hot, other than a few lines in the script. The script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences, and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino. A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake. Hmmmm...do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity? In a sequence that's just plain bizarre, a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze. A car chase ensues, and wouldn't ya know it...they end up right by the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yeah, it's not hard to figure out, and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. The shamelessness of it all is endearing, and I really want to like \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\". I just can't do it. There's not enough here to go on, and this is more of a movie to put on during a party, because you could talk right over it and it wouldn't matter.  The film has a slim list of the things going for it, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water, and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good. There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it, and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie. A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it.

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim spoke to reporters recently to discuss the effects of the Ebola spread. \\"Our findings show that if the virus  continues to spread, the economic cost to these countries could grow eight times by 2015. This would be a big _ to their already weak economies,\\" said Kim. Mr. Kim says, \\"saving lives and preventing new spread\\" is most important. The bank has given 117-million for an \\"immediate help.\\" The World Bank President says the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004 showed how a disease could damage economies. 800 people died from SARS and the economic losses were up to 40-billion. Mr. Kim says SARS and the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 taught that fear and avoidance resulted in about 90-percent of the economic losses. That means the disease is causing two levels of economic damage. \\"There are two kinds of contagion . One is connected with the virus itself and the second is connected with the spread of fear about the virus,\\" said Kim. The World Bank thinks the losses to the economies of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be big .Mr. Kim says losses could be about 97-million at the moment. Mr. Kim says fast action is necessary. He says getting the disease under control is still far away. That is because there are not enough health care workers in the affected areas.

Available choices: -- a cold person; -- a nice person; -- a mean person; Answer:","output":"Given the context provided, Aubrey can be described as a nice person. This is based on the action of leaning towards Lee to give them a kiss, which demonstrates warmth, affection, and a certain level of intimacy. It is important to note that a single action may not be enough to judge a person's entire character, but in this specific scenario, Aubrey appears to be expressing kindness and care for Lee. A nice person generally exhibits positive attributes, such as friendliness, warmth, empathy, and understanding towards others. They tend to treat others with respect and often display a genuine concern for their well-being. While this particular situation may not encompass the entire range of characteristics that define a nice person, it does provide an indication that Aubrey is exhibiting some of these qualities towards Lee. It is worth mentioning that there could be different aspects to Aubrey's character which may not be completely evident in this brief interaction. People are multifaceted, and a single act, even if it points to a positive characteristic, does not conclusively portray a person's overall nature.

Information:  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - Stephan Groth ( born August 10 , 1971 in Odense , Denmark ) is the man behind Apoptygma Berzerk , an electronic body music act that plays in styles such as synthpop , ebm , and futurepop . Stephan Leonard Groth was born in Odense , Denmark but relocated with his family to his father 's home town Sarpsborg , Norway in 1986 . Along with Ronan Harris of VNV Nation and the members of Covenant , he is considered by many to be one of the pioneers of the futurepop genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s . Groth is also a member of Fairlight Children , which is a lighter , more pop - oriented electronic act . Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo .  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\"  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of \\"Shallow Nation\\", the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, \\"Serenity is the Devil\\", was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member.  - Unheilig (German for \\"Unholy\\") is a German band that features a variety of influences including various pop and electronic styles as well as harder, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in 1999 and principally consists of singer Bernd Heinrich \\"Der Graf\\" Graf along with various musical partners. He has been accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \\"Licky\\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \\"Potti\\" Potthoff. The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg.  - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named \\"Tybalt\\" is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\".  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\".  - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805  4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality.  - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\". Apoptygma Berzerk has over 30 releases and won awards and Top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia.

It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.

Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels, believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of Iona, off the western coast of Scotland. Telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. In hopes of recovering a lost artefact. The films true beauty lies in its' animation. Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity. Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series 'Samurai Jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth, The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion. The history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is, as she glides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. The Secret of Kels is an absolute treat.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations. Established in 1995, the main goal of the WTO is to ensure that trade flows smoothly, predictably, and freely across the globe. This is achieved by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and settling disputes among its member states. The organization has several key aspects it needs to function effectively. Some of these include: 1. Trade negotiations: The WTO provides a platform for member states to engage in negotiations, aiming to reduce barriers to trade and promote a fair trading environment. These negotiations lead to new or revised international trade agreements. 2. Dispute resolution: WTO has a mechanism that allows member states to settle disputes related to trade policies and practices. The Dispute Settlement Body ensures that disputes are resolved in a timely and fair manner, making sure that member states adhere to the agreements they have entered. 3. Monitoring and review of trade policies: The WTO keeps track of the trade policies and practices of its member states. This is done through various mechanisms, including Trade Policy Reviews, which help ensure transparency and evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. 4. Capacity building and technical assistance: The WTO offers various programs to help its member states, particularly developing and least-developed countries, build their capacity to engage in international trade. These programs include technical assistance, training, and support for implementing WTO agreements. Overall, the members of the WTO recognize the potential benefits that the organization can bring to the table, which is why they have reached an agreement about its ability and necessity to function effectively. By working together and supporting the organization's goals, members can ensure a more equitable, transparent, and collaborative international trading system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Shrek Forever After Movie plot: Shrek has grown steadily tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to yearn for the days when he felt like a \\"real ogre\\". When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\". They soon encounter a band of ogres who are resisting Stiltskin. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Stiltskin. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of...

It whetted my appetite for more. \\"Whispers of Moonlight,\\" however, was a disappointment. After a while, the story seemed so circular, and it made for very frustrating reading.

It's almost a cross between a philosophy and a history, but written in a light/easy to read way. Most books on business tend to be detailed, technical, or boring--this book tells business as if it were a story. (Which it is)Very few business books are written in this style and by doing so he captures some of the feelings and passion of business along with a few strategic concepts. Business comes from the heart as well as the head and I appreciate the way this book combines both aspects.On the other hand, I had some reservation giving 5 stars. While he extensively chronicles his own business--there are few/no references to other businesses and/or collaborating evidence. Still, I would recommend this book to any budding businessperson--but I'd also recommend reading from other authors (I recommend Peter Drucker) to gain a wider perspective.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"Who could be called the first Chinese inventor?\\" Answer: \\"Peking man\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. The first Chinese inventor could be called \\"Peking Man\\" because he learned how to capture and maintain fire, which was a significant breakthrough in technology and society at that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To understand why this conclusion can be drawn, we can break down the statement and analyze its components: 1. The oldest section of Havana is described as the city's most spectacular.  2. Restoration work and gleaming coats of pastel colonial colors, as well as a stern police presence, contribute to a slightly more sanitized feel in parts of the oldest section. 3. The weathered working-class neighborhoods that extend along the water and inland are mentioned, which implies a comparison with the oldest section of Havana. Based on these points, we can deduce the following: A. The oldest section's spectacular nature sets it apart from other areas in the city. B. The spectacular nature of the oldest section is a result of its restoration works, pastel colonial colors, and the overall ambiance, making it distinct from other sections such as weathered working-class neighborhoods.

Title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

Bozz has no desire to go to war and acts like it. Even though his weekend leave is withdrawn he still goes to town and ends up going to a hotel room with two girls and fellow soldier Paxton (Matthew Davis). Bozz and Paxton make friends despite their different outlooks; Paxton has enlisted for service and wants to go to Nam for the experience.At the base, while Bozz shows that he is capable of being a good soldier when he wants to, he continues to attract disciplinary penalties as well as the anger of fellow privates, especially one named Wilson (Shea Whigham).

Please answer this question: What is the two-word term used for a tennis match where the final score is 6-0,6-0?","output":"The two-word term used for a tennis match where the final score is 6-0, 6-0 is called a \\"double bagel.\\" This term is derived from the shape of a bagel, which represents the number \\"0\\" because of its round shape with a hole in the center. A \\"double bagel\\" scoreline signifies a completely dominant performance by one player, who manages to win two sets without conceding a single game to their opponent.  In professional tennis, such a result is relatively rare, as the skill level of players at this level is usually well-matched and extremely competitive. However, when a double bagel does occur, it usually indicates that one player was in exceptional form or their opponent failed to find their rhythm or struggled with various issues, possibly even including injury. While 6-0, 6-0 is a definitive victory for the winning player, they typically gain no extra advantage in terms of tournament rankings or prize money beyond what they would receive for any other victory at that stage of the competition. However, it certainly boosts their confidence, as well as earning them a place in the tennis history books for outstanding performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Deciding between following your passion and adhering to your parent's wishes can be challenging, especially when you are 19 and at a critical juncture in your life. In your case, the passion you have is joining the Army Reserves, which is supported by your mom but opposed by your dad. It is essential to consider various aspects before making a well-informed decision. Here are some factors that you might want to consider: 1. Personal Fulfillment: Assess your motivations for wanting to join the Army Reserves. Why do you feel passionate about this path, and how much personal fulfillment do you anticipate it will bring you? Personal satisfaction is vital for maintaining a long-term commitment to any profession. 2. Career Prospects: It is essential to consider the career prospects offered by the Army Reserves. How will joining the reserves impact your education, employment opportunities, and potential for advancement? Are there alternative routes to achieving your goals that might be more beneficial for your future? 3. Emotional and Mental Well-being: The emotional and mental well-being of individuals is significantly affected by their chosen career paths. The military can be both physically and emotionally challenging. Do you believe you are ready to handle the emotional and mental rigors of military service? 4. Family Dynamics: Consider your parental relationship and the role your parents play in your decision-making. Are both of your parents' opinions equally important to you, or do you feel more inclined to follow one parent's advice over the other? It is essential to maintain a healthy relationship and communication with both parents, irrespective of what decision you make. 5. Financial Considerations: Joining the military can have implications on your financial stability. The benefits, apart from salary, could include educational assistance, healthcare, and housing allowance. However, it's important to compare these benefits with potential earnings in another field that aligns with your passion. Now, moving on to your question whether both questions have the same meaning or not. While they may not have precisely the same meaning, they interlink with each other substantially. The first question is a general query about whether to follow one's passion or to do what one's parents say. In contrast, the second question provides a context (joining the Army Reserves) for the dilemma. Both questions are based on making a choice between personal desires and parental guidance.  In conclusion, examine each consideration carefully, gather as much information as you can, and engage in open and honest discussions with your parents about your desires and concerns. Reflect on what you genuinely feel is the best course of action for you, ensuring that you feel confident making your decision based on your passions, family dynamics, and future prospects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the news arrived at Paris of the surrender at Sedan of Napoleon III and 80,000 men, the Second Empire was overthrown by a popular uprising in Paris, which forced the proclamation of a Provisional Government and a Third Republic by general Trochu, Favre and Gambetta at Paris on 4 September, the new government calling itself the Government of National Defence.

They have mostly performed as a trio, as well as a quartet with two drummers in recent years. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover have been constant members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. \\"Melvin\\" was despised by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

The Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane felt that the group's \\"quirky, irreverent, acoustic-based sound was at odds with the usual guitar-heavy, grunge trends of the day. The band's presentation had a tweeness about it that could have been off-putting if not for its genuine freshness and honesty\\".  - Chapel Hill is a city in Orange County, North Carolina (with some eastern portions in Durham County), and the home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care.

Context: This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: What does the investigative journalist group ProPublica think about separating children from their parents? Options: - It disagrees with the policy - It is not interested in the policy - not enough information - It agrees with the policy Answer:","output":"Not enough information"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Cathy Phillips   It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park. I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year. JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research. Enron's goal this year is to raise  225,000 and we need your help. Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place! We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal. The theme for the  walk this year is \\"Knock Out Diabetes\\" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose marriage to a taxi driver is on the rocks?, using the article: Gloria, a downtrodden housewife, lives with her husband Antonio, mother-in-law and two sons in a small, shabby and overcrowded  apartment located by the Madrid motorway. Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin. The grandmother, who is addicted to soft drinks, shares the same dream of returning to her native village. Gloria's friends are her two neighbors: Cristal and Juani. Cristal is a prostitute with a heart of gold. Juani, is a bitter woman obsessed with cleanliness and vulgar ornaments, her daughter, Vanesa, has  telekinetic powers, which she uses to destroy their apartment., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Whose marriage to a taxi driver is on the rocks?\\" as per the provided article, is Gloria.  Gloria is depicted as a hardworking woman who has to juggle between her roles as a wife, mother, caretaker, and a cleaning lady. Her life is overwhelming as she lives in a crowded and substandard apartment located by the Madrid motorway, along with her mother-in-law, two sons, and her husband Antonio. To manage her demanding life, Gloria resorts to using amphetamines. Antonio, Gloria's husband, is described as a male chauvinist who works as a taxi driver. Their marital relationship is unstable and strained, and consequently, their marriage is on the rocks. The instability mentioned can partly be attributed to Antonio's past affair that seems to linger and affect their marriage. Antonio had a brief relationship, fifteen years earlier in Germany, with Ingrid Muller, a German singer for whom he had worked as a driver. This infidelity's remnants, including a signed photograph of Ingrid and a song of hers that Antonio keeps playing, seem to irritate Gloria, further contributing to the tension between them.  Additionally, Antonio seems to be occupied with a sinister plot to forge Hitler's diaries for profit along with Lucas, a writer he met during his taxi duties. This venture and Antonio's attempts to tutor one of their sons in forgery don't paint a positive image of him and could be causing further strain on their relationship. From the article, Gloria's life can be seen as chaotic and stressful with various dramatic elements surrounding her family and herself. Given this situation, her unstable marriage to Antonio, the taxi driver, is evidently rocky. She has to endure her husband's chauvinistic attitudes, memories of his past affair, and his dubious activities, all while managing the household and working as a cleaning lady to support the family. Hence, the answer to your friend's question is Gloria."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Not every shot in cricket can be a scoring shot. When a ball is well bowled, use a forward defensive shot to avoid being called out. Having a solid defense is a crucial part of being a good batsman.  Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Take a step with the front foot while keeping the back leg straight.  Swing the bat downward and contact the ball as it passes below the eyes. Keep the bat angled so the face is toward the ground. The bat should end up slightly ahead of your front leg and close the side of the pad. Do not follow through. Keep the heel of your back foot off the ground and hold the position to have the best chance to block the ball. This shot is usually played when a full delivery on middle or off stump. It is one of the most common shots and usually the first one learned by cricket players. Depending on the direction the ball travels, this shot can be referred to as a cover drive, off drive, straight drive, on drive, or square drive.  Lean forward and step with your front foot. Bend your front knee. This will give you a solid base for the shot. Your head should ahead or level with the front knee and your back foot should be up on the toe during the swing. Swing the bat straight and contact the ball when it is below the eyes. Keep your wrists relaxed and the bat angled to keep the drive low. Follow through should continue on a straight path so that the bat face is toward the sky. This shot is great to use against spinners. When you see a low-bouncing ball on the legside, go to the sweep shot.  Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Stride with your front foot so the pad is in the path of the ball. Drop your back knee to the ground. Lift the bat to a high backswing then bring the bat down and across the body. Strike the ball in front of the pad. Roll your wrists slightly when you make contact to angle the ball downward. Follow through. Bring your hands around after striking the ball so they end up near your front shoulder with the bat held high in the air. This shot relies on the speed of the bowled ball as opposed to the power of the hitter. A front foot leg glance is best used to play balls delivered off to the leg side.  Lean forward with your head and front shoulder. Shift your weight to your front leg. Bring the bat straight through. Angle the bat face slightly toward your front leg during the stroke. Make contact in front of the front leg pad. Flick your top wrist to glance the shot downward. This shot relies on control and precision to deflect the ball as opposed to a powerful swing. Summary:","output":"In cricket, using various shots like the forward defensive shot, cover drive, sweep shot, and front foot leg glance helps in scoring and blocking, depending on the ball situation, making good defense an important skill for a batsman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"After thoroughly researching the information related to the 2012 Rose Bowl Game, I am providing the following revised answer. To answer the initial question, the Rose Bowl Game of 2012 took place on January 2, 2012. Regarding the suggested answer, it is not entirely accurate. The 2012 Rose Bowl Game was indeed a historic event, but not because it was the first time a team from a non-Automatic Qualifying Conference played and won the Rose Bowl. In fact, the two teams that participated in that game were the University of Oregon Ducks (Pac-12 Conference) and the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Big Ten Conference), both of which belong to Automatic Qualifying Conferences. The Oregon Ducks emerged as the champions with a score of 45-38. The confusion in the suggested answer could be due to the fact that it is referring to the 2007 Fiesta Bowl between Boise State (a non-AQ Conference team) and Oklahoma, in which Boise State won in a memorable overtime victory. This, however, is not related to the 2012 Rose Bowl Game. Therefore, you should not validate the suggested answer as it contains significant inaccuracies. Here is a revised response: The 2012 Rose Bowl Game took place on January 2, 2012, featuring the University of Oregon Ducks (Pac-12 Conference) and the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Big Ten Conference). The University of Oregon Ducks were victorious with a final score of 45-38 in this historic bowl game. However, the suggested answer regarding a non-Automatic Qualifying Conference team playing and winning the Rose Bowl for the first time in its 97-year history is inaccurate and should not be validated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: In1934heprovedaspecialcaseofhisconjecturenamelythataxistranscendentalifaisalgebraic(a0,1)andxisanirrationalalgebraicnumber.","output":"In 1934, he proved a special case of his conjecture, namely that a number in the form of \\"ax\\" is transcendental if \\"a\\" is an algebraic number (distinct from 0 and 1) and \\"x\\" is an irrational algebraic number. To better understand this statement, let's break it down further: 1. A transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. In other words, transcendental numbers cannot be expressed as the solution to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients. Examples of transcendental numbers include π (pi) and e. 2. Algebraic numbers, on the other hand, are the root of some non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The simplest examples of algebraic numbers are the integers and rational numbers, but many irrational numbers are also algebraic, such as the square root of 2. 3. An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. It has a non-terminating and non-repeating decimal representation. Well-known irrational numbers include the square root of 2 and the golden ratio. So, the mentioned conjecture states that if you have a number \\"a\\" which is distinct from 0 and 1, and is algebraic, and you have an irrational algebraic number \\"x\\", then the product \\"ax\\" will be transcendental. In 1934, this special case of the conjecture was proven, making it an important milestone in the study of transcendental numbers and the relationship between algebraic and transcendental elements within the realm of mathematics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: oodbye now. Putting off going to visit a loved one in the hospital is always a mistake, as is waiting until the last days before a friend leaves the country forever. Don't miss out on your chance to say goodbye and brighten their final moments. Alone in the hospital can be a terrible place to die. Be in the room and say what needs to be said. Spend as much time with your loved one as possible. Be with him or her and support them. Often, the dying want and are very comforted by one of four very particular messages: \\"I love you,\\" \\"I forgive you,\\" \\"Please forgive me,\\" or \\"Thank you.\\" If any of these seem appropriate, take care to include them in your goodbye. We often have the impression that death or other \\"forever\\" goodbyes are supposed to be a somber and joyless thing. But follow the lead of the person leaving. Your role is to be there for them and to comfort them in a time of need. If laughter is desired, or seems natural, then laugh. It can be hard to know how honest to be with the dying. If you're visiting an ex-spouse or an estranged sibling, there can be lots of tension burbling under the surface, and complicated emotions at work in their passing. The hospital doesn't seem like the best time to let loose and tell off your father for being absent.  If you feel like the truth will hurt the person dying, recognize this and change the subject. Say, \\"You don't need to worry about me today\\" and change the subject. It can be tempting to want to be overly optimistic, saying \\"No, there's still a chance. Don't give up\\" if a loved one says, \\"I'm dying.\\" There's no need to dwell on something neither of you know for sure. Change the subject to, \\"How are you feeling today?\\" or reassure them by saying, \\"You look great today.\\" Always speak gently and identify yourself as the person speaking. Even if you're not sure you're being heard, say what needs to be said. The goodbye process in death works both ways--make sure you don't regret not saying \\"I love you\\" one last time. Even if you're unsure if the person can hear you, say it, and you'll know. Both physically and emotionally, be in the room. It can be difficult to avoid becoming hyperaware of the significance of the moment: \\"Is that the last time he'll say, 'I love you'?\\" Every moment can feel tense and electric. But get out of your own way and try, as much as possible, to experience the moments for what they are: time with a loved one. Often, the dying have a great amount of control over the actual moment of their death and will wait until they're alone to save their loved ones the pain of experiencing it. Likewise, many family members are committed to being there, \\"To the end.\\" Be aware of this and try not to put too much emphasis on the exact moment of death. Say goodbye when it seems appropriate. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of not postponing visits to loved ones in the hospital and highlights the value of expressing love, forgiveness, and gratitude during those final moments. It also encourages providing emotional support, adapting to the departing person's emotional state, and not focusing on the exact moment of death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Nazarbayev Looks to Have Won Re-Election as Kazakhstan President SEMEY, Kazakhstan — This spring’s hasty campaign season in Kazakhstan has sometimes felt like a pep rally for Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the steelworker-turned-Communist-Party-boss who has ruled the country since 1989. That impression was heightened on Sunday when one of the president’s three challengers acknowledged that he, too, had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev. “I am sure that the current president will be the victor, so I am giving him my vote as well,” the challenger, Mels Yeleusizov, an environmental activist, told the Interfax news service as he emerged from a polling station in the city of Almaty. He said his family was voting for Mr. Nazarbayev as well. The president, who called snap elections two years ahead of schedule, won by 94.8 percent, according to an exit poll by the Association of Sociologists and Political Scientists of Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, early results from the Central Election Committee suggested that turnout was an extraordinarily high 89.9 percent, despite opposition leaders who denounced the election as a farce and encouraged voters to stay home. Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, is credited with making oil-rich Kazakhstan into Central Asia’s island of stability, but he has drawn criticism from the West for stifling dissent. In February, seeking to shore up his reputation as an international statesman, Mr. Nazarbayev abruptly rejected the idea of a referendum that would have granted him the presidency until 2020. The election provided an even playing field, he told reporters on Sunday. “All candidates had equal opportunities to visit regions and had access to mass media,” Mr. Nazarbayev said on Sunday, as he emerged from the country’s National Academic Library, a grandiose new structure that is shaped like a Möbius strip. “They expressed their ideas and unveiled their messages to the people of Kazakhstan. There are some valuable thoughts that we have to keep in mind. We are open to our society.” In Semey, a university city near the border with Siberia, students showed up in large numbers in a snowstorm on Sunday morning, and poll workers said there were already lines when they opened the doors at 7 a.m. Tolebay K. Rakhypbekov, rector of the Semey State Medical University, said political competition would come to Kazakhstan — but only gradually. “There is none now,” he said. “But what competition can there be against our president? We all love him.” Lyudmila A. Lyapunova, 60, said voters were there because they risked losing their jobs or university spots if they did not show up. As a retiree, she said, she could afford to openly denounce the process, and planned to cross out every name on the ballot: an improvised version of “against all,” a traditional option that was omitted from this year’s poll. But virtually all voters said they were casting ballots for the president. Ada G. Komanova, 76, raved over the services provided to the elderly through the Nazarbayev Fund: a health clinic, concerts, a senior center “so cozy, it’s like a fairy tale.” Kanat, a construction worker who would not give his last name, said he had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev, even though he thought the president and his family had enriched themselves fabulously over the last two decades. “They already have everything they need,” he said. “They can afford to think about the public.” Summary:","output":"Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev appears to have secured re-election as President after a swift campaign season in the country.

One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B?  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Particle B would have a lower temperature. This is because temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, resulting in a lower temperature.

Summarize the following: To make a cake model, you will need:  Cake mix, as well as the ingredients to make the mix Vanilla icing Food coloring of choice Various candies to represent the organelles, such as blue Mike and Ikes, pink Mike and Ikes, War Heads, Air Heads, sour gummy worms and sprinkles Toothpicks Labels Use a round cake pan for an animal cell and a rectangular shaped cake pan for a plant cell.  Follow the instructions on the package to bake the cake. You can also set aside a little of the batter to make one cupcake to represent the nucleus. Let the cake cool completely and then remove it from the pan. Place it on the cake board. You can also make 2 9 in (23 cm) cakes to layer on top of each other if you'd prefer a taller cell model. Dye the vanilla icing with the food dye, based on the color(s) you'd like to use to represent the cell components.  One option is to make separate colored icings to represent the different layers of the cell. For example, to make an animal cell, you could use yellow icing to represent the cytoplasm and red icing on the cupcake representing the nucleus.  If you are making a plant cell, you can make colored icing to distinguish the cell wall and spread it on the sides of the cake. It may be helpful to have a printout or image of the cell to identify the cell components as you place them on the cake. An example of good candies to use as components of an animal cell include:  Pink Mike and Ikes for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Blue Mike and Ikes for the mitochondria.

The Master","output":"Title: \\"The Master’s Pull\\" Plot: In the year 2050, the SS Virtuous, a state-of-the-art spacecraft crewed by a team of interstellar scientists and astronauts, goes on an ambitious deep-space expedition to the farthest borders of the known universe. From Earth, the crew's mission is to find and collect particles of a unique energy source believed to exist only in uncharted space. The crew is made up of Captain Robert Hanley, an experienced astronaut,  Dr. Ava Rhodes, a physicist, biologist Dr. Oliver Gibson, and communications officer Lilly Chen. One day, the ship's sensors pick up an unusual energy reading from an uncharted planet, something that matches the anticipated signature of the energy source they were sent to collect. They decide to investigate and land on the planet. But as they explore the alien world, they are hit by a massive gravitational force that they can't explain. The force, which they refer to as \\"The Master,\\" pulls everything towards it with increasing intensity, forcing the crew to leave hastily. Back on the ship, they discover that the Master's pull is getting stronger and drawing the SS Virtuous towards the planet. The crew struggles to escape its gravitational pull, battling against the fuel depleting rapidly and systems failing progressively. Meanwhile, on Earth, the mission controllers lose contact with the SS Virtuous and fear the worst for their crew. However, a rogue scientist, Dr. Sarah Turner, believes there's a way to save them.  On the SS Virtuous, the situation is increasingly dire, and Captain Hanley makes a brave decision. He chooses to dive the ship at full speed towards the Master in a risky maneuver hoping to use the planet’s own gravity to create a slingshot effect which could catapult them back into space.  Dr. Rhodes, however,fears that the intense gravitational pull might destroy the ship in the process. Then she remembers an experimental propulsion system she had been working on. This new system was not fully tested but expected to yield a stronger thrust than their current engines. In a desperate attempt, Dr. Rhodes and others implement this new propulsion system onto the ship. Back on Earth, Dr. Turner is able to tap into the SS Virtuous's weak signal and manages to guide the crew on how to stabilize the energy field around the ship using the gravitation particle they've collected on the planet, shielding them from the most devastating effects of the Master's pull. With one final surge of power, the captain maneuvers the SS Virt, and in combination with their new propulsion system, they rocket away from the Master's pull, leaving the deadly force behind. Their unconventional exit catapults them through space, and they find themselves right back at Earth faster than anticipated due to a miraculous bend in space-time. The movie ends with a relieved and joyous celebration at the control center as the ship and its crew make a triumphant return to Earth. This victorious return is immediately followed by a grave realization: their exploration and escape from the Master have led to an unprecedented discovery—wormhole travel. The mystery of the Master unraveled a new era for space travel, endowing humanity with the unexpected gift of exploring farthest reaches of the universe. Thus, \\"The Master's Pull\\" becomes a legacy of the bravest crew in the annals of Human Civilization, with a tale of courage, survival, and mind-bending scientific enlightenment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this sentence, the context appears to describe a particular admiral's uniform that gained significant recognition due to its association with a king. This uniform was favored by the king, who frequently wore it, adding to its notoriety. The connection between the uniform, the admiral, and the king made it a highly valued and unique piece in historical context. It might have become a symbol of prestige, power, or even national pride due to its connection with the king.  Moreover, the uniform was likely designed with specific embellishments, patterns, or colors that made it stand out from other standard military uniforms. These distinctive features allowed it to gain recognition and make it easier to associate with the king and the admiral it originally belonged to. As the king continuously wore the admiral's uniform, it became a significant symbol of his preference, respect, or admiration for the admiral in question, suggesting a close relationship between the two individuals. Additionally, it is probable that the admiral's achievements and contributions to the kingdom were highly respected and admired. The uniform served as a reminder of these accomplishments, making it an essential part of the kingdom's cultural and military history. Both the king and the public could look at the uniform and remember the admiral's valor, strategic prowess, or other attributes which had proven beneficial to their nation. Furthermore, the popularity and importance of this admiral's uniform could have reached beyond the borders of the kingdom, as neighboring kingdoms took notice of the king's preferences and the distinct attire. Such admiration and influence may have led to other nations adopting similar uniforms or design elements to pay tribute or express their respect towards the mentioned admiral or the king. In conclusion, the renown of this admiral's uniform lies in its close association with the king who held it in high esteem, frequently wearing it. The uniform became an emblem of prestige, power, and national pride thanks to its distinctive design and representation of a notable admiral's accomplishments. The king's preference for the uniform likely strengthened the connection between the royal court and the military, while its renown and influence possibly spread beyond their kingdom, further enhancing its historical significance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Answer the following question: Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya?","output":"Based on the given background information, Tanzania would likely have a thinner A horizon compared to Kenya.

Unlike Lawrence, who had a more disciplined approach towards his expenses, Jason struggled to maintain a balance between his income and expenditures. Step 1: Analyze the given text and find the primary reasons for the difference between Jason and Lawrence. The primary reasons mentioned in the text are Jason's poor financial decision-making and Lawrence's disciplined approach. Step 2: Expand on Jason's poor financial decision-making. Jason had a habit of indulging in impulsive shopping. He would see something he liked and buy it, often without considering whether he actually needed it or if he could afford it. This led him to accumulate debt. Step 3: Compare Lawrence's financial discipline. On the other hand, Lawrence always kept a careful eye on his budget. He prioritized saving and investing, ensuring that his expenses remained lower than his income. By doing so, he was able to maintain a debt-free lifestyle. Step 4: Mention any other factors that contributed to their financial situations. Another factor that set Jason and Lawrence apart was their attitude towards credit. Jason saw credit cards as an easy way to access funds without realizing the potential consequences. He frequently used credit to fund his purchases, racking up high interest charges on his cards. Lawrence, however, understood the importance of using credit responsibly and only utilized it when necessary, keeping his debt in check. Step 5: Summarize the main points. In conclusion, Jason was worse than Lawrence at being debt-free due to his impulsive shopping habits, poor financial decision-making, and irresponsible use of credit. Lawrence's disciplined approach to his finances, understanding of responsible credit use, and focus on saving and investing allowed him to maintain a debt-free lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon arriving back in England, Pochettino made it clear that both players had earned more regular slots in the first team, and they went on to have successful seasons for the Spurs. Kane continued to establish himself as one of Europe's deadliest strikers, while Townsend's pace and skill caused numerous headaches for Premier League defenses. As the years went on, the pair developed into key figures in the Tottenham Hotspur side, guiding their team domestically and in continental competitions. Ultimately, their careers reached new heights with significant contributions at international level for England. As their careers progressed, they both became instrumental figures in their respective clubs and on the international stage. And so the story comes to a close, with Kane and Townsend having seized the opportunities presented to them on that fateful night in Greece. The attacking duo carved impressive careers for themselves, both at a club and international level, earning their place in the pantheon of English footballing heroes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: The defenses dominated the first three drives of the game, all ending in punts. But midway through the first quarter, Malcom Brown and Patrick Chung shared a tackle of Kenneth Dixon in the end zone for a safety(the third by the Patriots' defense on the season). The Ravens forced the Patriots to punt, and, aided by a 40-yard gain from Joe Flacco to Kyle Juszczyk and a 15-yard pass interference penalty on Cyrus Jones, drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Shea McClellin blocked Justin Tucker's field goal attempt. Following that, the Patriots covering 74 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, his 14th, which tied him with Curtis Martin who had 14 for the 1995 New England Patriots. The Ravens reached Patriot territory on their following possession, too, but punted again. Aided by a 61-yard completion to White, the Patriots raced 89 yards in just eight plays with Brady finding Mitchell on a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 16-0. On the second plays of the Ravens next drive, McCourty intercepted Flacco at the Patriots 22 and returned it 40 yards to the Ravens 38, but official review ruled him down by contact at the Patriots 23. Despite this, the Patriots reached the Ravens 1-yard line, but Eric Weddle intercepted Brady(only his second interception of the season) and returned it 14 yards to the Ravens 10. Two possessions later, after Devin Hester returned a punt 12 yards to the Ravens 28, the Ravens reached the Patriots 28 and got on board with a 50-yard Tucker field goal with 0:11 seconds left in the half, making the score 16-3 at halftime. After forcing the Ravens to punt on the initial drive of the third quarter, the Patriots marched 65 yards to score on Brady's 19-yard pass to Bennett, increasing the lead to 23-3. A 6-yard run by Blount on the drive game him 1,005 yards for the season. However, the Ravens got back in the game with aide from the Patriots. While the Ravens offense continued it's ineptitude, Cyrus Jones muffed a punt with Chris Moore recovering at the Patriots 3. Two plays later, Flacco connected with Darren Waller for a two-yard touchdown pass, trimning the deficit to 23-10. Things got better for the Ravens with Matthew Slater fumbling the kick return and Shareece Wright recovering at the Patriots 22-yard line. Four plays later, Dixon caught a swing pass for an 8-yard touchdown, and all of a sudden the score was 23-17. After three consecutive punts, the Ravens, aided by a 47-yard catch by Breshad Perriman, reached the Patriots 12, but on 3rd-and-4 Flacco was sacked by Ninkovich for an 8-yard loss. Tucker finished the drive with a 38-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 23-20 with 6:35 remaining in the game. On the first play of the Patriots next drive, Brady found Chris Hogan wide open for a 79-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots lead to 30-20. That was Brady's 450th career touchdown pass and only Hogan's second career 100-yard receiving game. Yet, the Ravens were still in the game, driving to the Patriots 20-yard line, Tucker hit a 37-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 30-23 and giving the Ravens a chance. On the Patriots next drive, the Ravens brought the game to a 4th-and-1 with 0:13 remaining. Instead of punting, the Patriots went for the kill shot and got it with Blount's 3-yard run enabling the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. The Patriots improved to 11-2 and dropped 496 yards of total offense and 30 points on the Ravens' top-ranked defense, both the most allowed in the season by the Ravens. The Patriots posted their 10th all-time franchise victory against the Ravens. This was Brady's 100th career home win and his 9th 400+ yard passing game of his career and his second of the season.

Context: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Lars Erik Frederiksen (born Lars Everett Dapello 30 August 1971) is a Danish-American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer best known as the guitarist and vocalist for the punk rock band Rancid, as well as the frontman of Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards and The Old Firm Casuals. He was also briefly a member of the UK Subs in 1991. He joined Rancid in 1993 after the band was searching for a second guitar player and was present on their second album \\"Let's Go\\". He has produced albums for bands such as Agnostic Front, The Business, Dropkick Murphys, Swingin Utters, Marky Ramone and the Intruders, Anti-Heros, Patriot, The Forgotten, Harrington Saints, and Pressure Point. He recently mixed Charged GBH's new album entitled \\"Perfume and Piss\\", as well as Cock Sparrer's album \\"Here We Stand\\" both alongside Michael Rosen.  - The Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1996. The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the label, and making a name for themselves locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held in and around Boston. The 2004 single \\"Tessie\\" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest charting singles to date. The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's \\"The Warrior's Code\\", included the song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"; the song was featured in the 2006 Academy Award-winning movie \\"The Departed\\", and went on to become the band's only Platinum-selling single to date, and remains one of their best-known songs. The band is known for their loud, energetic live shows.  - Charged GBH, commonly known as GBH, are an English street punk band which was formed in 1978 by vocalist Colin Abrahall, guitarist Colin \\"Jock\\" Blyth, bassist Sean McCarthy (replaced by Ross Lomas by the time they had signed to Clay records) and Drummer Andy \\"Wilf\\" Williams. GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \\"UK82\\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music.

Choices:  - cultures  - tropics  - zones  - epochs  A: Answer:","output":"The geologic time scale is a system that organizes Earth's history based on major events, changes, and developments that happened throughout time. It is divided into four main levels of classification: eons, eras, periods, and epochs. The correct choice among the given options is epochs. 1. Eons: Eons are the largest intervals of geologic time, spanning hundreds to thousands of millions of years. There are four eons recognized in Earth's history: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic:    a. Hadean: This eon covers the time from Earth's formation (approximately 4.6 billion years ago) until around 4 billion years ago. The Earth was still cooling and solidifying during this time, and there was no life yet.        b. Archean: This eon spans from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. During the Archean, the Earth's crust was forming and stabilizing, and the earliest forms of life started to appear, such as single-celled organisms known as prokaryotes.        c. Proterozoic: The Proterozoic eon covers the time from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago. During this eon, eukaryotes, more complex single-celled organisms, evolved, and significant amounts of oxygen were released through photosynthesis.        d. Phanerozoic: This eon started about 541 million years ago and continues through the present day. It is characterized by the rapid evolution of multicellular life forms and the development of complex ecosystems. 2. Eras: Eras are the next level down in the geologic time scale, and each eon is divided into several eras. For example, the Phanerozoic eon is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. 3. Periods: Each era is further divided into periods, which generally range from tens to hundreds of millions of years. For instance, the Mesozoic era has three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. 4. Epochs: Epochs are the smallest divisions of geologic time, usually lasting a few million years. Each period is divided into several epochs. For example, the Cenozoic era's current period, the Quaternary, is divided into two epochs: the Holocene (the current epoch) and the Pleistocene. In summary, the geologic time scale is a hierarchical system that classifies Earth's history into eons, eras, periods, and epochs. This organization helps geologists and other scientists better understand and describe the various events and changes that have occurred throughout our planet's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Both teams began the game with field goals, as Cleveland kicker Phil Dawson made a 44-yard field goal while Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 31-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback Brady Quinn completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback Matthew Stafford completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back Aaron Brown. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back Kevin Smith on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, Cleveland would end the half with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. Detroit would take the lead in the third quarter with Stafford's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Will Heller, the Browns would pick up a safety after Stafford was called for intentional grounding from his own end zone. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland regained the lead with Quinn's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Gaines (followed by running back Jamal Lewis getting a 2-point conversion run). The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety Brodney Pool intercepted the ball. However, cornerback Hank Poteat was flagged for pass interference in the end zone. Since the game cannot end on a defensive penalty, Detroit was given one un-timed down from the Browns' 1-yard line and Stafford completed the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end Brandon Pettigrew. With the loss in the 1-8 battle, Cleveland fell to 1-9 assuring them that they would finish last in their division. Question: How many yards of touchdowns were scored in the first half?
