Walking can help the baby shift in the uterus, causing it to the descend towards the pubic bone. This sends a signal to your body that the baby is ready to be born, which may trigger labor to progress. Available options:  a). The point is to also make sure that you are not experiencing any uterine contractions. Walking also boosts blood flow in the area, reducing the risk of infections.;  b). Walking up and down stairs can be especially helpful to shift a baby in the right position for birth. Shift around when you're lying down.;  c). In turn, your sex hormones are activated, which burns off blood sugar within the uterus. Consult a doctor and your primary care provider before creating a baby ward.;  d). Make sure that you walk around the united states, or the united kingdom, for at least 20 minutes during the days leading up to labor. Walking can have a positive effect on the baby's development.;. The answer should be","output":"b). Walking up and down stairs can be especially helpful to shift a baby in the right position for birth. Shift around when you're lying down. In addition to simply walking, going up and down stairs can provide additional benefits when it comes to getting your baby into the correct position for birth. The uneven movements and changes in elevation can encourage the baby to shift even more effectively in the uterus, promoting the optimal fetal positioning. This positioning can make it easier for your cervix to dilate and for contractions to progress in a more efficient manner. Moreover, it's important to change your position when lying down. Instead of lying in one position for an extended period, try varying your posture by using cushions and pillows to prop yourself up in different ways. This can help prevent discomfort and allow the baby to continue moving and adjusting as necessary. In summary, while engaging in physical activities like walking and walking up and down stairs, make sure to also pay attention to your resting positions to ensure that the baby remains in an optimal position for a smoother labor process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Question: Was the man who sent the German Africa Corps to reverse the in situation in Africa younger than the man who commanded it? Passage 1:Eisner had used some of Digital Domain's processors to render images for his film, and the company suggested he meet with some commercial production houses. Thus began his career as a director of commercials, and after only a year-and-a-half, Eisner had directed 14 high-profile spots. His first commercial was Budweiser's Powersurge, which aired during the 1997 Super Bowl. He also took the helm for Rold Gold pretzels' \\"Comrades\\" starring Jason Alexander, which featured Pretzel Boy on a rescue mission to the Mir space station.

He has also done commercials for Sony, Sega and Coca-Cola.  Passage 2:Midori gave her first public performance at the age of six, playing one of the 24 Caprices of Paganini in her native Osaka. In 1982 she and her mother moved to New York City, where Midori started violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at Pre-College Division of Juilliard School and the Aspen Music Festival and School. As her audition piece, Midori performed Bach's thirteen-minute-long Chaconne, generally considered one of the most difficult solo violin pieces. In the same year, she made her concert debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, a conductor with whom she would later record on the Sony Classical label. In 1986 came her legendary performance of Leonard Bernstein's Serenade at Tanglewood, conducted by Bernstein. During the performance, she broke the E string on her violin, then again on the concertmaster's Stradivarius after she borrowed it. She finished the performance with the associate concertmaster's Guadagnini and received a standing ovation. The next day The New York Times front page carried the headline, \\"Girl, 14, Conquers Tanglewood with 3 Violins\\".  Passage 3:General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor, (21 August 1889 – 17 June 1981) was a senior British Army officer who fought in both the First and Second World Wars, and commanded the Western Desert Force in the early years of the Second World War. He was the field commander for Operation Compass, in which his forces destroyed a much larger Italian army – a victory which nearly drove the Axis from Africa, and in turn, led Adolf Hitler to send the German Africa Corps under Erwin Rommel to try to reverse the situation. O'Connor was captured by a German reconnaissance patrol during the night of 7 April 1941 and spent over two years in an Italian prisoner of war camp. He eventually escaped after the fall of Mussolini in the autumn of 1943. In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in the Battle of Normandy and later during Operation Market Garden. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India and then, in the closing days of British rule in the subcontinent, he headed Northern Command. His final job in the army was Adjutant-General to the Forces in London, in charge of the British Army's administration, personnel and organisation.

Question: I can use this background: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution.  Now, I have a new situation: Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity.  Answer this question please: In which ocean's acidity test Rob would have to add less base, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific ocean? Answer:","output":"Rob would have to add less base in the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test.  The reason for this is based on the principles of acid-base titration and Rob's conclusion that the Atlantic Ocean's acidity is higher than that of the Pacific Ocean. Acid-base titration is a process used to determine the concentration of an acid. This process involves adding a known quantity of a strong base solution (usually NaOH or KOH) to the acidic solution until it is neutralized, which is usually indicated by a color change of the indicator that is added to the solution. In an acidic solution, the number of hydrogen ions (H+) will be higher than hydroxide ions (OH-). The added base neutralizes the acid by combining with the hydrogen ions to form water (H2O), thus reducing the number of free hydrogen ions in the solution, which subsequently increases the pH of the solution. This means that the more acidic a solution is, the more base it would require to neutralize the acid and increase pH to a neutral level. Hence, given Rob's conclusion that the Atlantic Ocean is more acidic than the Pacific Ocean, it would require more base to neutralize the higher acidity in the Atlantic Ocean. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean, having a lower acidity level, would require less base in its acidity test due to its lower concentration of free hydrogen ions. Consequently, Rob would have to add less base in the Pacific Ocean's acidity test as compared to that of the Atlantic Ocean. It's important to remember that the level of acidity is not constant or evenly distributed in the oceans. It may vary by depth, nearness to land or other factors. Therefore, while Rob's tests give important information about overall acidity levels, additional testing may be necessary to provide a more complete view of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A scene may be shot from several camera angles simultaneously. This will give a different experience and sometimes emotion. The different camera angles will have different effects on the viewer and how they perceive the scene that is shot. There are a few different routes that a camera operator could take to achieve this effect. The typical shot measurements unit is the milliframe. Milliframes are used to calculate how much the shot should be moved to perfect the camera angles. One milliframe (mF) equals about .328cm (0.129 inches). However, the exact size of a milliframe is almost impossible to calculate since it is not a physical measurement.   - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe.

Write an article based on this \\"Bosses of some of the UK's newer and smaller banks are meeting Treasury officials to complain that a new surcharge on profits is unfair.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Smaller UK Banks Protest Treasury's Proposed Profit Surcharge as Unfair Introduction: Several smaller and newer UK-based banks have expressed disapproval with a planned surcharge imposed on their profits, and calling the measures unfair. Recently, these bank bosses have joined forces in a meeting with Treasury officials to voice their concerns and complain about the negative impact of such a policy on their growth and competitiveness. Step 1: Introduce the issue at hand The UK Treasury has proposed a new regulation, which brings with it a surcharge on the profits of numerous banks. However, bosses of some smaller and newer UK banks view this regulation as an unfair burden on their financial operations. This has led to heightened tensions between these banks and the Treasury as bank bosses actively seek to contest the proposed surcharge. Step 2: Identify the reason for the new surcharge The UK Treasury stands by the proposed surcharge on bank profits, with the government defending it as a necessary measure to protect the financial stability of the country. According to the Treasury, this move will help ensure that the banking sector remains resilient in the face of future macroeconomic challenges and maintains a fair contribution to the system. Step 3: Discuss the concerns raised by smaller banks Smaller and newer banks within the UK argue that this surcharge unfairly targets their operations, placing additional strain on their ability to grow and compete in an already cut-throat market. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach to bank regulation is inappropriate and unjustly disadvantages smaller financial institutions, which are still trying to establish themselves. Step 4: Provide examples of affected banks and their viewpoint Challenger banks such as Monzo, Starling, and Atom are among the institutions at the forefront of the opposition against the proposed surcharge. They believe that by placing a disproportionate burden on their businesses, the government is effectively stifling innovation and making it harder for these smaller competitors to challenge the more established 'big four' UK banks. Step 5: Mention the response from Treasury officials Although Treasury officials have yet to make a decision on the surcharge, they have agreed to review the concerns raised by smaller bank bosses. It remains crucial that they strike a balance between maintaining financial stability and fostering a competitive and innovative banking landscape in the UK. Conclusion: Smaller and newer UK banks are protesting the Treasury's proposed profit surcharge, claiming it unfairly targets their operations and hinders their growth. The larger debate raises crucial questions about the balance of financial stability and the importance of fostering a competitive market. Providing Treasury officials with a more comprehensive understanding of the adverse impact on these smaller institutions may help influence future policy decisions that benefit all players in the financial sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.  and the situation: Two biologists studied different living creatures. Matt studied protozoa, while his friend Greg studied nematodes and insects.  Answer the following question: Which friend studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check? Answer:","output":"Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background and situation - Protozoa are consumers and some are predators that prey upon other single-celled organisms like bacteria, thus keeping bacterial populations in check. - Matt studied protozoa while Greg studied nematodes and insects. Step 2: Compare the subjects of study for each friend - Matt studied protozoa, which includes predatory protozoa that help control bacterial populations. - Greg studied nematodes and insects, which are larger organisms and not primarily focused on protozoa or their role in controlling bacterial populations. Step 3: Determine which friend's studies align more with the question topic - Matt's studies on protozoa directly relate to the topic of predatory protozoa and their role in controlling bacterial populations. Conclusion: Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check because his subject of study, protozoa, directly involves the organisms that play this role in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The options given are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Step 1: Understand the problem. We know that a's height is 20% less than b's height. Let b's height be x. So, a's height will be (100 - 20) % of x, which is 80% of x or 0.8x. Step 2: Find the percentage difference between their heights. Now, we have to find how much percent b's height (x) is more than a's height (0.8x). Step 3: Set up the formula for percentage difference. The formula for percentage difference in this case is: ((b's height - a's height) / a's height) * 100 Step 4: Apply the formula. ((x - 0.8x) / 0.8x) * 100 (0.2x / 0.8x) * 100 Step 5: Calculate and simplify. (0.2 / 0.8) * 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 % Step 6: Match the result with the given options.

Choices: [-] No; [-] Yes; The answer is:","output":"No; the statement \\"Psychologists of diverse stripes also consider the unconscious mind.\\" does not accurately represent the three mental states in psychology. The three mental states in psychology typically refer to consciousness, preconsciousness, and unconsciousness. 1. Consciousness: This is the mental state of being aware of and able to think and perceive one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings at any given moment. Consciousness enables individuals to respond to their environment and make informed decisions. 2. Preconsciousness: This refers to the mental state in which information is stored in our memory but is not currently in conscious awareness. Preconscious information can be easily retrieved and brought into consciousness when necessary. Examples include remembering an old friend's name or a specific fact when it becomes relevant. 3. Unconsciousness: This is the mental state that contains thoughts, memories, desires, and experiences that are not available to conscious awareness. The unconscious mind plays a significant role in influencing our behavior, emotions, and decision-making processes. It contains repressed memories, unresolved conflicts, and deep-seated beliefs that shape our personalities and actions.

I have a new situation: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.  But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood.

What is an answer for this question: When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B?

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons: - Hang in closet: This option won't address the smell, and it can actually spread the odor to other clothes in the closet, making the situation worse. - Sniff: This action does not address or solve the problem of the smell; it merely confirms that the clothes have an odor. - Get dirty: Deliberately making the clothes dirty is counterproductive, as it exacerbates the problem rather than solving it. - Become soiled: Similar to \\"get dirty,\\" this option does not provide a solution to the problem and could cause the smell to intensify. In summary, airing out the clothes is the most effective and logical choice for dealing with garments that have developed a smell but cannot be washed. This process allows for the gradual dissipation of the odor, leaving your clothes smelling fresher and more pleasant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer: The Jewish language Yiddish is based on which other language ?","output":"Yiddish, a Jewish language with a rich history that dates back to around the 10th century, is primarily based on Middle High German with additional linguistic influences from Hebrew, Aramaic, and various Slavic and Romance languages. It is written using the Hebrew alphabet and demonstrates the fusion of Jewish culture with Central European linguistic elements. Middle High German, a form of the High German spoken between the 11th and 14th centuries, serves as the major foundation of Yiddish grammar and vocabulary. Over time, Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews migrated through different European regions and adapted their language by borrowing words, phrases, and pronunciations from local languages. This contributed to regional dialects within Yiddish itself, which were primarily classified into two main groups: Western (or Central) Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish. Western Yiddish, which was primarily spoken in Central Europe (Germany, France, and the Netherlands), derives many of its features from the West Central German dialect. Eastern Yiddish, on the other hand, was spoken mainly in Eastern Europe (Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, and Russia) and incorporated elements from the East Central German dialect as well as from Slavic languages such as Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian. Eastern Yiddish is further divided into three dialect groups: Southeastern (Ukrainian-Bessarabian), Mideastern (Polish-Lithuanian), and Northeastern (Belarusian-Latvian). In addition to Middle High German and Slavic influences, Yiddish also includes a significant amount of vocabulary borrowed from Hebrew and Aramaic. These Hebrew and Aramaic terms were initially incorporated for religious and liturgical purposes, as both languages are traditional Jewish languages and key to religious life and learning. Over time, Hebrew and Aramaic words for everyday life also found their way into the Yiddish lexicon. Furthermore, Yiddish adopted words from Romance languages such as Old French and Old Italian, primarily through contact with neighboring Jewish communities. The development and evolution of Yiddish serves as a testament to the adaptability and resilience of the Ashkenazi Jewish community. In the face of political, social, and economic changes throughout history, Yiddish has continued to serve as a vital cultural and linguistic link among Ashkenazi Jews across the globe. Despite experiencing declines in the number of speakers due to factors such as the Holocaust and assimilation, Yiddish has experienced a revival in recent years, with a renewed interest in studying and preserving this unique and historically significant language."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes. When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband. When the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and just said, \\"I'm with you, darling.\\" The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to blame . She had also lost her only child.

Summarize this article: They said thousands of Britons had been unable to bring a non-EU spouse to the UK since July 2012, when minimum earnings requirements were introduced. Children have also been separated from a parent, the parliamentary group said. The Home Office said the rules were designed to ease the burden of migration on the taxpayer. Under rules that came into force a year ago only British citizens who can show they earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each further child. The inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration, which is calling for an independent review of the minimum income requirement, looked at more than 175 cases from families affected by the rules. Forty-five claimed their inability to meet the income threshold had led to the separation of children, including British children, from a non-EU parent, the group said. In one case, a woman from outside Europe had been separated from her British husband and two sons, including a five-month-old baby she had been breastfeeding. Douglas Shillinglaw, from Kent, is among those to have been affected. His wife is in Lagos, Nigeria, with his five-month old son and her six-year-old son from another relationship. Mr Shillinglaw, a self-employed mortgage broker for two years, told the BBC he was being \\"judged like an employed person\\". \\"Self-employed income is different from employed income. I have got enough money to pay my mortgage and bills, and that should be enough,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"And should anything happen to me, I have a family that will take care of them. My family are wholeheartedly behind what I am doing.\\" Mark Reckless, Conservative MP on the home affairs select committee, said the government had promised to bring down net immigration and it had done so by \\"bearing down\\" on bogus colleges, caps on work visas and reforms on family immigration. \\"If you are bringing someone into the country, then you should be expected to support that person without recourse to public expense,\\" he told Today. \\"Over time, it might be possible that the regulations could be adjusted. There will be hard cases and we learn in light of those experiences.\\" The group also heard from a number of UK sponsors in full-time employment at or above the national minimum wage who reported that they were unable to meet the income requirement. Wider evidence suggested that 47% of the UK working population last year would have failed to meet the income level to sponsor a non-European Economic Area partner, the group said. By the government's own estimate, almost 18,000 British people will be prevented from being reunited with their spouse or partner in the UK every year as a result of the new rules, it added. Baroness Hamwee, chairwoman of the inquiry and Liberal Democrat home affairs lead in the House of Lords, said the parliamentary group had been \\"struck by the evidence showing just how many British people have been kept apart from partners, children and elderly relatives\\". \\"These rules are causing anguish for families and, counter to their original objectives, may actually be costing the public purse,\\" she said. Liberal Democrat group member Sarah Teather MP said that \\"whatever the objective of the policy, children shouldn't suffer as a result\\". A Home Office spokesman said the rules had been designed to make sure those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner would not become a burden on the taxpayer and would be well enough supported to integrate effectively. \\"High-value migrants would not be refused because their British spouse or partner was not employed,\\" he said. \\"They can meet the income threshold by having cash savings of £62,500 or through their own private income, for example from investments. We have also introduced greater flexibility for those holding investments to liquidate them into cash in order to meet the rules.\\" Summary:","output":"The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration is calling for an independent review of the minimum income requirement for British citizens to sponsor a non-EU spouse's visa.

It’s like the body’s lifeline. Without the cardiovascular system circulating your blood, you couldn’t survive.   Q: What system of organs delivers blood to all cells of the body?   A: Answer:","output":"The cardiovascular system is the system of organs that delivers blood to all cells of the body. This system plays a crucial role in ensuring that blood, which carries essential nutrients and oxygen, reaches each cell in our body to maintain their normal functioning and overall health. The main components of the cardiovascular system include the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. Let's discuss each of these components in more detail. 1. Heart: The heart is a muscular organ that serves as the pump for the cardiovascular system. It is made up of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The heart's main function is to contract and push blood through the blood vessels. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The left side of the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of the body. 2. Blood vessels: These are the tubes through which blood flows. Blood vessels can be categorized into three types:   a. Arteries: Arteries are thick-walled blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, delivering it to various tissues and organs throughout the body. The largest artery in the body is the aorta, which originates from the left ventricle of the heart and branches out to supply blood to the entire body.      b. Veins: Veins transport oxygen-poor blood back to the heart from the body's tissues. They have thinner walls compared to arteries and larger lumens (inner diameters) to allow for the return of large volumes of blood at lower pressure. The largest veins in the body are the superior and inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium of the heart.      c. Capillaries: These are the smallest and most numerous blood vessels in the body. They form a network between arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, waste products, and other molecules between the blood and the surrounding cells. This exchange takes place through the thin walls of the capillaries, which facilitate the diffusion of these substances. 3. Blood: Blood is the liquid component of the cardiovascular system that serves as the medium for the transport of nutrients, oxygen, waste products, and other essential substances. It is composed of plasma (the liquid portion) and various blood cells, which include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In summary, the cardiovascular system is the system of organs that delivers blood to all cells of the body. It comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Without this crucial system circulating blood throughout the body, we would not be able to survive, as our cells would not receive the necessary nutrients and oxygen needed for their proper functioning and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The first outstanding deaf teacher in America was a Frenchman Laurent Clerc. He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open. On the long trip, they had many conversations about education and deafness. The year after they arrived, they founded a school for the deaf in Harford, Connecticut.

When they talk to an Indian, they would find he would often shake his head. The visitors might think that the Indian doesn't like what they say. But in fact, they would be completely wrong. Indians always shake their heads when they talk to others. It doesn't mean \\"No\\". If someone wants to visit India, he should know this, or he will be in trouble. One day, a foreign officer went to India on business. He hired a car and asked an Indian to drive him. When he told his driver to take him to his office, the Indian shook his head at once. The officer said again and the driver shook his head again.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal   signals is basic to the growth and development of language. A:","output":"A: According to the article, which factor is crucial for a child's language acquisition during the first year of life? 1. The presence of other children 2.

Good mothering and interaction with the child Explanation: In the article, it is stated that good mothering is essential for survival and language acquisition during the first year of life. This is due to the interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes and responds to the child's nonverbal signals, which is crucial to the growth and development of language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who published a paper with the Geological Society of London on January 4th 1837 showing that the South American land mass was gradually rising?","output":"On January 4th, 1837, Charles Robert Darwin published a paper with the Geological Society of London that showed evidence of the South American landmass gradually rising. The paper was titled \\"Observations of the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of Other Parts of Lochaber in Scotland, with an Attempt to Prove that They Are of Marine Origin\\". Charles Darwin, an eminent English naturalist and biologist, is best known for his groundbreaking work on the theory of evolution, but he also made significant contributions to the field of geology. During his voyage on the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836, Darwin visited South America and conducted extensive geological research, collecting numerous rock samples and making observations on the topography and geological structures. During his travels, Darwin noted that there were raised beaches and marine shells at various elevations along the coastline of South America. He was particularly struck by the presence of shells at substantial heights above the sea level near Valparaiso, Chile. These observations, along with the occurrence of earthquakes and the ongoing geological research of his contemporaries, led Darwin to hypothesize that the landmass was undergoing a gradual uplift process. Darwin's paper presented detailed evidence of the uplift of the South American coastline and became an important contribution to the understanding of vertical crustal movements in the region. In the subsequent years, his theory was refined and expanded upon, revealing connections between earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the forces that shape Earth's surface. The paper is notable not only for its geological content but also as an early example of Darwin's thinking about the interconnectedness of natural phenomena. Darwin's ideas about the mechanisms of Earth's crustal deformation foreshadowed the development of plate tectonics theory more than a century later. Moreover, the observations made during his voyage significantly influenced the development of his groundbreaking work, \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection\\" (1859), where he presented the concept of evolution through natural selection, forever changing the understanding of the history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Overall, they should maintain the original message, but use different words and grammar. The first sentence states: \\"Smith, born in Giddings, Texas, began his career in the Black baseball-equivalent of small leagues with the Austin Black Senators in Austin, Texas.\\" This sentence provides the assertion that Smith was born in Giddings, Texas, whereas he began his career with the Austin Black Senators, a baseball team presumed to be from a black baseball-equivalent of small leagues, located in Austin, Texas.  The second sentence says: \\"Smith, born in Austin, Texas, began his career in the equivalent of the black leagues with the Austin Black Senators in Giddings, Texas.\\" On the contrary, this sentence indicates that Smith was born in Austin, Texas, and he started his career with the Austin Black Senators, a team from the black leagues-equivalent, but the team in this case is stated to be based in Giddings, Texas. In conclusion, the information in these sentences is switched. In the first sentence, Smith's birthplace is Giddings, Texas, and his career started in Austin, Texas, whereas in the second sentence, his birthplace is Austin, Texas and his career began in Giddings, Texas.

Answer this question: when did disney get the rights to winnie the pooh??","output":"Disney’s history with the character Winnie the Pooh goes a long way back. To answer your question, it's very important to understand the timeline of events that led to Disney gaining the rights to the lovable bear. Winnie the Pooh was originally based on a teddy bear owned by the son of English author A. A. Milne, Christopher Robin Milne. The first appearance of Winnie the Pooh was in a poem titled \\"Teddy Bear\\" in the \\"Punch\\" magazine published on February 13, 1924, and later in a collection of children's verses written by Milne called \\"When We Were Very Young\\" in 1924. The stories of Pooh and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood gained popularity, and Milne wrote more stories compiling them into a book, \\"Winnie-the-Pooh,\\" published on October 14, 1926. Due to its success, a second set of stories titled \\"The House at Pooh Corner\\" was later published in 1928. Coming to Disney, it was in 1961 when Walt Disney Productions acquired the film and other rights to A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books from the author’s estate. The decision was partly motivated by the fondness Walt Disney's daughters had for the charming bear and his friends. After Disney acquired the rights, the first Disney adaptation of Pooh was introduced to the world as a featurette on December 20, 1961. This was followed by \\"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\\" which premiered in 1966, marking the debut of the teddy bear and his friends according to the Disney animation style. It's important to note that Disney made an agreement in 1983 with Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and the estate of A. A. Milne to establish Disney has exclusive rights to the Winnie the Pooh characters in return for royalties paid to Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and the Milne estate. The agreement was subsequently renewed in 1998. Disney’s acquisition of the rights played a key role in revitalizing the popularity of Winnie the Pooh, and the rest is history. Since then, the brand has produced numerous animated series, feature films, merchandise, and even boasts a theme park ride at Disneyland, proving that the chubby little bear of very little brain has a very big place in our hearts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money (100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails. At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it. This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \\"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\\". Here's how I would have written it: An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it. But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.","output":"The sentiment of the review is negative. The person who wrote the review is unhappy with the film because they believe it fails in comparison to the original and that it could have been improved. They also think that the director, Tim Burton, did not do a good job with this film, and they wish they had not wasted time thinking about it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      LOS ANGELES (AP) — The recent death of director Zack Snyder's daughter has driven the prominent filmmaker to step away from finishing the ensemble superhero movie \\"Justice League.\\"      A source close to production who was not authorized to speak publicly said Monday that director Joss Whedon would take over completing the film, which should still hit its Nov. 17 release.      Snyder and his wife and producing partner Deborah Snyder told The Hollywood Reporter they will be using the time away to focus on their family and seven children.      The Reporter story stated Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, killed herself in March. Coroner's spokesman Ed Winter said Autumn Snyder's March 12 death is being investigated as a possible suicide due to an overdose of prescription medications. The official cause of death has been deferred pending toxicology results.      Snyder told the magazine that at first he tried to throw himself back into work, but in the past two months realized he needed to be with his family — especially as additional photography shoots in London loomed on the horizon.      \\"They are all having a hard time. I'm having a hard time,\\" Snyder said.      The Snyders are cornerstone players in Warner Bros. production of DC Comics films. He directed both \\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\" and \\"Man of Steel\\" and is serving as a producer on the additional films in the DC Universe, including last year's \\"Suicide Squad\\" and the upcoming \\"Wonder Woman.\\"      \\"Justice League\\" is a critical entry in the slate of DC films, bringing together major superheroes like Ben Affleck's Batman, Henry Cavill's Superman, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller's The Flash and Jason Momoa's Aquaman.      Whedon, who directed the Marvel Comics ensemble films \\"The Avengers\\" and its sequel \\"Age of Ultron,\\" and is writing and directing \\"Batgirl\\" for Warner Bros., has been working with Snyder on \\"Justice League\\" for over a month. In addition to post-production work, Whedon will also shoot some additional scenes for the film.      Warner Bros. Pictures president Toby Emmerich told the Reporter that the additional scenes will adhere to the style and template set by Snyder.      Snyder said he knows fans will be worried about the film without him at the helm.      But, he added, \\"In the end, it's just a movie. It's a great movie. But it's just a movie.\\" ||||| The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \\"I’ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\\"      Superheroes have always been about doing the right thing in the hardest of circumstances. Now Zack Snyder, one of the biggest filmmakers in the genre and the director of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and the upcoming Justice League, finds himself in just such a situation.      Snyder tells The Hollywood Reporter he is stepping away from Justice League, Warner Bros.’ all-star DC Comics superhero mega-movie that is in postproduction, in order to deal with the sudden death of his daughter. Snyder's wife, Deborah Snyder, who is a producer on Justice League, also is taking a break to focus on the healing of their family.      Stepping in to shepherd the movie through post and the shooting of some additional scenes will be Joss Whedon, the Avengers filmmaker and creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. With Whedon's help, the movie is still on track for its Nov. 17 release date.      Snyder’s daughter Autumn Snyder died by suicide in March at age 20. Her death has been kept private, with only a small inner circle aware of what happened, even as the movie was put on a two-week break for the Snyders to deal with the immediate effects of the tragedy. Zack Snyder says he initially was eager to return to the film, which stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller.      “In my mind, I thought it was a cathartic thing to go back to work, to just bury myself and see if that was the way through it,” said an emotional Snyder in an interview Monday in his office on the Warner Bros. lot, with Deborah sitting by his side. “The demands of this job are pretty intense. It is all-consuming. And in the last two months, I’ve come to the realization … I’ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me. They are all having a hard time. I’m having a hard time.”      The studio is fully behind the move. “What they are going through is unimaginable, and my heart — our hearts — go out to them,\\" says Warner Bros. Pictures president Toby Emmerich.      One of the first things the studio floated was the possibility of pushing back the release date of the movie, but the Snyders decided against that. Warners also extended Snyder's first-look deal to give him time to work on other planned projects when he returns to work.      Snyder, after screening a rough cut of Justice League for fellow filmmakers and friends, wanted to add additional scenes, so he brought Whedon on board to write them. But as he prepared to shoot the scenes in England, Snyder realized it was not the time to leave home. “The directing is minimal and it has to adhere to the style and tone and the template that Zack set,” says Emmerich. “We’re not introducing any new characters. It’s the same characters in some new scenes. He’s handing the baton to Joss, but the course has really been set by Zack. I still believe that despite this tragedy, we’ll still end up with a great movie.”      This isn’t the first time that Warner Bros. has had to deal with the unthinkable affecting a high-profile DC movie. In 2008, Heath Ledger passed away after shooting had wrapped for The Dark Knight but prior to the movie being finished and released. The tragedy put the studio and filmmaker Christopher Nolan in a very delicate position of balancing mourning with the demands of releasing a tentpole.      The internet and comic book movie fans being what they are, Snyder already is anticipating what some DC loyalists may think.      “Here’s the thing, I never planned to make this public,” he says. “I thought it would just be in the family, a private matter, our private sorrow that we would deal with. When it became obvious that I need to take a break, I knew there would be narratives created on the internet. They’ll do what they do. The truth is … I’m past caring about that kind of thing now.”      The death of Autumn, Zack's daughter from his first marriage, to Denise Snyder (in addition to Autumn, he and Deborah have been raising seven kids and step-kids), has brought a new perspective and a new focus for him. “I want the movie to be amazing, and I’m a fan, but that all pales pretty quickly in comparison,\\" he says. “I know the fans are going to be worried about the movie, but there are seven other kids that need me. In the end, it’s just a movie. It’s a great movie. But it’s just a movie.\\"      Autumn, who was attending Sarah Lawrence College, loved “to write, to write, to write,” says Deborah. Their daughter had written a sci-fi fantasy novel in the first person. It featured a character who was an outsider and who had trouble fitting in.      Deborah is holding on to the thought that she was the first person her daughter gave the book to read, even now as the story takes on a new meaning under the circumstances. “You’re hearing her voice,” Deborah says, fighting back tears.      The Snyders would like to some day see that manuscript published, with the proceeds going to a charity. “In the end, she didn’t make it, but her character does, and I think there would be something cathartic for people,” says Zack.      The thought of his daughter’s writing prompts Zack to recall another memory. Autumn had a quote that she included in everything she wrote. (“Every. Single. Thing,” chuckles Zack.) It’s from author Chuck Palahniuk: “We all die. The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.”      “Maybe this helps,” says Zack. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The tragic passing of director Zack Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, has led him to step away from finishing the highly anticipated ensemble superhero film \\"Justice League.\\" Following Autumn's death in March, which is being investigated as a possible suicide, Snyder tried to focus on his work but realized that he needed to support his family during this difficult time.

Context: There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... Question: Why did Anna continue answering the door?

She is stalked and attacked by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove. She awakens from the nightmare, but her mother points out four mysterious slashes in her gown. The following morning, Tina is consoled by her friend Nancy and her boyfriend, Glen. Later, Nancy and Glen sleepover with Tina following her mother's out-of-town departure. The sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend Rod, who tries to have sex to reconcile after arguing. Falling asleep, she sees the man and runs. Awakened by Tina's thrashing, Rod witnesses her being fatally slashed by an unseen force. He flees as Nancy and Glen find Tina, mistakenly blaming Rod. Nancy tells her father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, of Tina's death. The next day, Rod proclaims innocence to Nancy, but Don arrests him. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and finds the man, calling himself Freddy Krueger, chasing her in the boiler room. Nancy burns her arm on a pipe and awakens in the middle of class, excusing herself. She notices the burn mark on her arm and is concerned. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and nearly gets drowned by Freddy. Nancy goes to Rod, who tells her what happened to Tina, and Nancy believes Freddy is responsible for Tina's death. Nancy has Glen watch over her as she falls asleep. She tries to find Freddy and sees him preparing to kill Rod. He turns his attention on her; she runs and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. Nancy and Glen go to the jail and discover Rod has been hanged in his cell by his bed sheet in an apparent suicide. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes the man in her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a dream clinic. In her dream, Nancy is attacked again and grabs Freddy's hat. When the staff wake her up, she has a gash in her arm and she somehow has Freddy's hat with her. At home, Marge bars the windows and begins drinking heavily. Eventually, she tells Nancy that Freddy was a child murderer... The answer to this question is:","output":"What is the true identity of the disfigured man who attacks Tina in her dreams and how is he connected to the mysterious deaths of the teenagers in the story?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - In chemistry isomerization (also isomerisation) is the process by which one molecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms, but the atoms have a different arrangement e.g. A-B-C  B-A-C (these related molecules are known as isomers ). In some molecules and under some conditions, isomerization occurs spontaneously. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy, and so exist in roughly equal amounts, provided that they can interconvert somewhat freely; that is, the energy barrier between the two isomers is not too high. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is considered a rearrangement reaction.  - In chemistry, bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") is the measure of bond strength in a chemical bond. IUPAC defines bond energy as the average value of the gas-phase bond dissociation energies (usually at a temperature of 298 K) for all bonds of the same type within the same chemical species. For example, the carbonhydrogen bond energy in methane \\"H\\"(CH) is the enthalpy change involved with breaking up one molecule of methane into a carbon atom and four hydrogen radicals, divided by 4. Tabulated bond energies are generally values of bond energies averaged over a number of selected typical chemical species containing that type of bond. Bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") should not be confused with bond-dissociation energy. Bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies in a molecule, and will show a different value for a given bond than the bond-dissociation energy would. This is because the energy required to break a single bond in a specific molecule differs for each bond in that molecule. For example, methane has four CH bonds and the bond-dissociation energies are 435 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH) and 339 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CH). Their average, and hence the bond energy, is 414 kJ/mol, even though not a single bond required specifically 414 kJ/mol to be broken.  - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.  - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion.  - In chemistry , photoisomerization is molecular behavior in which structural change between isomers is caused by photoexcitation . Both reversible and irreversible isomerization reactions exist . However , the word \`\` photoisomerization '' usually indicates a reversible process .  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - An isomer (from Greek , isomerès; isos = \\"equal\\", méros = \\"part\\") is a molecule with the same molecular formula as another molecule, but with a different chemical structure. That is, isomers contain the same number of atoms of each element, but have different arrangements of their atoms. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups. There are two main forms of isomerism (or ): structural isomerism (or constitutional isomerism) and stereoisomerism (or spatial isomerism).  - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number.  - A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2:  - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur.  - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces  the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.

I never really thought anything of it as instructors would often pull guys aside for reviews, specific instructions or taskings. I don’t know how much time passed but the candidate walked back in. He gathered his things and left the room. Guys asked if everything was cool but he didn’t say a word. The instructor came in and sat on the desk at the front of the room. We asked if everything was alright, and he told us that the day prior, the The candidate’s wife had gone into labor however there were complications with the baby but the complications were unknown. He was reporting to the commander to let him know whether he wanted to stay in training or leave because the military does not consider a spouse’s pregnancy to be an emergency even though the complication should be. If he were to leave he would have to drop from the TACP pipeline with a possibility of either starting it over from the beginning of quitting all together.

The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Please answer this question : In which region the plates would move, region A or region B? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the given information step by step and analyze it. 1. Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. 2. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. 3. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. 4. As the plates move, stresses build. 5. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. 6. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. Now, we know that Region A experiences many earthquakes, while Region B experiences none. Based on the information provided, we can infer the following: Since almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and Region A experiences many earthquakes, it is likely that Region A is located along an active plate boundary. On the other hand, Region B experiences no earthquakes, which means it is likely not located along an active plate boundary where plates are moving. Therefore, in answering the question, the plates would move in Region A due to its location along an active plate boundary where earthquakes occur, while in Region B the plates are less likely to move due to its lack of earthquake activity."},{"instruction":"Who does the student, whose huband committed suicide, live with?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant.

Context: Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts. A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century. Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy.

What league will be bringing an expansion team in 2021 to the city that once housed the Seattle Supersonics?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Seattle was awarded a Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969. The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001.

Information:  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content  including match outcomes  is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\".  - Jerry W. Jarrett Sr. (born September 4, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee) is an American promoter and former professional wrestler, and the father of wrestler Jeff Jarrett. He is the co-founder and former part-owner of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Like World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, Jarrett was initially a promoter and became a wrestler later in life.  - The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in the late 1950s.  - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.  - Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character also known as a \`\` gimmick '' that was originally introduced in Memphis ' Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) in 1984 . The character was based on a gang leader called \`\` the Humungus '' or at times \`\` Lord Humungus '' from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior . The original Lord Humongous was portrayed by Mike Stark , who was tall and physically impressive like the character in the movie . Since Lord Humongous always wears a Hockey mask it allowed promoters to replace the man under the mask without having to publicly acknowledge that it was someone else playing the part . The character became a recurring gimmick on the CWA but was also used in other promotions after the CWA closed . The character has been played by a number of wrestlers including Jeff Van Kamp , Sid Vicious and Barry Buchanan and Sid 's son Gunnar Eudy .  - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring.  - The United States Wrestling Association or USWA was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Wrestling Association.  - The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is a professional wrestling governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA championship bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional \\"territory\\" system.  - Continental Wrestling Association (later on Championship Wrestling Association) was a wrestling promotion managed by Jerry Jarrett. The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity.  - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state.  - Jeff VanCamp, Sr. is an American retired professional wrestler, who wrestled under the ring names Jeff Van Kamp/Jeff Van Camp as well as working as Lord Humongous in 1984 and 1985. He is a former NWA Alabama Heavyweight Champion and NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Champion.  - Catch wrestling is a classical hybrid grappling style that was developed in Britain circa 1870 by J. G. Chambers, then later refined and popularised by the wrestlers of travelling funfairs who developed their own submission holds, or \\"hooks\\", into their wrestling to increase their effectiveness against their opponents. Catch wrestling derives from a number of different styles, the English styles of Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, Cornwall and Devon wrestling, Lancashire wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, styles of the Indian subcontinent such as Pehlwani, Jujutsu and Iranian styles such as Varzesh-e Pahlavani. The training of some modern submission wrestlers, professional wrestlers and mixed martial artists is founded in catch wrestling.  - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.

Donald Christopher Barber (born 17 April 1930) is an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and trombonist. As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. Barber and Monty Sunshine (clarinet) formed a band in 1953, calling it Ken Colyer's Jazzmen to capitalise on their trumpeter's recent escapades in New Orleans: the group also included Donegan, Jim Bray (bass), Ron Bowden (drums) and Barber on trombone. The band played Dixieland jazz, and later ragtime, swing, blues and R&B. Pat Halcox took over on trumpet in 1954 when Colyer moved on after musical differences and the band became \\"The Chris Barber Band\\".  In April 1953 the band made its debut in Copenhagen, Denmark. There Chris Albertson recorded several sides for the new Danish Storyville label, including some featuring only Sunshine, Donegan and Barber on double bass. In 1959 the band's version of Sidney Bechet's \\"Petite Fleur\\", a clarinet solo by Monty Sunshine with Barber on string bass, spent twenty-four weeks in the UK Singles Charts, making it to No. 3 and selling over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. After 1959 he toured the United States many times (where \\"Petite Fleur\\" charted at #5).  In the late 1950s and early 1960s Barber was mainly responsible for arranging the first UK tours of blues artists Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters. This, with the encouragement of local enthusiasts such as Alexis Korner and John Mayall, sparked young musicians such as Peter Green, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. British rhythm and blues powered the British invasion of the USA charts in the 1960s, yet Dixieland itself remained popular: in January 1963 the British music magazine, NME reported the biggest trad jazz event in Britain at Alexandra Palace. It included George Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Alex Welsh, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Barber.  Barber stunned traditionalists in 1964 by introducing blues guitarist John Slaughter into the line up who, apart from a break between April 1978 and August 1986, when Roger Hill took over the spot, played in the band until shortly before his death in 2010. Barber next added a second clarinet/saxophone and this line-up continued until 1999. Then Barber added fellow trombonist/arranger Bob Hunt and another clarinet and trumpet. This eleven-man \\"Big Chris Barber Band\\" offered a broader range of music while reserving a spot in the programme for the traditional six-man New Orleans line-up.  A recording of the Lennon-McCartney composition \\"Catswalk\\" can be heard, retitled \\"Cat Call\\", on The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away.

We have the equation 2400 = -120 * s, and what we need to do is get 's' by itself on one side of the equation.

PUBLISHED:. 09:02 EST, 2 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:17 EST, 2 October 2013. Still missing: The 1988 case of missing Pinole, California girl Amber Swartz-Garcia was reopened Tuesday. Police in Northern California reopened on Tuesday the case of a 7-year-old girl who vanished from her family’s front yard 25 years ago. Amber Swartz-Garcia hasn’t been seen by her Pinole, California family since 1988, but officials bowed to pressure from her mother and local community members Tuesday by agreeing to reopen the case in order to use improved forensic technology. This, despite a 2009 confession to the girl’s murder by known area child killer Curtis Dean Anderson. Though her case had been subsequently closed, not everyone believed Anderson. ‘I think he wanted to make a name for himself and get off of death row,’ Amber’s mother Kim Swartz told KTVU. Swartz was joined by 1,300 others who signed a petition to get the case reopened. The announcement was made Tuesday night at a Pinole City Council meeting. ‘The. bottom line is Amber wasn't found and we want to make sure we do. everything we can to locate her,’ Police Chief John Hardester said. Meanwhile,. Hardester was clear that there is no new evidence in the case and that. Anderson, who died just a month after his confession, has not been. cleared in the case. Then and now: Amber was 7-years-old when she disappeared from her family's front yard in June of 1988. She has been missing since. Age progression technology was used to what Amber might look like now, in her early 30s. Murderer? The case was reopened despite a 2007 confession from known child killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who said he drove Amber to Arizona, killed her, and buried her body near a highway. Doubt: Anderson died just a month after he confessed to murdering Amber and police say they were unable to 're-interview' him regarding his crimes. Swartz was still buoyed by the new turn in her young daughter’s tragic case. ‘I'm totally excited,’ Swartz said before a cheering crowd. ‘Like maybe my days of running into brick walls is over with.’ The FBI offered Pinole police the use of their forensic labs in order to expedite the investigation. 'It is hoped that opening the case will encourage information exchange regarding the case,' police said in a statement, 'and to generate information that might lead to the recovery of Amber Swartz.' 'I'm totally excited': Amber's mother Kim Swartz was joined by 1300 people who sign a petition to get her daughter's case reopened. Good and bad: Community members cheered the announcement from Pinole Police Chief John Hardester, who maintained nonetheless that no new evidence has been uncovered to refute Anderson's confession. Anderson. told authorities that he forcibly took Amber from in front of her home. in 1988 and eventually killed and buried her in Arizona. Amber's body has never been located. His death came, according to police, before he could be 're-interviewed' regarding his confession. Amber. is among eight females Anderson was convicted of kidnapping and. murdering, including the most recent victim Xiana Fairchild. Fairchild. disappeared December 9, 1999. Despite. his death and confessions, the FBI is still ‘seeking the public’s. assistance in identifying alleged victims’ of Anderson’s. Serial killer: Curtis Dean Anderson had confessed to at least eight murders when he died in 2007. Police were subsequently unable to interview him further. Now family and supporters of Kim Swartz say they have room to doubt his confession. Curtis Dean Anderson was sitting on death row at California's Corcoran State Prison when he confessed to the murder of 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia. He told police in 2007 that he forcibly took the girl and drove to Arizona, where he said killed and buried her along a highway in the town of Benson. One month after his confession, on December 9, 2007, Anderson died before police were able to 're-interview' him regarding his confession. The Swartz-Garcia case was closed in 2009. Her body has yet to be recovered. Anderson's most recent known murder was of a 7-year-old Vallejo, California girl named Xiana Fairchild in 1999, for which he was sentenced to 300 years in prison. The killer confessed to at least eight murders, though most of his victims--all of them female--remain unidentified. Nearly all were in or near the San Francisco Bay area beginning with the murder of a Marysville woman in her late teens or early 20s in 1984. Anderson admitted to two other murders in Mexico, but did not provide details. Despite his confessions and the time since the murders, the FBI website still says the agnecy is 'seeking the public’s assistance in identifying alleged victims of convicted killer Curtis Dean Anderson.' Anderson was first captured after one of his kidnapping victims was able to escape.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  and the situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  Answer the following question: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","output":"Chris's cup of water is more dense.  In the given background, it is mentioned that the density of liquid water increases as its temperature decreases, and water reaches its highest density at about 4°C. As water cools, the molecules move closer together, which makes it more dense.  Steve requests water with molecules far apart, which implies a lower density due to greater distance between the water molecules. This can be achieved when the water is warmer, as the increase in temperature results in a lower density.  On the other hand, Chris orders water with molecules closer together. This implies that he wants a denser water, and the molecules in liquid water are closest together at about 4°C. At this temperature, the liquid water has reached its highest density. Therefore, Chris's cup of water, with molecules closer together, is more dense than Steve's cup of water with molecules far apart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Zoo elephants don't live as long as those in the wild, according to a study sure to cause debate about keeping the giant animals on display. Researchers compared the life spans of elephants in European zoos with those living in Amboseli National Park in Kenya and others working on a timber enterprise in Buma. Animals in the wild or in natural working conditions had life expectancies twice than or more of their relatives in zoos. Animal care activists have urged in recent years to discourage keeping elephants in zoos, largely because of the lack of space and small numbers of animals that can be kept in a group. The researchers found that the _ life span for African elephants in European zoos was 16.9 years, compared with 56 years for elephants who died of natural causes in Kenya's Amboseli Park. Adding in those elephants killed by people in Africa lowered the median life expectancy there to 35.9 years. For the more endangered Asian elephants, the median life span in European zoos was 18.9 years, compared with 41.7 years for those working in the Burma Timber Enterprise. Median means half died younger than that age and half lived longer. There is some good news, though.

A:","output":"The purpose of the invention is to improve the supply of forces acting during the expansion time on the piston of an internal combustion engine, to improve the course of the torque, and at the same time to eliminate the danger of damaging the mechanical parts of the engine during knocking and self-ignition, or possibly reducing the requirements for the anti-detonation properties of the fuel. This purpose is achieved by installing an eccentric bearing insert equipped with a centrifugal counterweight on the connecting rod pin of the crankshaft. The position of the eccentric insert relative to the crankshaft is controlled by centrifugal and inertial forces acting on the lower head of the connecting rod, the centrifugal counterweight, and on the connecting rod and piston, depending on the instantaneous pressure of the gases above the piston, engine mode, number of revolutions, etc. The eccentric bearing insert may be provided with needle bearing elements on both the outer and inner sliding surfaces. The device works such that after ignition of the combustible mixture, the connecting rod pressure rotates the eccentric bearing insert together with the counterweight approximately 180° before reaching the upper culminating point of the connecting rod pin. At the moment of stopping the movement of the eccentric insert relative to the connecting rod pin, influenced by the continuing pressure of the connecting rod, the entire system acts with a torque force tangentially along the circumference described by the connecting rod pin, thereby improving the engine's torque."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael van Praag will challenge Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency. Van Praag announced the news Monday on Dutch FA's website. Van Praag believes 'no credible' candidate has emerged to oppose Blatter. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Michael van Praag Announces Challenge to Sepp Blatter's FIFA Presidency Introduction: Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag, has announced his intention to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. In a statement released on the Dutch FA's website on Monday, van Praag highlighted his belief that there is currently no credible candidate to oppose Blatter. Step 1: Describe Michael van Praag's background and qualifications As a respected figure in European football, Michael van Praag has a wealth of experience to draw upon. He has served as the president of the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) since 2008 and has been a member of the UEFA Executive Committee since 2009. With a long history in football administration and governance, van Praag is well-equipped to understand the challenges faced by FIFA and propose potential solutions. Step 2: Discuss the motivation behind van Praag's challenge Michael van Praag's decision to challenge Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency stems from his belief that the current field of candidates is not sufficiently credible to bring about much-needed change in the organization. By putting his own name forward, van Praag aims to create a more competitive race and offer an alternative vision for the future of FIFA. Step 3: Examine the issues surrounding FIFA and Sepp Blatter's presidency Sepp Blatter has served as FIFA president since 1998, but his reign has been mired in controversy with allegations of corruption and poor governance. Critics argue that FIFA lacks transparency and needs a complete overhaul to restore its image and credibility. By challenging Blatter's presidency, van Praag hopes to address these issues and usher in a new era of ethical leadership for FIFA. Step 4: Consider the possibility of success for van Praag's challenge While there is no doubt that Michael van Praag is a credible candidate for FIFA's presidency, the outcome of this challenge remains uncertain. Sepp Blatter continues to have a strong base of support despite the controversies, and it will be an uphill battle for any challenger to unseat him. Nonetheless, van Praag's challenge signifies a growing dissatisfaction with FIFA's current leadership and may inspire other potential candidates to join the race. Conclusion: Michael van Praag's announcement to challenge Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency is undoubtedly a bold move. As a respected figure in European football, van Praag offers an alternative vision for the organization's future. Whether his challenge will lead to a change in leadership remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a growing desire for a more transparent, accountable, and ethical FIFA."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Context: King Ottokar II of Bohemia improved fortifications and rebuilt the royal palace for the purposes of representation and housing. In the 14th century, under the reign of Charles IV the royal palace was rebuilt in Gothic style and the castle fortifications were strengthened. In place of rotunda and basilica of St. Vitus began building of a vast Gothic church, that were completed almost six centuries later. During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall  was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle. A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited. The Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle and began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from  the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague  which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War. The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century. Following his abdication in 1848, and the succession of his nephew, Franz Joseph, to the throne, the former emperor, Ferdinand I, made Prague Castle his home. Question: How many years after King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuilt the castle did the castle experience a large fire? Answer:","output":"The large fire occurred in 1541. King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle in 1485.

Write a summary based on this article: ST. LOUIS COUNTY • A grand jury member’s lawsuit seeking a court order to speak out about the Michael Brown shooting investigation accuses Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch of publicly misrepresenting the panel’s viewpoint after it chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson.      In documents filed Monday in federal court in St. Louis, “Grand Juror Doe” wants freedom to challenge McCulloch’s comments, “especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.”      The filing says that the heavily redacted grand jury documents McCulloch released Nov. 24 “do not fully portray the proceedings before the grand jury.” McCulloch spoke publicly that night about the grand jury’s decision against charging Wilson.      Ferguson erupted in protests, including arsons that burned about a score of buildings within hours.      A spokesman for McCulloch declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday.      The suit says that speaking publicly could “contribute to the current public dialogue concerning race relations” that was sparked by the shooting Aug. 9 of the black teen by Wilson, a white officer.      Doe also wants “to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri,” the suit says, and be able to talk about the case “with close family members at home.”      The plaintiff invokes free speech rights in asking the court to overrule as unconstitutional a Missouri law that makes it a misdemeanor for grand jurors to discuss at least certain parts of their work, including what was said in deliberations and what was the jury’s vote. The suit also seeks an order to prevent McCulloch from prosecuting the juror for making public remarks.      A grand jury does not decide guilt but whether there is sufficient evidence for a trial. In Missouri, an indictment requires the vote of nine of the 12 members. That means at least four of these grand jurors did not support charges for Wilson.      The suit says McCulloch’s characterization was at odds with Doe’s opinions, and that the public’s understanding of the grand jurors’ views is “not entirely accurate.”      The investigation of Wilson “had a stronger focus on the victim than in other grand jury cases,” the suit says. The presentation of evidence and “the State’s counsel to the grand jury” had “differed markedly and in significant ways ... from the hundreds of matters presented to the grand jury earlier in its term.”      The suit also claims the legal guidelines presented to jurors in applying facts of the case were “muddled and untimely” compared to other cases.      The plaintiff is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the law firm of Sowers & Wolf, in Town and Country.      “The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance,” Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, said in a prepared statement. “The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a lifetime gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.”      Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the ACLU, told the Post-Dispatch that the public is entitled to “complete information not controlled by the government.”      Mittman would not tell Doe’s gender, whether Doe’s opinions are shared by other grand jurors or whether the suit might prompt other jurors to come forward. “This grand juror is being very respectful of the legal process and does not want to share information that it is not legally permissible to share,” he said.      One reason the grand jury process is secret is to protect the target if an indictment is not returned, Mittman said. Wilson’s name, of course, is known nationally.      Mae Quinn, a Washington University law professor and director of the Juvenile Law and Justice Clinic, said she is not familiar with any similar litigation.      “This lawsuit does not surprise me,” she said. “Each time we have heard from the prosecutor, referencing the thinking, the analysis and, essentially, the deliberations of the grand jurors, has raised questions in my mind about when these jurors would be permitted to speak for themselves. And while our statutory scheme does criminalize certain public statements by grand jurors, it does seem that those provisions do need to give way at some point, when someone is ... offering statements on their behalf.”      In support for their suit, the lawyers cite a unanimous 1990 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said that many of the reasons for maintaining grand jury secrecy disappear when an investigation concludes. But the underlying lawsuit in that case was filed by a Florida newspaper reporter who wanted to report on his own testimony in front of a grand jury, not by a juror.      Justice Antonin Scalia warned in a separate opinion that subjecting a grand jury to scrutiny by the press and public “might in the long run deter citizens from fearless performance of their grand jury service.”      Separately on Monday, a group of Missouri residents, including Christi Griffin, founder of the Ethics Project, faxed a misconduct complaint against McCulloch and the two prosecutors who handled the case to Missouri’s Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel.      Among other things, the complaint alleges that prosecutors presented an outdated statute for grand jurors to consider and witness testimony that they knew to be false, released grand jury transcripts without the consent of the state or federal government, erred in delaying the announcement of the decision until 8 p.m. on Nov. 24 and skewed the presentation of evidence and testimony to favor Wilson.      In addition, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund on Monday asked Judge Maura McShane, the presiding judge of the 21st Judicial Circuit in Missouri, for “an immediate and thorough investigation of the grand jury proceedings.”      “The transcripts of the grand jury proceedings reveal questionable prosecutorial tactics that compromised the integrity of the proceedings,” a letter sent by the group to McShane said. “As a result, we are asking the court to restore public confidence in the St. Louis County justice system by conducting an investigation, convening a new grand jury, and appointing a special prosecutor pursuant to Missouri law.” ||||| Share      Seeks to Participate in Public Discussion of Ferguson Events      January 5, 2015      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      CONTACT: 212-549-2666, media@aclu.org      ST. LOUIS – Grand Juror Doe, who served on the grand jury which investigated the killing of Michael Brown by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, is suing Robert McCulloch, prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County. Doe would like to talk about the experience of serving on a grand jury, the evidence presented and the investigation in a way that could contribute to the public dialogue concerning race relations.      The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri is representing Grand Juror Doe because, without permission from a court, it is a crime for grand jurors to discuss their service. McCulloch is named as a defendant since he would be the person to bring charges against Doe.      “The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror’s First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis,” explains Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri. “The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance. The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a life-time gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.”      “Grand Juror Doe’s perspective can and should help inform a way forward here in Missouri,” says Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the ACLU of Missouri. “The ACLU will fight to allow this important voice to be heard by the public and lawmakers so that we can begin the healing process that can only result from fact-based reforms.”      Cooperating attorneys on this case are Eric Sowers, Ferne Wolf and Joshua Pierson, from Sowers & Wolf Attorneys at Law. A copy of the complaint can be found on the ACLU of Missouri website.      The ACLU of Missouri is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization that defends and expands the constitutional rights and civil liberties of all Missourians guaranteed under the United States and Missouri Constitutions, through its litigation, legislative and public education programs. It is an affiliate of the national ACLU. ||||| (Updated 11:30 a.m., Tuesday, Jan. 6 with NAACP's request for an investigation.)      A grand juror is suing St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch in an effort to speak out on what happened in the Darren Wilson case. Under typical circumstances, grand jurors are prohibited by law from discussing cases they were involved in.      The grand juror, referred to only as \\"Grand Juror Doe\\" in the lawsuit, takes issue with how McCulloch characterized the case. McCulloch released evidence presented to the grand jury and publicly discussed the case after the grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, then a Ferguson police officer, in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American.      “In [the grand juror]’s view, the current information available about the grand jurors’ views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges,” the lawsuit says. (A grand jury's decision does not have to be unanimous.)      “Moreover, the public characterization of the grand jurors’ view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with [Doe]’s own,” the lawsuit continued. “From [the grand juror]’s perspective, the investigation of Wilson had a stronger focus on the victim than in other cases presented to the grand jury.” Doe also believes the legal standards were conveyed in a “muddled” and “untimely” manner to the grand jury.      In the lawsuit filed Monday in federal court, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri argues that this case is unique and that the usual reasons for requiring the jurors to maintain secrecy should not apply.      In this specific case, “any interests furthered by maintaining grand jury secrecy are outweighed by the interests secured by the First Amendment,” the lawsuit says, adding that allowing the juror to speak would contribute to a discussion on race in America.      As the grand juror points out in the lawsuit, the Wilson case was handled in a very different manner than other grand juries. Instead of recommending a charge, McCulloch's office presented thousands of pages worth of evidence and testimony before the grand jury. At one point, McCulloch's spokesman characterized the grand jury as co-investigators.      “From [Doe]’s perspective, although the release of a large number of records provides an appearance of transparency, with heavy redactions and the absence of context, those records do not fully portray the proceedings before the grand jury,” the lawsuit says.      McCulloch has done several interviews since the grand jury decision was announced on Nov. 24, but the grand jurors have been prohibited from speaking about the case. The county prosecutor admits that some of the witnesses were lying, but said the grand jurors were aware.      The 12 people who could say for sure are currently sworn to secrecy.      Although the county released redacted transcripts of witness and expert testimony, the grand jurors deliberated without a court reporter or member of the prosecutor’s office present.      State law says that grand jurors shall not “disclose any evidence given” nor “the name of any witness who appeared before them,” adding that any juror who violates that is guilty of a misdemeanor. The ACLU is asking a judge to grant an injunction that prohibits enforcing those laws (or threatening to) in this case.      The laws “prevent [the grand juror] from discussing truthful information about a matter of public significance,” the lawsuit says. “As applied in the circumstances of this case, the challenged laws act as a prior restraint on [Doe’s] expressive activity.”      McCulloch's office declined to comment.      Late Monday, the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund requested an investigation of the conduct of McCulloch's office.      “Our review of these proceedings has raised grave legal concerns, including knowing presentation of false witness testimony, erroneous instructions on the law, and preferential treatment of Mr. Wilson by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office,\\" Sherrilyn Ifill, LDF’s president said in a written statement.

Sentence 2: He does not care how he makes his money. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPT: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","output":"If we carefully consider the information provided in Sentence 1, it is clear that we cannot necessarily infer that Sentence 2 is true. This leads us to answer (ii) it is not possible to tell.  To elaborate, Sentence 1 claims that Toobin is being hypocritical due to his profiting from enclosing his reporting in hard covers. This suggests that he may have criticized others for doing the same thing and is now engaging in the same behavior. However, this specific situation does not provide enough information to determine Toobin's overall motivation or criteria for making money. Sentence 2 makes a broader claim about Toobin's attitude towards making money, stating that he does not care how he makes it. While it might be tempting to interpret his hypocritical action from Sentence 1 as evidence for this claim, it does not lead to a definitive conclusion about his underlying motivations. It is possible that there are other factors at play, or that Toobin's behavior in this particular instance is not reflective of his general attitude towards making money. In conclusion, based solely on the information available in Sentence 1, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sentence 2 is true or not.

Translate this to English?","output":"The sentence you provided is in German and it translates to English as follows: During check-in, you must declare that your weapon(s) is/are unloaded and that the ammunition is packaged separately. This statement usually refers to airline travel policies concerning firearms and ammunition. Passengers who are permitted to carry firearms for certain reasons, such as sport shooting or hunting, must comply with strict security measures. This includes making sure the firearm is unloaded before check-in. Firearms are to be packed in a sturdy checked bag. The ammunition also needs to be stored in a separated way to prevent accidental discharge of the weapon. Usually, it should be packed in a container designed specifically for the purpose, such as the original packaging from the manufacturer, or other hard-shell container. In addition, the amount of ammunition one can carry may be limited due to safety reasons. Moreover, in many jurisdictions, passengers must declare at check-in that they are transporting firearm(s) and ammunition in their checked baggage. This declaration usually involves filling in a form, stating the firearm is unloaded and ammunition is stored properly. Keep in mind, this is the typical regulation, however, depending on the country or the specific airline, there might be slightly different rules.

To do this, let's add 60 to both sides of the equation: 60 = 20 * f Finally, we need to divide both sides by 20 to get 'f' by itself: 60 / 20 = f f = 3 So, the value of 'f' in this equation is 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While that last comparison is still being bandied about -- for better or for worse -- today there is more buzz about \\"will she stay clean?\\" and \\"can she stay out of trouble?\\" than her talent. Lohan's latest 90-day rehab stint, which ended this week, was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. Lindsay Lohan the actress seems to have been replaced by Lindsay Lohan the perpetual comeback kid. \\"I think Lohan has more natural acting talent than Monroe did, but, like OPTIONS: - Ann-Margret, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - CNN, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Canyons, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Elizabeth Taylor, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Lindsay Lohan, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Lohan, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Marilyn Monroe, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote.","output":"\\"Marilyn Monroe, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. This complements the beginning of the paragraph, where Lohan's acting abilities are compared to those of Ann-Margret, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn Monroe. This cue gives suitable context for making a direct comparison between Lohan and Monroe. Besides, the attribution to \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" creates a stronger emotional punch, given Monroe's iconic status and persistent legacy that's associated with both talent and personal struggles. Also, considering Monroe as an epitome of the quintessential Hollywood tragedy, the comparison accentuates Lohan's susceptibility to similar pitfalls. Moreover, by suggesting that Lohan's natural acting talent surpasses Monroe's, but her inability to \\"fake\\" it—presumably meaning feigning emotions convincingly, sustaining a facade or navigating the unscripted aspects of being a public figure, the remark could either be seen as a critique of her performance skills or a commentary on her life off-camera. This layered comparison indicates that like Monroe, Lohan's personal life and struggles have overshadowed her professional talent, drawing more attention to her off-screen exploits than her on-screen performances. Such a comparison also reflects the media's fascination with the tragic aspects of fame, which has been highlighted in Monroe's case. It seems to assert that there are parallel streaks of talent and self-destruction with both stars. It works to underline the tragic potential of a career in Hollywood, where immense talent often finds itself in a constant tussle with personal demons. This comparison reasserts the impact of Monroe's persona in shaping public memory and how those who follow can often find themselves caught in the same net of judgement, expectation, and tragedy."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

While Iraq's growing maritime force is a visible sign of its resolve to strengthen national security and protect the nation's territorial waters, it is evident that building a formidable naval force will require considerable time and effort. Trainers and experts caution against expecting immediate results, highlighting the importance of patience, support, and steady progress in bolstering the country's seafaring capabilities. Transitioning from a traditional land-based focus in military operations, Iraq is gradually realizing the significance of possessing a functional and equipped navy. The naval force bears the crucial responsibility of defending the country's coastline, securing its economic interests in the maritime sphere, and ensuring the safe passage of trade, resources, and personnel through nearby waters. Despite the countless challenges that building Iraq's burgeoning navy entails, the progress made thus far is a testimony to the perseverance and cooperation of the nation's military personnel and authorities. Several international partners have committed to helping Iraq establish its naval force by providing resources, training, and expertise. However, it is essential to acknowledge and manage expectations about the time and investment required to develop a robust and competent force capable of effectively securing Iraq's maritime interests. Training and education prove vital to developing any military force, and the Iraqi Navy is no exception. The current generation of naval officers has shown impressive determination and adaptability in embracing this new arena of warfare. Nevertheless, trainers emphasize that it takes time to grow in ranks and experience, which are crucial points in becoming proficient and tactical in command. Building a competent naval force also hinges on the acquisition and deployment of suitable vessels, equipment, and technology. Iraq's Navy requires adequate tools and resources to carry out its mission of protecting territorial waters and ensuring maritime security, but procuring and maintaining these assets demands time, financial investment, and expertise. Furthermore, the expansion and empowerment of Iraq's naval force demand the fostering of cooperation between different branches of the country's military. Sharing intelligence, coordinating operations, and leveraging the strengths of each branch will be required to tackle complex challenges and potential threats such collaborations could entail. Iraq's recent history has left the nation's military forces primarily focused on ground-based battles and counter-insurgency operations. The shift towards establishing a viable naval force may spark concerns about the possibility of detracting resources from the continued fight against insurgency on land. However, investing in a strong and versatile navy will contribute to the long-term security and wellbeing of the nation. In conclusion, rebuilding the Iraqi Navy is a significant and necessary endeavor that will demand time, investment, and patience. As trainers emphasize, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will the capabilities and proficiency of Iraq's naval force. The nation's efforts to test its sea legs should be lauded and supported and, with realistic expectations and proper investment, the Iraqi Navy will undoubtedly grow in strength and effectiveness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Dean \\"Deano\\" Butterworth is a British-American drummer who is noted for working with English singer Morrissey, and in 2005 became the drummer for American band Good Charlotte after they parted with their previous drummer, Chris Wilson.  - Eric Dodd, known professionally as Eric Valentine, is an American record producer, who began his career as drummer and producer in the heavy metal band T-Ride.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.  - Good Morning Revival is the fourth studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte and the follow-up to the 2004 release \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\". It is the first album to feature Dean Butterworth on drums, who joined the band in March 2005 after former drummer Chris Wilson departed in 2005. Billy Martin has mentioned in an interview that Benji Madden came up with the name for the album. This style can be heard in the album's third single, \\"Dance Floor Anthem\\", which is the most successful song on the album by debuting at No. 2 on the Australian charts and reaching No.25 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. It is the final album by Good Charlotte to be released through Daylight Records; they subsequently signed a deal with Capitol.  - \`\` The Anthem '' is a song recorded by American pop punk group Good Charlotte .

Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - Joel Rueben Madden (born Joel Rueben Combs; March 11, 1979) is the lead vocalist for the American pop punk band Good Charlotte, as well as a record producer, actor, DJ, and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

In the given statement, the phrase \\"Blue is not entitled\\" emphasizes that the subject 'Blue' does not hold any specific right or claim for any form of compensation or reimbursement, which could be in the form of financial, emotional, or social aspects, etc. The term \\"entitled\\" suggests that there is no inherent privilege or legal standing which justifies 'Blue' to receive any form of redress or aid from others. On the other hand, the term \\"redress\\" fundamentally refers to the process of rectifying or remedying a particular wrong, injustice, or grievance. The concept of redress can be applied to an array of contexts, including interpersonal relationships, legal disputes, and societal injustices, among others. In light of this, the notion of entitlement to redress essentially revolves around one's eligibility or right to expect any kind of remedy, assistance, or intervention to address their grievances. Considering these terms collectively, the given statement, \\"Blue is not entitled to redress,\\" underscores the idea that 'Blue' presently does not possess any intrinsic right or claim to seek any compensation, aid, or rectification for their grievances or plights.

This is a staggering amount of money spent on a condition largely caused by our lifestyle choices and environment. On Doctor in the House, I try to help 39-year-old La-Vern. Her mother, Doreen, already has type 2 diabetes and is worried that La-Vern is going down the same route. La-Vern is a busy, single mother who does two jobs and, as a result, is exhausted and stressed. She has not yet crossed our diagnostic threshold where we would say she has type 2 diabetes, but her blood sugar and fasting insulin levels are not \\"normal\\" either.  Her results suggested that she was on the road towards type 2 diabetes. This is an ideal opportunity to practise true preventive medicine. Type 2 diabetes is a late event. By the time you get a diagnosis, things will have been going wrong in your body for many years. La-Vern's symptoms of fatigue have already affected her quality of life. However, her lifestyle is not only causing her to feel unwell, but is driving her towards a type 2 diabetes diagnosis further down the line. This is one of the big problems in medicine today - things are often said to be black or white, normal or abnormal - but what about optimal? I am an advocate for trying to recognise problems before they happen. Why should we wait for people to get a type 2 diabetes diagnosis before we take action? Type 2 diabetes is often viewed as a dietary illness. That is partially true as diet is a big contributor. However, other lifestyle factors such as insufficient sleep, long-term stress, and inappropriate physical activity all contribute, as well. For many of my patients, addressing these factors can be as important as their food choices. Most cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin is an important hormone and one of its functions is to keep your blood sugar tightly controlled. If you are in optimal health and not insulin resistant, a sugary bowl of breakfast cereal will cause your blood sugar to go up. Your body will then release a little bit of insulin to bring it back down again. As your health deteriorates and you start to become insulin-resistant, you need more and more insulin to keep your blood sugar under control. Your body has become deaf to insulin's sound. It is a little bit like alcohol - the very first time you have a drink, it may only take a few sips of wine to feel tipsy but as you become accustomed to drinking more and more, you need more and more alcohol to have the same effect - your body has become resistant to the effects of the alcohol. This is similar to what happens in insulin resistance. This raised level of insulin can itself cause many problems. And when the insulin can no longer keep your blood sugar under control - at that point, we give you a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. As I explained in a TED talk, there is a problem with blood sugar in type 2 diabetes, but it is not a blood sugar problem. By the time your blood sugar goes into the diabetic range, things have been going wrong in your body for many years. The four areas of treatment I focused on with La-Vern are the same four areas I look at with almost all of my patients: food, movement, stress and sleep. Problems in these areas can all contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Food The main change I made with La-Vern's diet was to cut out highly processed junk food. Because of her insulin resistance, she was unable to efficiently process foods that quickly converted to sugar in her body, so I advised her to eliminate refined carbohydrates in her diet such as sugary breakfast cereals, white rice and bread. I encouraged her to increase her intake of healthy, natural fats such as avocados, nuts, and olives as well as healthy protein sources such as salmon and anchovies. Sleep La-Vern had trouble sleeping and this was contributing to her exhaustion. However, sleep deprivation can also cause insulin resistance. Like many of us, La-Vern was glued to her smartphone every evening. This late-night usage can cause major sleep issues. There are two main reasons for this: I advised La-Vern to switch off all electronic screens at least one hour before going to bed. I also gave her some amber glasses to wear in the evening to reduce the amount of blue light hitting her eyes. These small changes had an immediate impact - her sleep improved and her energy levels increased. 3. Exercise and stress La-Vern is a very typical case of what I see in my practice. She's extremely busy - a single mother working two jobs and highly stressed. I explained to La-Vern how her energy reserve is a bit like a bank account - you cannot keep making withdrawals without going into overdraft. She had very little energy reserve left with the demands of being a single mum, her two jobs and lack of sleep. Whatever time she did have left, she spent going to the gym three times per week for an intense one-hour workout session, which left her feeling drained. La-Vern was simply doing too much and her exercise regime was actually putting more stress on her body. This is a common problem these days - we have been conditioned to think that more exercise is always better. I persuaded La-Vern to swap these intense workouts for yoga, a more restorative practice. This was life-changing. At the end of her yoga session, La-Vern not only felt as though she had worked out but also felt rejuvenated and energised. Plus, it was the only \\"switch off\\" time she had all week. By addressing these four areas of health - food, movement, sleep and stress - I not only helped La-Vern feel significantly better, but, just as importantly, I've reduced her risk of following her mother down the road towards type 2 diabetes. La-Vern is unstinting in her praise of Dr Chatterjee. She says he \\"saved\\" her life. She adds: \\"[That's} a profound statement I know; however he came into our lives at such a crucial time. By sharing his knowledge he has given me, my mum and my family the tools to implement very subtle changes that have literally turned our lives around. \\"As humans we take certain things for granted but do we realise how such things like stress, the food we eat and a lack of sleep, the quality of the sleep actually has such a detrimental impact on the way we think, our overall health and general well-being? Until now, I certainly did not. \\"Our lack of understanding meant we were tackling aspects of our lives and health believing it was for the best when in fact we were doing more harm than good. With the benefit of hindsight, this is quite a scary concept. \\"We felt truly blessed to have had the opportunity to have Dr Chatterjee in our lives. He is a very wise, caring and such a genuine person and we are so grateful to him for helping us to bring about changes that are having such a positive impact.\\" Too much of our focus in medicine is reactive and treatment kicks in only once you have a disease. If there is any hope of saving our NHS, we have to be much more proactive at recognising and treating problems early on. The future of healthcare needs to be preventive and personalised. It's what I call progressive medicine, and there is an ever-growing need for us to practise it right now. Type 2 diabetes: a real need for preventive medicine.

Q:What is the answer for the question: In what year was forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments reportedly closed in Galveston? from the following article ?  During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed.  Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S. Maceo, nephew of Sam and Rose, claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it. A:","output":"The answer to the question is 1957.

Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink.     The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol. In this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.     Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \\"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\\"     \\"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\\"     Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \\"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\\"     \\"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\\"     The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers.

Similarly, the name of Ang Lee is a draw that attracted a number of actors to his new film, \\"Taking Woodstock.\\" From left, \\"Taking Woodstock's\\" Emile Hirsch, director Ang Lee and Demetri Martin at the movie's premiere. \\"Taking Woodstock,\\" which is out August 28, features performers who were either not born or very young when the monumental festival occurred in 1969, but many were enticed to join the movie because of Lee's involvement. \\"I'd read the Sunday paper for Ang Lee. I'd do anything. He's a filmmaker I've always admired and [was] sort of eager to work with,\\" said Liev Schreiber, who plays a transvestite. \\"So when he approached me, you know: Dress, shmess, I'll do whatever you want.\\" The movie also tested Hirsch's and Schreiber personal boundaries: In addition to Schreiber's dress,","output":"Hirsch had to immerse himself in the free-spirited atmosphere of Woodstock and shed his inhibitions for some of the scenes. \\"Taking Woodstock\\" received mixed reviews from both critics and audiences, with many praising Ang Lee's direction and the performances from the ensemble cast, while others felt that the film didn't quite capture the true essence of what made the historic festival so iconic. However, its exploration of themes like personal identity, acceptance, and the power of music resonated with many viewers. As the film comes to an end, the characters experience a personal journey of self-discovery, finding solace and liberation within the chaos of the festival. Woodstock becomes a transformative experience for them, allowing them to break free from societal expectations and fully embrace the spirit of the 1960s counterculture. Ultimately, the film is a tribute to an iconic event in history, offering a snapshot of a generation that was finding its voice and identity, taking Woodstock as a symbol of that movement. Ang Lee, Emile Hirsch, and Demetri Martin continue their successful careers in the film industry, consistently drawing audiences and critical acclaim. Meanwhile, \\"Taking Woodstock\\" remains a memorable part of their filmographies, celebrating the power of music, self-expression, and human connection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead. They are discovered in each other's arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit's reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to straighten things out with Biddle. To prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and he means nothing to her.

We will keep open lines of communication.\\"  But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack.  A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.  Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.  The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

The five armed and masked attackers raped six Spanish women after forcing their way into a rented beach house and tying up their six male companions, CNN reports. Authorities say the attack does not appear to be drug cartel-related, though analysts say the line between common and organized crime in the resort city has become extremely blurred after years of drug war carnage, reports the CBC. Acapulco Mayor Luis Walton swiftly condemned the attack, admitting it would hurt the city's image, but later apologized for saying \\"it happens anywhere in the world,\\" Reuters reports. The mayor \\"very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts,\\" his office said in a statement. The victims, who range in age from 20 to 34, are now under the protection of Mexican authorities and are receiving consular assistance.","output":"Title: Acapulco Police Hunting for Gang Behind Brutal Attack on Spanish Tourists Acapulco, a once-popular tourist destination in Mexico, is now facing another wave of violence after a savage attack on a group of Spanish tourists. The local police are searching for a gang of five masked men who targeted a rented beach house and unleashed a terrifying, hours-long assault on the individuals inside. The Mexican coastal city saw a horrific incident this week, when the armed attackers burst into the beach house and held the six male tourists hostage. According to reports from CNN, the men were tied up, while their six female companions were subjected to an appalling series of assaults. Each of the women was raped by the intruders in an attack that lasted for several hours. Authorities have confirmed that the attack on the Spanish tourists does not appear to be linked to the ongoing drug cartel war in the region. However, the area is no stranger to violence, with clashes between rival criminal gangs responsible for numerous deaths in recent years. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has reported that the distinction between drug war-related incidents and local criminal activity has gradually blurred, making it more difficult to determine the motives behind such attacks. The Mayor of Acapulco, Luis Walton, was quick to publicly condemn the appalling assault on the Spanish tourists. However, his initial comments have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing him of displaying a lack of sensitivity towards the victims. Walton initially stated that such attacks \\"happen anywhere in the world,\\" a comment he later apologized for, claiming it had been misinterpreted. A statement from the mayor's office read: \\"The mayor very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts.\\" In addition to the pursuit of the attackers, the Mexican authorities have taken the six Spanish women into their protection and provided them with consular assistance. The victims, aged between 20 and 34, are now being given the support they need following the traumatic events. The attack on the Spanish tourists has further tarnished Acapulco's already damaged image as a popular vacation spot. The city was a famous Hollywood getaway during the 1950s and has long been a favorite for US Spring Breakers, but the upsurge of violence in recent years has proven costly for the local tourism industry. Walton's admission, in his statement, suggests that the authorities are well aware of the lasting impact this brutal attack will have on the area's image. Currently, Acapulco remains on edge as the manhunt for the five armed and masked assailants continues. Local efforts to restore the city's image as a safe and family-friendly destination will face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of incidents like this assault on innocent tourists. The Mexican police and government officials will need to demonstrate their commitment to tackling crime and ensuring the safety of their citizens and visitors alike if they are to redeem the reputation of this once-thriving coastal resort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eventually, after almost killing a vagrant the night before, his wife persuades him to go to church with her where he is eventually converted.Later, on a church/missionary trip to Uganda to build homes for refugees, he asks one of the SPLA soldiers watching over them to take him on a trip to the north, to Sudan.

They arrive at a medical tent in Sudan, as his friend moves off to talk came in to some people, Sam is roped in by a redheaded female doctor to help lift a lipless Sudanese woman onto the examination table. That night as they lay on their beds at the relief station, they hear noises outside, when they look out Sam and the soldier see large numbers of Sudanese children swarming in to sleep outside the building.The soldier explains that their parents send them to sleep over there because it is safer than staying in their own village.

Killer: Heather Butler who knocked Sam Brown, 15, off his bicycle and killed him in Eastrington, East Yorkshire. A drunk nurse mowed down a 15-year-old boy while driving to work and left him to die – but only after stopping to remove his damaged bicycle from the front of her car. Heather Butler, 67, was unsteady and slurring her words when she arrived for her shift at a nursing home and a breath-test showed she was two-and-a-half times the legal limit, a court heard. She was jailed for five years and four months at Hull Crown Court. Judge Mark Bury told her it ‘would have been obvious’ she had hit the boy and the tragedy was made worse because she was ‘going to work caring for people and possibly giving out medication’ while drunk. By coincidence Butler knew the victim’s mother because she worked at the same nursing home. Her Audi A4 car ploughed into schoolboy Sam Brown as he and a friend cycled home in the dark at 9pm without rear lights. Her windscreen was smashed and wing mirror removed. She stopped 200 metres on to remove the bike from her grille, threw it aside and continued to work less than a mile away without going back to treat Sam or his 15-year-old friend, who suffered a broken shoulder. Butler had drunk a glass of wine and ‘three home measures’ of gin and tonic before driving, the court heard. When she arrived at the Old School House Nursing Home in Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, she was asked if she was alright and replied: ‘No, I think I hit a cyclist.’ Two colleagues went out in a car, found Sam and tried to help  motorists resuscitate him. He died of head injuries in hospital. The court heard Butler had been reported for being drunk at work in the past and ‘it was rare she did not smell of alcohol’. Motorist Nicholas Webb was behind Butler at the time of the crash on the B1230 on September 6 last year. He said she was ‘all over the road’ and ‘driving fast’, prompting him to drop back. She was speeding and a crash investigation found she did not brake or take evasive action. In a statement to police, Butler recalled ‘seeing a cyclist ahead of me, very close to me, and then I felt the impact at the front of my car.’ Victim: Sam Brown, 15, was thrown off his bicycle after being clipped by Butler's Audi A4 as he cycled with his friend. Victim: Sam Brown who died after being hit by Heather Butler's Audi A4 in Eastrington, East Yorkshire. She added: ‘Following the feeling I. pulled over and got out. I could not see anything close to my car. I was. in a state of panic and thought I should drive to work and report it. at work. 'Sometimes I wish I was not here. The loss is something I will feel for the rest of my life' Tracey Brown, mother of Sam Brown. ‘It never occurred to me to use my mobile phone.’ Butler, who is married and worked at. the nursing home for 18 years, admitted causing death by careless. driving while over the limit, failing to report an accident and failing. to stop. Paul Genney, defending, said she wanted to apologise. He said: ‘She is genuinely remorseful.’ Butler has resigned and is likely to. be struck off the nursing register. Butler was given a five-year. driving ban and ordered to take an extended re-test. She is likely to. serve only half of her prison term. Crash scene: Flowers are piled up in tribute to Sam Brown, 15, following the accident on the the B1230 Hull Road last September. In a statement mother-of-four Tracey Brown, 42, said losing Sam was ‘unbearable’. 'Following the feeling I pulled over and got out. I could not see anything close to my car. I was in a state of panic and thought I should drive to work and report it at work' Heather Butler. She added: ‘Sometimes I wish I was not here. The loss is something I will feel for the rest of my life.’ After the hearing she and husband Stephen, 45, described the sentence as ‘disgusting’. Franki Hackett of road safety charity Brake said: ‘It is appalling such a callous crime could lead to such a paltry sentence. ‘It makes a mockery of justice that someone could face less than three years in prison for taking a promising young life.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

However, the bureau has been struggling to fill the void left by one of their strongest assets - Liz Sherman, the firestarter. Liz, a former BPRD agent with the ability to create and control fire, left the bureau five years ago after a tragic mission, causing her to lose control which resulted in the death of innocents. Since then, she has been living off the grid, battling her guilt and afraid of her own destructive powers. John Myers, an experienced BPRD agent who had once shared a close bond with Liz, is determined to bring her back to the fold. With major paranormal threats looming on the horizon that could shatter the balance between humans and the supernatural, Liz's powers may be the only thing that can save humanity. Myers tracks Liz to a remote mountain where Liz is seeking to control her fiery abilities under the tutelage of an ancient fire elementalist named Moranna. Meanwhile, back at the BPRD, a sinister supernatural cult led by the charismatic and ruthless Magnus DeMarce has infiltrated the organization and seeks to unleash its master's diabolical agenda. As Magnus and his cult advance their insidious plan to awaken and control a primordial force of darkness, the BPRD finds itself scrambling to counter their every move, losing more and more ground. Myers, finally convincing Liz of the danger to the world and stressing the importance of her return, manages to coax her back to the BPRD.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Lester Willis Young (August 27, 1909 - March 15, 1959), nicknamed \\"Pres\\" or \\"Prez\\", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and occasional clarinetist. Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \\"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music. Young left the Basie band in late 1940. He is rumored to have refused to play with the band on Friday, December 13 of that year for superstitious reasons spurring his dismissal, although Young and drummer Jo Jones would later state that his departure had been in the works for months. He subsequently led a number of small groups that often included his brother, drummer Lee Young, for the next couple of years; live and broadcast recordings from this period exist.  During this period Young accompanied the singer Billie Holiday in a couple of studio sessions (during 1937 - 1941 period) and also made a small set of recordings with Nat \\"King\\" Cole (their first of several collaborations) in June 1942. His studio recordings are relatively sparse during the 1942 to 1943 period, largely due to the recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians. Small record labels not bound by union contracts continued to record and he recorded some sessions for Harry Lim's Keynote label in 1943.  In December 1943 Young returned to the Basie fold for a 10-month stint, cut short by his being drafted into the army during World War II (see below). Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players). While he never abandoned the cane reed, he used the plastic reed a significant share of the time from 1943 until the end of his life. Another cause for the thickening of his tone around this time was a change in saxophone mouthpiece from a metal Otto Link to an ebonite Brilhart. In August 1944 Young appeared alongside drummer Jo Jones, trumpeter Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, and fellow tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Gjon Mili's short film Jammin' the Blues. Why did he change to a plastic reed?","output":"Lester Young started to make much greater use of a plastic reed during the 1943 period, which gave his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone, although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players.

The setting then changes to the present day, where Deloris (now going by the surname Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in a 1960s-themed act called The Ronelles (a parody of The Ronettes), who sing at The Moonlite Lounge of the Nevada Club in Reno, Nevada, run by her boyfriend, the mobster Vince LaRocca. After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes. Deloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it.

Bowe Bergdahl has been held by the Taliban since 2009 America’s only prisoner-of-war may finally be coming home. Four years after Private Bowe Bergdahl was seized from a dusty no-man’s-land in Afghanistan, his parents are this weekend negotiating directly with the Taliban for his release. But for Bob and Jani Bergdahl, whose exhausting campaign for their son’s return is reflected in the now tattered yellow ribbons that are tied around their ranch in Hailey, Idaho, the most difficult battle may still be ahead. Rumours that he has gone rogue were prompted by Bowe’s criticism of the","output":"US military and its operations in Afghanistan in emails sent to his parents prior to his capture. Some of his fellow soldiers have accused him of desertion, claiming he willingly left his post before being captured by the Taliban. As the only U.S. prisoner-of-war, Bowe Bergdahl's case has gained significant attention throughout his captivity. In 2014, further hopes for his release were raised when the Obama administration negotiated the exchange of five top-ranking Taliban fighters held at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl's freedom. The negotiation process has been complex and fraught with many challenges. Both the U.S. government and the Bergdahl family have been working tirelessly to secure his safe return. The family's direct negotiations with the Taliban demonstrate their determination to ensure the release of their son. Despite the challenging and long-awaited negotiation process, the article implies that Bowe Bergdahl's eventual return home could be accompanied by a more difficult battle. This is primarily due to the rumors and accusations surrounding his actions before his capture. The rumors of Bowe going rogue have introduced another layer of complexity into his case. His criticisms of the U.S. military's presence and actions in Afghanistan - expressed in emails to his parents - have led some to question his loyalty to his country. Most significantly, several of his fellow soldiers have accused him of desertion, stating that he willingly left his post before being taken captive by the Taliban. These accusations of desertion have further politicized his case, with some accusing the Obama administration of trading high-ranking Taliban prisoners for someone they perceive as a traitor. The potential fallout from these rumors and accusations might very well intensify Bowe Bergdahl's post-release struggles. The heart-wrenching campaign of his parents to secure his release, symbolized by the weathered yellow ribbons tied around their ranch, highlights not only their unwavering support and determination but also the difficulties that may lie ahead for Bowe and his family once he is finally home. Upon his return, Bowe Bergdahl may face military investigation and potential repercussions for alleged desertion. At the same time, he will also have to reunite with his family and reintegrate into society after many years in captivity. The community's reception to his eventual homecoming might be mixed, with some showing support and empathy, while others continue to harbor suspicions and resentment based on the lingering rumors of desertion. In conclusion, while the imminent release of Bowe Bergdahl holds the promise of his long-awaited homecoming, the struggle for the Bergdahl family and for Bowe himself might be far from over. The rumors and accusations surrounding his capture have created significant challenges that he and his family will need to overcome upon his return. Navigating the complexities of public opinion and the potential implications of a military investigation are likely to present considerable difficulties in the coming months and years, even after Bowe is finally reunited with his loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When her mentor-like guardian, Holger Palmgren, suddenly takes ill, she is appointed a new guardian.  A conniving lawyer, Nils Bjurman, is assigned as her new ward. He uses his power over her finances and autonomy to control her. Things quickly get tense as Bjurman, far from being the benign supporters of Salander, turns predator.

Question: Given the following context:  When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who did the men who deserted tell of La Salle's death in 1688?  Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel,  made their way to Illinois Country.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits.

They also both clarify that it was introduced for the first time in 2011.     - Sentence 1: \\"For the 2007 games, Futsal was added to the Basque programme (and from 2011 for the first time)\\"     - Sentence 2: \\"For the 2007 Games, Futsal was added to the program for the Basque (and as of 2011 first time)\\" 2.

The differences between the two sentences include slight variations in the structure and some word choices.     - Sentence 1 uses \\"Basque programme,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"program for the Basque.\\"     - In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"and from 2011 for the first time\\" is enclosed in parentheses, while Sentence 2 uses \\"and as of 2011 first time\\" without parentheses. This makes the information in Sentence 1 appear as a side note or an additional detail, while Sentence 2 integrates it more directly into the main point.     - Capitalization is inconsistent between the two sentences, with Sentence 1 capitalizing \\"Games\\" but not \\"racquetball\\" and \\"pelota,\\" and Sentence 2 capitalizing \\"Futsal\\", \\"Games,\\" \\"Basque,\\" \\"Racquetball\\", and \\"Pelota.\\" Since \\"Basque,\\" \\"Futsal,\\" \\"Racquetball,\\" and \\"Pelota\\" are proper nouns, they should ideally be capitalized, while \\"games\\" should not. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same meaning, albeit with minor differences in structure and word choice. The primary focus remains on the changes in the Basque sports program between the 2007 and 2011 Games, specifically the addition of Futsal and the removal of Racquetball and Pelota."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fire officials comb the scene at the 3200 block of Woodland Drive NW, where four people were found dead at a house fire. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)      When Debra Masser spoke to her brother Savvas Savopoulos by phone Thursday morning, the chief executive and father of a prominent local family seemed to be untroubled and in good spirits.      But hours later, Savopoulos, his wife and two others authorities believe are the couple’s young son and their housekeeper were found dead by firefighters who battled a blaze at their Northwest Washington home.      Police on Friday continued to try to piece together what happened to the well-liked family, even as the mystery around the case deepened. D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said that the fire at the stately home on Woodland Drive NW was intentionally set, that three of the victims inside had wounds, and that the family’s Porsche 911 was found torched in a church parking lot in Hyattsville, Md.      The deaths shocked family, friends and neighbors, who said they had seen nothing amiss with the five-member clan in the days and weeks before the fire. Some gathered to mourn at Washington National Cathedral, while investigators continued to pore over the charred red brick home.      “I can’t even express my sorrow,” Masser said. “I can’t even say anything.”      Savvas Savopoulos and Amy Savopoulos at the Starlight Children’s Foundation MidAtlantic’s Wine Dinner in 2008. (Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine)      Lanier said police had positively identified two of the dead as Savvas Savopoulos, 46, and his wife, Amy, 47. They have tentatively identified the other victims as the couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, and a 57-year-old housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, of Silver Spring, Md.      Lanier said that three victims suffered blunt-force or sharp-object wounds and that all four deaths in the upscale neighborhood near the vice president’s residence were being investigated as homicides.      “Evidence collection will go on for several days,” Lanier said. “There’s still a lot more we don’t know.”      Lanier renewed a call she originally made Thursday for information about the family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911, which disappeared from the home Thursday morning.      She asked the public to contact authorities if anyone had seen it between Wednesday and Thursday at 5 p.m. — a longer time frame than authorities had initially requested. Lanier declined to explain why investigators now wanted to know about the car’s whereabouts a day earlier.      The Porsche was found burning in Prince George’s County on Thursday evening, Lanier said. Prince George’s County Fire spokesman Mark Brady said firefighters extinguished the fire about 5:30 p.m. behind a church at 8201 Annapolis Rd. in Lanham, Md. Lanier said it was unclear who had been driving the vehicle.      Lanier said there was no evidence to suggest random or forced entry into the Savopouloses’ home but asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious in the area to call police. Asked whether the house had been ransacked, Lanier said it was “difficult to make that determination” because of the fire. Authorities have been going through the home to try to determine whether anything was stolen, according to two officials with knowledge of the case.      Police say three of the four victims found in a burning Northwest D.C. home on Thursday suffered blunt force or sharp object wounds. Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. (WUSA9)      The Savopouloses are survived by two teenage daughters, who friends said were at their boarding schools Thursday. Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate next week. Her younger sister, Katerina, is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J.      Philip was a student at St. Albans School in the District.      Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for more than a decade. They described the community as tightknit and said the Savopouloses were an integral part of it. They regularly held gatherings at their home for neighbors and friends. They attended church at the nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral for about 10 years.      Coco Palomeque, a friend who lives in the neighborhood, said the Savopouloses were “a beautiful family.”      “The community where they lived really loved them,” she said.      Savvas Savopoulos was the president and chief executive of Hyattsville-based American Iron Works, which played a role in building Verizon Center and ­CityCenterDC. His Facebook page says he also worked for Sigma Investment Strategies in Puerto Rico. American Iron Works officials declined to comment.      Amy Savopoulos was widely known as a deeply involved mother who spent much of her time volunteering at her children’s schools or raising funds for them.      On her Facebook page, her daughter Abigail posted a tribute on Mother’s Day: “I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you for always believing in me and supporting me. Thank you for the early morning crafts, upside down clowns on my birthday, gingerbread decorating parties, and for always showing up. . . . Thank you for the past 19 years and I look forward to the many more to come. I love you so much.”      About 180 people gathered to mourn the family Friday afternoon in a lower-level chapel at Washington National Cathedral. The 30-minute service included prayer, singing and periods of silence.      Many who had come were struggling not only with what happened, but also with how to discuss it with their children, said the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who helped lead the service.      “When people grieve, they want to be with other people,” Budde said. “Everyone is really sad, and really shocked.”      Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has known the family for more than 20 years, said in a statement that he was saddened. Savvas Savopoulos raised money for Van Hollen’s campaigns.      “My heart goes out to the Savopoulos family at this time of unspeakable tragedy,” the statement read. “They were an important part of the community and will be deeply missed.”      As friends and relatives grieved, investigators wearing yellow hard hats walked in and out of the gutted Savopoulos home. Yellow police tape still blocked off sections of Woodland Drive and 32nd Street NW, and a large ATF explosives and fire investigation vehicle was parked out front.      Joe Carregal, a neighbor, said he saw the fire unfold Thursday. About 1:15 p.m., he said he saw smoke pouring from the upper-story windows of the home and a man knocking on the front door in an attempt to get the family out.      Soon after, fire trucks came roaring down the street. Firefighters broke windows on the house, deployed ladders and clambered onto the roof to extinguish flames. Carregal said he watched them pull three victims from the house.      Chris Vorobek, who lives in the neighborhood, said he would see Amy Savopoulos, walking her dog in the neighborhood, and her son racing around on his bicycle.      “He was a great kid,” Vorobek said.      Keith L. Alexander, Lynh Bui, Alice Crites, Abigail Hauslohner, Peter Hermann, Roxanne Roberts, Valerie Strauss, Julie Tate and Clarence Williams contributed to this report. |||||","output":"In Washington D.C., police have released a video of a person of interest in relation to a suspicious fire at the home of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos.

It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.  I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer and Maria both had unprotected sex with the same man. This man, unbeknownst to them, has hepatitis b. Both women go to the doctor to get checked out. Jennifer reports that she is coughing frequently and has a congested nose. The doctor notices that Maria has yellow eyes and she tells the doctor that she has been throwing up.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will probably not be prescribed medicine for their liver? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation presented, it is more likely that Jennifer will not be prescribed medicine for her liver. This is because the symptoms she has reported, such as coughing frequently and having a congested nose, are not associated with Hepatitis B infection. These symptoms may point to an unrelated respiratory or common cold infection. On the other hand, Maria is showing symptoms that are consistent with Hepatitis B infection, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. Yellowing of the eyes is a sign of jaundice, which is caused by liver damage or dysfunction as a result of the Hepatitis B virus. Vomiting is another symptom mentioned in the background article specific to Hepatitis B. It is important to note that both Jennifer and Maria should still be tested for Hepatitis B, given their exposure to a partner with the virus through unprotected sex. Additionally, a healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the appropriate course of action and treatment for each individual, as this answer cannot replace the personalized guidance of a medical professional. However, based on the information provided, it is more probable that Jennifer will not be prescribed medicine for her liver due to her symptoms being unrelated to Hepatitis B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bread has to be kept outdoors happens, how will it affect the bread is kept somewhere more dry.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process. If the bread has to be kept outdoors but is stored in a drier location, it can impact the process in the following ways: 1. Direct effect: A drier location will reduce the bread's ability to absorb moisture from the air. This means that the bread will likely remain less moist, making it less conducive for mold growth. 2. Indirect effect: Since the bread is outdoors, it will still be exposed to the elements like dust particles with mold spores. However, in a drier location, the reduced moisture content in the bread might slow down the mold spores' ability to consume the bread for energy, thus delaying or limiting the growth of mold colonies. In summary, keeping the bread in a drier location outdoors will likely have a direct impact on the bread's moisture absorption and an indirect impact on the mold growth process. This results in a slower or less extensive mold development compared to bread kept in a more humid environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the birds laying eggs. The life cycle you described consists of the following stages: 1. The birds lay eggs: This marks the beginning of a new generation, where adult birds most commonly create a safe and secure nest for their eggs. They then lay their eggs in this nest, where the development of the embryos inside the eggs commences. 2. The egg hatches into a baby bird: After a certain incubation period specific to the species, the baby bird (also known as a hatchling or chick) emerges from the egg. This process typically involves the chick breaking the eggshell using a small protrusion on its upper beak called an egg tooth. 3. Baby bird eats and grows: The baby bird needs nutrition to grow and develop. It usually relies on its parents to feed it until it can find food on its own. During this period, the hatchling undergoes rapid growth and will begin to develop its adult features. 4. Grows into an adult bird: As the bird matures, it acquires the physical characteristics required for survival, such as feathers, proper proportions, and strength. At this stage, the bird is considered an adult and can now fend for itself, including finding food, avoiding predators, and developing social skills. 5. The bird finds a mate: As part of the reproductive process, adult birds of most species seek to find a suitable mate. This often involves courtship rituals and displays intended to attract a partner for breeding. 6. The pair build a nest: Once a suitable mate has been found, the pair of birds work together to construct a nest. This serves as a safe place for them to lay their eggs and raise their offspring. 7. Return to step 1: After laying eggs, the life cycle is now complete and starts anew with the next generation."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: How does Hercules finally kill the hydra? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Hercules Context: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown).

The island of Saint Helena has a total area of 122 km2 (47 sq mi), and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago). Coastal areas are covered in volcanic rock and warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak at 818 m (2,684 ft). In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced, and native species have been adversely affected as a result.

It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight. Question: What's the tone of the whole passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Objective\\"?

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) is ordered to investigate a basement level station which they believed was attacked. After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.Recovering from his earlier bee attack, the stung son and some friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, who head to Marysville.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why does some feel claustrophobic ?","output":"Based on the available evidence from the passage, one might feel claustrophobic due to a few factors. Firstly, the concert attendees had to carry their bags into the actual theater because they did not have enough cash for the bag check. Carrying bags and additional belongings into a crowded concert venue can lead to a sense of claustrophobia because large or even small bags can make it harder to navigate through the space, and attendees might worry about the bags taking up space or being a nuisance to others around them. Secondly, the only available seats for the group were in the back, which led them to \\"bunch up\\" around the stage. The term \\"bunch up\\" suggests that they were standing together closely in order to get a better view of the stage, possibly due to the stage being at a distance from their actual seats. This act of everyone standing close together in a tight space could create a feeling of claustrophobia, as it suggests that there was limited room to move or breathe comfortably. Lastly, it is essential to consider the general environment of a concert, which can be inherently claustrophobic for some individuals. Concerts typically involve large crowds, loud music, and limited personal space, which can all contribute to feelings of claustrophobia. In summary, the passage implies that one could feel claustrophobic due to having to carry their bags into the theater, \\"bunching up\\" around the stage, and the overall crowded nature of the concert environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:The men - a Russian, a Latvian and an Estonian, as well as three others described as stateless - were given sentences ranging from 7 to 12 years. The freighter left Finland in July 2009 and disappeared after passing through the English Channel. The Russian navy said it was eventually found off the Cape Verde islands. The Maltese-flagged ship's purported destination had been thousands of miles away in Algeria. It was supposedly carrying timber but its disappearance had led to speculation that it was smuggling illicit weapons, possibly Russian missiles destined for Syria or Iran. By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow All the trials of the Arctic Sea hijackers are now over. But we are no closer to knowing what actually happened. The official Russian position - and the one presented by prosecutors at the trials - was that the ship was boarded by pirates demanding a ransom, shortly after leaving Finland with a cargo of timber for Algeria. There have been persistent suggestions, however, that the ship was actually carrying weapons, possibly S-300 missile defence systems destined for Iran, possibly weapons for Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is something Russia strongly denies. For many commentators, there is something about the official version of the story that just does not add up. Why were the Russian government so cagey about the incident at the time? Why did the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disappear for a day in September, apparently on a secret visit to Moscow? And why did the pirates choose this particular ship to hijack? There were reports that Israel had warned Moscow that it was aware the ship was carrying S-300 surface-to-air missiles. Three other men have already been imprisoned in connection with the hijacking and Russian authorities say everyone involved has now been convicted. While the court in Archangelsk gave jail terms to all six of the men for piracy and kidnapping, one of the accused, Yevgeny Mironov, was sentenced to 7 years' hard labour. Russian media reported that his lawyer was planning an appeal. According to Russian investigators, the men had made their plans to attack cargo ships from the Estonian capital, Tallinn. Crew members reported the Arctic Sea had been boarded on 24 July, close to two Swedish islands, by men wearing police uniforms. Although radio contact with the ship was lost after it sailed between Britain and France, it is understood that several countries continued to track its progress as it headed towards Cape Verde, off the West African coast.

Secondly, the user highlights that it is very easy for a child to pull the entire tab out of the book, exposing the staples used to connect the acetate to the cardboard tab.

A card with a large black ace (of spades) is put on his chest. Another \\"Black Ace\\" victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life.     Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey.  Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel.   It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.    Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness;  when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents and Uncle Jack – firmly in Quincey's life.   Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.  In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.  Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes.  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.  Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.  The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997).  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it? Answer:","output":"The specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it is known as \\"woodblock printing.\\" This technique was considered old-fashioned by the Japanese art establishment, but artists in the sōsaku-hanga movement, such as Kanae Yamamoto, began to embrace it, marking a shift in attitude towards this traditional method. Woodblock printing eventually gained recognition within the art community as a valid form of expression and an essential part of the development of modern Japanese printmaking."},{"instruction":"Q: This task is to identify the language of a sentence correctly by classifying if it is English or Telugu అన్ని బయటకు వెళ్ళి.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: In order to pinpoint where a bra does or does not fit well, be aware of the various part of a bra.  The cup: The part where your breasts fit into. It’s usually made of stretchy fabric, and can have up to 3 tailored seams. The band: This is the elastic part that goes all the way around your chest. The wings: These are the portions of the band that extend from the end of the cups to the center of the back. The straps: These go over the shoulders and are often adjustable, and sometimes padded. The closure: This is usually a hook and eye set at the center back. However, it can also be in front, or absent. The center gore: This is the part between the cups in the front. If you appear to have 4, you have what is called the “quad boob effect.” This indicates that the cups are too small, and there's not enough room inside. This is especially apparent if you try your shirt on over your bra. If it does, this means that the band is too loose.  Try raising your arms and bending backward a bit to check if this happens. Remember, when you go up a band size, go down a cup size. If it won’t, then the bra doesn't fit.  This could be because the underwire is the wrong shape for your breasts. It could also indicate that the cup size is either too large or too small. You should be able to run your fingers around under the edge of the fabric.  If you can pull it away from your back by more than 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm), it's too loose. If the band digs into your sides to the extent that it causes pain after wearing it, the band is too small. If the band rides up, try loosening the straps. If this doesn’t work, the band is too big. This does not necessarily mean the band is too tight.  Instead, look for bras that have a wider band or a “leotard band” to create a smoother silhouette. Unless the band is causing you pain, don’t go up a band size, otherwise you will not have enough support. This could also indicate that the cup size is too small.  Another solution is to wear a body shaping undergarment. This could mean that the cup size is too big, the style is wrong, or that you have not put the bra on properly.  Try adjusting your breasts to make sure they are centered in the cup. This could also mean that the bra is not right for your breast shape. If your breasts are fuller at the bottom than at the top, you may need a differently shaped bra, such as a “demi cup” or “balcony” style bra. This can cause pain, and other problems.   Straps that dig into your shoulders can cause long term problems, such as headaches, back pain, permanent indentations, and even nerve damage. Try looking for bras with wide, padded straps, especially if you have larger breasts. Shoulder pain could also indicate that the band is too big and not providing enough support. The support should come from the band, not the straps. If you’ve adjusted the straps and they still keep falling, try a different bra.  Petite women and women with sloping shoulders often have this problem. Make sure the straps are set close enough together and are fully adjustable. Underwires that are fitted properly should not cause any pain or discomfort.  If the cup is too small, the underwire may not fit comfortably under your breasts. Also, your individual breasts may not necessarily be the same shape as the manufacturer’s underwires. You may have trouble wearing underwires if you have a higher rib cage. Underwires are not recommended for pregnant women or women undergoing surgery. Some medical conditions may also make it inadvisable to wear underwires. Bras without underwire can be just as supportive, even if you have larger breasts, as long as the fit is correct. Summary:","output":"Understanding the different parts of a bra is essential to determine if it fits well or not. These parts include the cup, band, wings, straps, closure, and center gore. Issues such as the \\"quad boob effect,\\" looseness or tightness of the band or straps, and cup size discrepancies can all indicate improper fit. The shape and style of the bra, as well as individual breast shapes, should be considered when trying to find the best fit. Furthermore, be aware of potential health issues like shoulder pain and nerve damage caused by ill-fitting bras. Petite women, those with sloping shoulders, and those with unique breast shapes may require special considerations when choosing a bra. Underwires may cause discomfort for some individuals, but proper fit and alternative bras without underwires can still provide support. Understand the importance of a well-fitting bra for both comfort and long-term health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - Lad tiden gå ( English : Let time pass ) is a 1986 science fiction novel by Danish modernist writer Svend Aage Madsen . The novel focuses on one of the central themes in Madsen 's writing - the nature of time . Like most of Madsen 's novels it has n't been published in English . This novel is a typical example of the third phase in Madsen 's writing that 's like most of his later works is set in the town of Aarhus and has several characters that also appear in his other books ( Johanna , Sverre ) . It also has another typical feature of Madsen 's books - a complicated timeline of the novel having chapters describing overlapping periods of time .  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - Svend Åge Madsen (born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction. His novels are generally philosophical and humorous. Several of his works have been made into films in Denmark. His writings are extensive and has been translated into many languages.

Context: The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui).

A small coastal village in North Scotland, in 1970s.The village neighborhood didnt like foreigners, especially when those people worshiped different religions. The public of this village were very pious. In un-developed regions, women arent allowed to participate in the funeral ceremonies. The film was the first film of a trilogy, the names of which Golden Heart series. The movie was recorded by a hand-held camera, that brings audiences into the place. This technique made the fiction more realistic. The main character was Bess who had some mental problems and a childish manner. She had to be taken care of by her family members. She was talking with herself with a God Voice and tried to find a way to endure her pain. In the early chapters, we saw, Bess and Jan got married, had an incredible honeymoon and sexual experience. When Jan started to work, she missed him very much and begged God for the return her husband immediately. Everything changed with an accident. When Jan was in the oil-rig, he injured his neck and completely paralyzed. When Bess learned the accident, first she was very happy but then she started to blame herself. Their sex relations remained to fall down that situation. Jan asked her to take a lover and tell him the details. Because Jan knew Besss church wouldnt permit divorce. What do we think about Jans suggestion? Did he really want to get rid of her, for her sake? Or did he just think about himself? I think the story didnt answer this question. We should think about a man who was completely paralyzed and became selfish. Dodo, who was Besss sister-in-law, said sickness is a mighty power They quarreled about Besss situation. Jan believed Bess has more strength than them. Because of the whole painful process, Jan attempted to kill himself. When he failed, he asked Dodo for help for his own suicide.

Article: The unborn daughter of Tony Award-winning actress Ruthie Ann Miles died due to injuries suffered in a horrific Brooklyn crash that also killed two other kids, the mom’s lawyer said Wednesday.      The actress was about 30 weeks pregnant when she was among those hit by a car driven by Staten Island motorist Dorothy Bruns, who plowed through a Park Slope crosswalk March 5.      Miles’ 4-year-old daughter, Abigail Blumenstein, and another child — 20-month-old Joshua Lew — were killed that day.      This past Friday, Miles’ unborn baby, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein, became yet another victim when she died from injuries, said the family’s lawyer, Ben Rubinowitz.      “As many of you know, Ruthie and Jonathan’s daughter, Abigail, was tragically killed. At the time of the crash Ruthie was pregnant and was severely injured,” Rubinowitz said in a statement.      “This past Friday Ruthie and Jonathan lost their baby, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein,” Rubinowitz said. “The pain suffered by Ruthie and Jonathan is nearly impossible to fathom.      “As you might imagine, they are overwhelmed by the sadness of the deaths of their children. Ruthie and Jonathan are grateful for the support of their family and friends but wish and ask that their privacy be respected during this most trying time. Ruthie and Jonathan continue to seek God’s presence, mercy and peace.”      Miles won a Tony in 2015 for her work in “The King and I.”      Bruns has been charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, assault, and reckless driving.      She faces up to 15 years behind bars if convicted on all charges. ||||| NEW YORK -- A woman who had a seizure behind the wheel of her car which then rolled into a Brooklyn crosswalk, killing the 4-year-old daughter of a Tony Award-winning actress and a 1-year-old boy, was arrested on manslaughter charges Thursday for deaths that prosecutors said should never have happened.      Just two months before the March crash, prosecutors said, a medical episode caused the woman, 44-year-old Dorothy Bruns, to drive into a parked car. She then had a seizure while hospitalized and was told by a doctor not to drive for one year -- advice that was repeated during two follow-up appointments.      Despite those instructions, Bruns was involved in a fender bender on Jan. 20 and left the scene, according to prosecutors.      And then, on March 5, Bruns suffered another seizure while stopped at a red light in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Her car rolled into the crosswalk, striking actress Ruthie Ann Blumenstein and her 4-year-old daughter, Abigail, and Lauren Lew and her 1-year-old son, Joshua. Both children were killed.      \\"She didn't listen, for whatever selfish reasons, and she continued to drive,\\" prosecutor Craig Esswein said Thursday in court. \\"And unfortunately, two families lost children because of the defendant's selfishness.\\"      A defense attorney, however, disputed that, according to CBS New York.      \\"The defendant was given a letter by that neurologist clearing her for her regular activities,\\" defense attorney David Jacobs said in court Thursday.      Horrifying video footage captured at the scene of the deadly crash shows the white car moving into the crosswalk as the unsuspecting pedestrians are mowed down.      Bruns was arrested Thursday at her Staten Island home. She pleaded not guilty in a Brooklyn court to charges that included manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and reckless driving.      A call to Bruns' attorney wasn't immediately returned. She was ordered held on 75,000 bond and faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the top charge.      \\"Her alleged insistence on driving despite doctor's orders and serious medical conditions that prevented her from safely doing so was not only irresponsible, it was unlawful,\\" said District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said.      First-responders to the Brooklyn crash said she was foaming at the mouth, confused and unsteady on her feet, and then suffered another seizure in the ambulance on her way to the hospital and again at the hospital, prosecutors said.      Getty      Blumenstein, who is pregnant, was hospitalized in intensive care but later said in a statement that she was healing.      \\"By all accounts it is a miracle our second child is unharmed,\\" the statement read. \\"Please continue to pray for the Lew and Blumenstein families as we process the unthinkable.\\"      Blumenstein, who goes by the stage name Ruthie Ann Miles, won a featured actress Tony in 2015 for her role as Lady Thiang in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The King and I.\\" It marked her Broadway debut. Blumenstein's other credits included \\"Sunday in the Park with George\\" opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and playing Imelda Marcos in David Byrne's off-Broadway musical \\"Here Lies Love.\\" She had a recurring role on the FX series \\"The Americans.\\"      The crash prompted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to propose changes to state laws that would extend and expand speed enforcement cameras around school zones, escalate fines for repeat offenders up to 350, and strip vehicle registration for dangerous drivers. Such drivers could be people with serious medical conditions. ||||| Broadway star Ruthie Ann Miles is grieving the devastating loss of her unborn child, just two months after the death of her 4-year-old daughter Abigail in a tragic car crash.      “Ruthie is simply not doing well. The only consolation she had in Abigail’s death was the fact that her unborn baby had survived. But now losing that baby? She’s crushed to her core,” a friend close to Miles tells PEOPLE.      Get push notifications with news, features, and more.      “She loved being a mom. She couldn’t wait to expand her family. Losing those kids, it’s destroyed her. How can she even survive this? It’s taking every bit of her faith to find a way through,” the friend says.      Miles’ family lawyer, Ben Rubinowitz, announced on Wednesday that Ruthie and husband Jonathan Blumenstein’s unborn child, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein, died on May 11. Their baby girl, whom Ruthie was seven months pregnant with at the time of the crash, was due this month.      Ruthie Ann Miles and daughter Abigail in February 2017 Walter McBride/WireImage      “Ruthie and Jonathan started telling their close friends last week about the loss. They wanted them to hear about it first but kept the circle small as they’re not yet comfortable talking about it and still want privacy. To say that Ruthie is devastated would be an understatement,” the friend shares.      Miles, who won a Tony Award for best featured actress in a musical for her role in the 2015 revival of The King and I, was one of three non-fatal victims of the New York City collision that occurred in March.

Police confirmed that Abigail, who was pronounced dead upon arrival at Methodist Hospital, was one of two children hit and killed by a vehicle that was allegedly running a red light.      Ruthie Ann Miles Janette Pellegrini/FilmMagic      “Everyone in her life is rallying around Ruthie, as we have since the accident, but both she and Jonathan are really holding one another up through this. They’re deep in the grieving process,” another friend of Miles tells PEOPLE.      “They have a very strong bond, and that’s the one thing that hasn’t broken at all. If anyone will forge this path, it’s them. It’s just so sad, though. She’s going through unspeakable pain. You talk to her and you can just hear it in her voice — a part of her soul is gone.”      Prior to Abigail’s death, a source previously told PEOPLE that she “was excited to be a big sister.”      “She was the brightest little spirit,” said the source. “Every time you were around her, your heart couldn’t help but shine. She had the sweetest laugh and the loveliest personality. She was very much like her mother.”      Ruthie Ann Miles Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty      Earlier this month, a Brooklyn grand jury indicted Dorothy Bruns, the 44-year-old Staten Island driver involved in the fatal crash.      A prosecution source previously told PEOPLE that Bruns was arraigned on charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault stemming from the crash. Bruns’ lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf.      Police sources also told PEOPLE in March that Bruns allegedly told investigators she experienced a seizure at the time of the crash. Detectives are attempting to confirm this claim with medical officials, a source said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Ruthie Ann Miles, a Tony Award-winning actress, faced an unthinkable tragedy when her unborn daughter, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein, passed away due to injuries sustained in a car crash in Brooklyn on March 5.

Answer the following question: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos.  Which person studied less about volcanoes in an island arc? Answer:","output":"Gill studied mantles and volcanoes, while Pete focused on earthquakes. Although earthquakes can be related to volcanic activity, it is Gill who would have a more in-depth understanding of volcanoes, including those in an island arc, since her studies specifically focused on mantles and volcanoes.

Process:  - Prophase, the chromosomes become visible - Centrioles separate to move to opposite poles - Metaphase, the chromosomes line up in the center - Anaphase, the chromatids separate - Are pulled apart - Telophase, the chromosomes gather at opposite poles - Two new nuclear membranes form - The cell membranes pinch - Divide into two individual cells -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Mitosis does not occur happens, how will it affect HELPING mitosis to proceed normally.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If mitosis does not occur, it would significantly impact the normal functioning and development of an organism, as mitosis is a critical process for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction of cells. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a disturbance in the process of mitosis could lead to anomalies and potential harm to the organism. Considering this hypothesis, if mitosis does not occur, it would directly affect the process as follows: 1. Prophase: Chromosomes would not become visible, and centrioles would not separate to move to opposite poles. 2. Metaphase: Chromosomes would not line up in the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase: Chromatids would not separate or be pulled apart. 4. Telophase: Chromosomes would not gather at opposite poles, and new nuclear membranes would not form. 5. Cytokinesis: The cell membrane would not pinch or divide into two individual cells. These direct effects would lead to several indirect consequences, some of which are: 1. Impaired growth and development of the organism, as new cells are not being produced. 2. Inability to repair damaged tissues. 3. Dysfunctional asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms, leading to reduced population growth and compromised survival. 4.

Write an article based on this summary: – A British teenager struggling with an essay on an Ian McEwan book didn't get a top grade even after getting help from his father—Ian McEwan. The award-winning British author says he feels \\"a little dubious\\" about his books being studied in school, especially after his youngest son got a C+ on his McEwan essay several years ago, the Telegraph reports. He says son Greg had to read novel Enduring Love as homework, reports the Times of London. \\"Compelled to read his dad’s book—imagine, poor guy,\\" he says. \\"I confess I did give him a tutorial and told him what he should consider,\\" McEwan says. \\"I didn't read his essay but it turned out his teacher disagreed fundamentally with what he said.\\"","output":"Title: Even Ian McEwan's Help Couldn't Get His Son an A on Essay about His Novel In an ironic twist of fate, it appears that not even the legendary, award-winning British author Ian McEwan could help his own son earn a top grade on an essay about McEwan’s novel, Enduring Love. The teenager scored a C+ several years ago, despite receiving a personal tutorial from his father on the book's themes and subject matter. This anecdote, reported by the Telegraph, raises questions about literature studies in schools and the potential disconnect between an author's intentions and the interpretations brought forth by readers, including teachers. To start with, the unusual situation involving McEwan's son, Greg, began when he was assigned Enduring Love as a part of his school homework. To say that the young man found himself under pressure would be an understatement, as the expectations for such an assignment would be extremely high considering his father is the author. As Ian McEwan himself stated, his son was \\"compelled to read his dad’s book—imagine, poor guy.\\" The author went on to acknowledge that he did provide a tutorial to his son, attempting to explain what aspects of the novel he should consider when writing his essay. However, McEwan did not read the final draft of the essay, allowing his son to retain his own voice and insights. Nonetheless, the young McEwan found out that his teacher disagreed fundamentally with the points made in his paper – which, in a way, were also the insights of the author himself. The teacher's disagreement with McEwan's points serves as a reminder that literature and its interpretation can often be a highly subjective experience. Perhaps, the educator was looking for a particular train of thought or a specific argument that the student's essay didn't address. Or, it could simply be a difference of interpretation, as readers may approach a work of literature with a distinct set of experiences and perspectives. This subjective nature of literary analysis calls into question the rigidity of the grading system and the extent to which a student's understanding of a complex work can be accurately measured. Nevertheless, one must consider Ian McEwan's own feelings towards his works being studied in schools. The author admits feeling \\"a little dubious\\" about this scenario, as literature studied in an academic setting can so easily create a dichotomy between the author's intentions and the pedagogical expectations. Moreover, it raises concerns about the weight students and educators give to authorial intention, and the debate surrounding its importance in literary analysis. Regardless of the grading outcome, it is important to recognize that Greg McEwan's C+ serves as a humorous and enlightening anecdote for those in academia, literature enthusiasts, and authors alike - emphasizing that despite the fame and numerous awards Ian McEwan has garnered, even his guidance could not ensure an A for an essay on his own work. This incident opens up a broader conversation about the process of analyzing, interpreting, and grading literary works in schools, and prompts the wider education community to question the effectiveness of the current methods - especially when an author's own son receives a less-than-stellar grade on an essay about his father's novel, despite the author's assistance. Overall, the incident involving Ian McEwan and his son Greg sheds light on the subjective nature of literary analysis and the potential gaps between an author's intentions, readers' perspectives, and educators' expectations. It also raises valid questions regarding the current system of evaluating works of literature, fostering insightful discussion amongst academia and readers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight.

According to the study's abstract, researchers set up a deception paradigm in which participants \\"believed they were engaged in a computer-mediated mock jury deliberation about a murder case.\\"      Unbeknownst to the study's participants, the other jurors in the simulation were simply reading lines. Of the five other jury members in the mock trial, four were scripted to agree with the study participant's verdict of the case; one juror was a holdout. When the holdout was labeled with a \\"male\\" name and expressed angered dissent against the participant's verdict, the participant was more likely to question themselves. When the holdout juror, following the same script, expressed anger and was identified by a typically female name, study participants were more likely to trust their initial verdict and not question themselves.      Anger is a really justified response to the world we live in.      Dr. Jeanne Vaccaro is a postdoctoral fellow in gender studies at Indiana University and a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. \\"My initial reaction [to this study] is thinking about hysteria,\\" she says, \\"and the historical use of hysteria to pathologize women—any kind of eruption being seen as irrational as opposed to grounded.\\"      Dr. Vaccaro says that the perception of women as irrational is deeply ingrained in the contemporary cultural psyche. Sexist beliefs manifest in the unconscious; people are often totally unaware of the biases they're carrying around. \\"There's this really strong pairing of the feminine and the hysterical; they've been sutured together,\\" she says. \\"Even the etymology of the word uterus traces back to hysteria. In the Victorian era they sent women off to the sanatorium to 'relax' or whatever after these [hysterical] 'episodes.'\\"            Read More: The History of Female Anger      The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is an internationally recognized medical tool. Historically oppressed demographics have often been classified as disorders in it. The status quo of neutral persons has long been defined by straight, white, cisgender, and heterosexual males, and the behavior of people who don't qualify as neutral persons has long been pathologized in the DSM. This is not inconsequential, as the DSM is considered to represent scientific fact about the human mind.      As social justice movements progress and change society, concrete manifestations of discrimination are often the first to go. Policy and legislation reform attempt to level out inequality. In 1973, in the wake of the gay liberation movement, for example, homosexuality was famously declassified as a mental disorder and removed from the DSM.      Right now, it's very important in our world that people are allowed to be angry.      Dr. Vaccaro explains that it's the same with hysteria, which was declassified in the 1950s. But, she says, a change in the documentation of cultural bias doesn't mean the stereotype is gone. \\"There are other things that have appeared in the wake of hysteria. We still have the legacy that women aren't rational.\\"      According to Dr. Vaccaro, some people have even suggested that the gender bias inherent in hysteria shifted after hysteria was declassified and is now manifest in the way physicians dismiss medical conditions like fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, and chronic fatigue. \\"Even though there's no longer hysteria as a diagnosis, people have said these new diseases have come to fill this gap left by hysteria,\\" she says. \\"Female patients complain of not being listened to by their doctors. These are people who report experiencing chronic pain. You go to the doctor over and over again, and nobody listens.\\"      The form of persistent bias seen in the unsettling results of this study isn't exclusive to women, Dr. Vaccaro adds. Like the pathologization of difference, emotions of historically oppressed demographics are often not taken seriously on a person-to-person level, such as when the anger of people of color is written off or used against them. \\"People should and can be really angry about post-colonialism, institutional racism, everyday racism, or everyday sexism. Anger is a really justified response to the world we live in.\\"      These biases are not inconsequential. Female survivors of sexual assault, for example, fear social persecution, which makes them much less likely to speak out against their rapists or abusers. Anger is a natural response to assault, but when being angry is likely to undermine your case, it's much more difficult to step forward—and thus much more difficult to move on, or share your story to help other victims.      \\"Right now, it's very important in our world that people are allowed to be angry,\\" Dr. Vaccaro says. \\"Angry at the police, or angry at sexism.\\" She explains that anger is a right, and that it's threatening because it disrupts the sexist order of things. \\"It's like you're being defiant, you're being political, you're resisting the status quo. That upsets people who have a stake in power relations as they currently are. Their power is antagonized by resistance. [But] how could you not be angry?\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"A recent study in Law and Human Behavior found that anger in women is less influential than in men. Participants in a mock jury scenario were more likely to question themselves when a holdout juror expressing anger was labelled with a male name, but trusted their initial verdict if the holdout had a female name. Dr. Vaccaro, a postdoctoral fellow in gender studies, argues that the perception of women as irrational and hysterical is deeply ingrained in our cultural consciousness and has historical roots. She stresses the importance of allowing people, especially historically oppressed demographics, to express anger as a valid response to the injustices they face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Sydney was volunteering to build a house, and they did an excellent job yesterday.  Given the context: How would Others feel as a result?  Possible answers: like they should just not show up, accomplished, trying to show off The answer is:","output":"Others would most likely feel a combination of emotions as a result of Sydney's excellent performance while volunteering to build a house. It is important to recognize and understand the nuances of human emotions and behavioral responses in a community-based project like this one. Here are some possible ways others might feel: 1. Accomplished: Seeing Sydney doing such an excellent job might serve as a reminder to others of their collective mission and a source of motivation. When individuals observe their peers performing admirably, it can inspire them to put forth their best efforts as well. This sense of shared accomplishment can bolster team morale and help the entire group work more effectively together. 2. Challenged: Some individuals may view Sydney's contribution as a benchmark to aim for. This can result in a healthy sense of competition, encouraging them to raise the quality of their work to match or surpass Sydney's contributions. When managed properly, a bit of competition can drive individuals to strive for greater levels of excellence, benefiting the overall project. 3. Appreciative: Those who have been struggling with their tasks or feeling uncertain about how to approach them can find inspiration in Sydney's work. They may feel grateful for having such a skilled volunteer in their midst who can provide guidance or assistance in refining their own skillsets. Moreover, Sydney's dedication to volunteering can inspire gratitude and appreciation for their selflessness and commitment. 4. Insecure: It is possible that those who feel their performance pales in comparison to Sydney's might begin to feel insecure or inadequate. When others compare themselves to someone who is excelling, it can lead to feelings of self-doubt and a diminished sense of self-worth. In these instances, it's important for members of the team to provide reassurance and support while reminding each other that everyone contributes uniquely to the project's success. 5. Motivated to improve: For some, seeing Sydney's success could serve as a wake-up call, forcing them to reassess their abilities and approach to the task. In this case, individuals might feel motivated to learn from Sydney and hone their skills, ultimately leading to an overall improvement within the group. 6. Resentful: Unfortunately, there may be those who view Sydney's exceptional performance as an attempt to show off or elevate themselves above the rest of the team. These individuals might feel resentment towards Sydney, even if their intentions were purely to contribute positively to the project. It is crucial to address any misunderstandings and ensure clear communication among team members to mitigate potential conflicts. Ultimately, the way others feel in response to Sydney's excellent job while volunteering to build a house will depend on individual perspectives, personal experiences, and the dynamics within the group. The key is to foster a positive and supportive environment where everyone's contributions are valued, and concerns or insecurities are addressed constructively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.

Question:   Something with a lot of energy travels short distances or long distances?    Text:  However, the energy is diluted as an electromagnetic wave travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area. The answer is:","output":"Based on the provided text, something with a lot of energy may initially travel short or long distances, but its energy will gradually decrease as it travels farther from its source. This is because the energy will be diluted and spreads out over an ever-larger area as the electromagnetic wave moves away from its origin. It's essential to understand that the distance that an object or wave with a lot of energy can travel can be influenced by various factors, such as the medium it is traveling through and any obstacles or interference present in its path. In the context of the given text, the focus is on the dilution of energy as an electromagnetic wave travels away from its source. Electromagnetic waves can propagate through different media, such as air, water, or vacuum, which can affect their energy and overall travel distance. For instance, the energy of electromagnetic waves tends to attenuate more quickly when traveling through denser media, such as water, as opposed to less dense mediums, like air. Additionally, the presence of obstacles, such as buildings or mountains, might also affect the wave's travel distance and energy conservation. Moreover, the initial energy of an electromagnetic wave will play a crucial role in determining the distance it can travel before its energy is considerably diluted. A wave with a substantial amount of energy may be able to travel greater distances before its energy becomes too dispersed to be of any practical use, whereas a wave with less energy may lose its effectiveness over shorter distances. In summary, while something with a lot of energy has the potential to travel both short and long distances, the specific circumstances involved, such as the medium and any potential obstacles, will significantly impact the distance it can effectively travel. In the context of electromagnetic waves, as they travel farther from their source, their energy will be diluted over a larger area, which can weaken the effect or impact of the wave at greater distances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is significant about cardinals? Context: At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation. The answer to this question is:","output":"The significant aspect about cardinals is that, since the revision of the Code of Canon Law in 1917, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

Information:  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

Summarize this article: Lower class men in the Renaissance often wore what's called a poet shirt. This is a baggy shirt with large long sleeves, almost always white or off-white. Think of a classic pirate shirt. Look for one made of a natural fabric like cotton or linen.  You can choose a different color if you want. Brown and olive green work well. Instead of a poet shirt, you can opt for a tunic if you wish. These are long-sleeved shirts that go lower than normal shirts. Look for something in a natural color and of a natural material. You might already own some cotton trousers that will work for the garb. If not, look for some in a dark color, dark brown or black. They should be long enough to tuck into boots. Fabric is the most important factor here. They didn't have denim back then, and plain khaki pants won't look right either. Look for a light fabric, preferably cotton or linen, or something that looks like cotton or linen. Alternatively, you can look for pants that come down to just past or just above the knee. If you can sew elastic into the openings to make them resemble bloomers, even better. The vest will make your basic male garb complete, besides the shoes and accessories. The vest should be dark colored like the pants, and simple and plain. A leather vest would be ideal, but you have a lot of freedom with fabrics here, so just look for something that you like the look of. Boots will complete your look, as your trousers should be tucked into them. Look for the most nondescript, basic black or brown leather boots you can find. Something like cowboy boots will not fit in.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... Question: What do most people think about creativity? Options:  A. It does not exist  B. not enough information  C. It is difficult to define  D.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie? is inside the article: Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten.

Here's how soil can be an endless resource for a plant to expand: Step 1: Understanding the composition of soil To ensure that soil remains a renewable resource, it is essential to understand its composition. Soil is made up of a mixture of minerals, organic matter, water, and air. The minerals come from weathered rocks, while the organic matter comes from decomposed plants and animals. Step 2: Maintaining soil fertility One of the key aspects of maintaining soil as a renewable resource is ensuring its fertility. This can be done by adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to the soil. Organic matter improves the soil structure, helps retain moisture, and provides nutrients to plants. Regularly adding organic matter to the soil will help maintain its fertility, allowing plants to continue growing and expanding. Step 3: Crop rotation Another important practice to maintain soil as a renewable resource is crop rotation. This involves periodically changing the type of crop grown in a specific area. Different plants have different nutrient requirements and can help prevent soil depletion by not using the same nutrients continuously. For example, growing legumes, which fix nitrogen in the soil, can help replenish nitrogen levels for subsequent crops. Step 4: Soil conservation practices To ensure that soil remains a renewable resource, it is essential to prevent soil erosion and degradation. This can be achieved through various soil conservation practices, such as contour farming, terracing, and planting cover crops. These practices help to maintain the soil structure, prevent runoff, and protect against nutrient loss. Step 5: Monitoring soil health Regularly testing the soil's nutrient levels, pH, and physical structure will help determine its overall health. By monitoring soil health, appropriate adjustments can be made to ensure it remains a renewable resource for growing and expanding plants. In summary, by understanding the composition of soil, maintaining its fertility, practicing crop rotation, implementing soil conservation measures, and monitoring its health, soil can be an endless resource for a plant that needs to expand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. a: \\"i prefer not to infuse the distinctions into the works themselves. Make this proper case.","output":"A: \\"I prefer not to infuse the distinctions into the works themselves.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing their preference to avoid making clear distinctions within their works. They might be referring to artistic, literary, or any other form of creative expression. By choosing not to emphasize these distinctions, the creator allows for a more open interpretation and a wider range of potential meanings or perspectives for the audience. This can be particularly effective in thought-provoking works, where purposeful ambiguity can challenge the audience to think more deeply, consider multiple viewpoints, and draw their own conclusions. One of the reasons a creator might choose not to infuse distinctions into their work is that they want to encourage audiences to look beyond categories and explore the nuances that lie in between. For example, in a literary work, the author may want readers to think more deeply about the characters and themes, rather than simply labeling them as \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" Instead, the author may leave the reader with complex character portrayals that force them to examine their own biases and presumptions. Another reason a creator might prefer not to infuse distinctions into their works is to break down barriers and challenge established norms. Artists and writers who belong to marginalized groups or who challenge societal conventions may intentionally avoid distinctions to resist conformity and facilitate conversations about identity, culture, and social issues. Additionally, by not infusing distinctions into a work, the creator can foster an open dialogue amongst the audience, allowing people with different perspectives to find common ground and debate the meanings and implications of the work. In this way, a work that lacks distinctions can become a platform for collective conversation and reflection. In summary, choosing not to infuse distinctions into a work can lead to a more thought-provoking and open-ended experience for the audience. Such works can stimulate discourse, invite diverse interpretations, encourage self-reflection, and challenge prevailing norms while promoting critical thinking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Q: Context_1 : Michael Honywood D.D. (1597 – 7 December, 1681) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1660. Horwood was a bibliophile and he founded and funded the Lincoln Cathedral Library. Context_2 : Robert Bloet (sometimes Robert Bloett; died 1123) was Bishop of Lincoln 1093-1123 and Chancellor of England. Born into a noble Norman family, he became a royal clerk under King William I. Under William I's son and successor King William II, Bloet was first named chancellor then appointed to the See of Lincoln. Continuing to serve the king while bishop, Bloet remained a close royal councillor to William II's successor, King Henry I. He did much to embellish Lincoln Cathedral, and gave generously to his cathedral and other religious houses. He educated a number of noblemen, including illegitimate children of Henry I. He also was the patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and was an early patron of Gilbert of Sempringham, the founder of the Gilbertine monastic order. Context_3 : Sincil Bank is a football stadium in Lincoln, England which has been the home of Lincoln City since 1895. Previously, Lincoln City had played at the nearby John O'Gaunts ground since the club's 1884 inception. Sincil Bank has an overall capacity of 10,120 and is colloquially known to fans as \\"Sinny Bank\\". It is overlooked by Lincoln Cathedral. Former Lincoln City chairman John Reames re-purchased the ground from the local council in 2000 at a cost of £175,000. The club had sold it in 1982 for £225,000 in order to fend off the threat of eviction, arranging a 125-year lease. Context_4 : Colin Walsh is an English organist, who has played many recitals in various religious venues in England as well as two at the Royal Festival Hall. He has also played in many European countries and New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the USA. Some of his work has been released on the Priory label. He has worked as an organist or assistant organist at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle; Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford; Salisbury Cathedral (1978-1985); St. Albans Cathedral (1985-1988); and Lincoln Cathedral. In July 2002 there were plans to sack Walsh, whom The Telegraph described as \\"one of Europe's finest church organists\\", after differences with the Precentor, Andrew Stokes; however this plan was dropped and he was given a new role. Since January 2003 he has been Organist Laureate of Lincoln Cathedral. Context_5 : Abraham Haywood (1692–1747) was an architect who was born at Whitchurch, Shropshire and is likely to have come to Lincoln around 1720 to work for Francis Smith of Warwick on the construction of St Peter at Arches Church, Lincoln. In 1736 he built the town house of the Disney family, Disney Place in Eastgate Street, Lincoln and in 1744 the Lincoln Assembly Rooms in the Bail, Lincoln. He also built a house for himself on the east side of St Peter at Arches‘ graveyard on the site of the Lincoln Taylor’s Hall. Abraham Hayward’s younger brother John Hayward(1708-78), a mason by trade, also accompanied him to Lincoln. After Abraham’s death, he presumably continued the business and in 1753 rebuilt St Mary’s bridge in Lincoln. John Hayward’s grandson, William Hayward became surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral. Context_6 : William Haywood (died probably in 1823) was an architect who worked in Lincoln, England. His father John who died in 1817 was mayor of Lincoln twice and worked as a mason. Haywood succeeded his father as mayor after his death in 1817. His grandfather, John Hayward (1708–78) was also a mason in Lincoln. William Hayward's great grandfather was Abraham Haywood an architect of Whitchurch, Shropshire who came to Lincoln around 1720. William Haywood succeeded William Lumby as Surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral in 1799 and Edward James Willson followed him in this position in 1823. William Hayward also succeeded William Lumby as Surveyor for the Lincolnshire County County Committee, which had responsibility for Lincoln Castle and the prison. Context_7 : Lincoln Cathedral or the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, and sometimes St. Mary's Cathedral in Lincoln, England is the seat of the Anglican bishop. Building commenced in 1088 and continued in several phases throughout the medieval period. It was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311–1549), and the first building to hold that title after the Great Pyramid of Giza. The central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt. The cathedral is the third largest in Britain (in floor area) after St Paul's and York Minster, being 484 by . It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the eminent Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: \\"I have always held... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.\\" Context_8 : William John Butler (1818–1894) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1885 until his death. He was previously Vicar of the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wantage from 1847 to 1881, where he founded the Community of St Mary the Virgin. Context_9 : The Dean of Lincoln is the head of the Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral in the city of Lincoln, England in the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln. Christine Wilson was installed as Dean on 22 October 2016. Context_10 : The Old Bishop's Palace is an historic visitor attraction in the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire. When it was first built, in the late 12th century, it was at the centre of the vast Diocese of Lincoln, which stretched from the Humber to the Thames. The Palace was one of the most impressive buildings of medieval England, reflecting the power and wealth of Lincoln’s bishops. It is situated on a spectacular hillside site, just below Lincoln cathedral, providing extensive views over the city. The site lies immediately to the south of the Roman wall which had become the medieval defensive wall of the \\"Bail\\", which enclosed both Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. The palace was damaged during the Civil War and subsequently largely abandoned. During the period that followed the Bishop’s main residence was Buckden Palace in Huntingdonshire. In 1841, following the reduction in size of the Diocese of Lincoln, the Bishop moved to Riseholme, to the north of Lincoln. This proved inconvenient and Riseholme was sold. In 1886 an older building on the western side of the Palace enclosure was substantially rebuilt and enlarged in a Tudor revival style by the architect Ewan Christian. A further change occurred in 1888 when the architects Bodley and Garner rebuilt and converted the southern portion of the medieval Great Hall into a chapel for the Bishop. fact_1 : William John Butler (1818–1894) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1885 until his death. fact_2 : The Dean of Lincoln is the head of the Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral in the city of Lincoln, England in the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln.

The buildings were drawn in 1937, but were only built for André Jaoul and his son Michel post-war period. In the first phrase, the emphasis is on the fact that the buildings were designed or planned (drawn) in 1937. However, they were constructed for André Jaoul and his son Michel during the post-war period. This statement implies that there was a gap between the time the buildings were designed and when they were actually built, possibly due to the war. 2. The buildings were built in 1937 but were only drawn postwar for André Jaoul and his son Michel. In the second phrase, it is said that the buildings were constructed in 1937, but the designs or plans (drawn) were done after the war. This statement is somewhat self-contradictory, suggesting that the buildings were built before their designs were completed.

They have 7 different types of meat to fill your menu item with and my favorite is Don Rafa Style which is carne asada and melted cheese with green chile.  The chips and salsa are hard to stay out of before you dig into your meal.  Their burritos are big and also very good.  I was a little disappointed with the sopapillas because they weren't doughy and were basically a fried wonton with cinnamon and sugar on it.  The service is really good and all of the waitstaff are very nice.  On the outside of the restaurant they promote a pretty good deal on a bucket of Corona, but I can't remember the exact amount.

Is Bloodborne hard? OPT: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","output":"[1]. No, these two questions do not have the same meaning or address the same aspect of Bloodborne. The first question is asking about the relationship between the Bloodborne universe or story and the Demon's Souls universe or story. To answer this question in detail, Bloodborne and Demon's Souls are both action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. They share similarities in gameplay mechanics, dark themes, and challenging difficulty levels. However, they do not share the same universe or story. Demon's Souls is set in the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, while Bloodborne takes place in the gothic city of Yharnam. Although both games share thematic elements related to darkness, suffering, and ambiguous storytelling, their plots, characters, and settings are distinct, and they are not considered part of the same series. The second question is asking about the difficulty level of Bloodborne. Bloodborne, like the other Souls games, including Demon's Souls, is widely regarded as a challenging game. The game features a steep learning curve, punishing combat mechanics, and minimal hand-holding for players. Enemies and bosses are designed to be difficult and require strategy, experimentation, and perseverance to overcome. The difficulty in Bloodborne primarily comes from its deliberately precise and responsive combat system, which demands skill and timing from the player, along with the intentionally opaque story and mechanics that encourage exploration and discovery. Many gamers consider this high level of challenge to be a core aspect of Bloodborne's gameplay experience, and it is one of the features that has made the game popular among fans of the Soulsborne series (which includes the games Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne). In summary, while these two questions both relate to aspects of Bloodborne, they do not have the same meaning. The first question concerns the connection between Bloodborne and Demon's Souls in terms of their universe and story, while the second question specifically focuses on Bloodborne's difficulty level. The two questions serve separate purposes, factually and contextually, as they address different aspects of the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The LSAT is a half-day standardized test that is administered four times each year (increased to six starting from the 2018-2019 academic year) at designated testing centers throughout the world. The purpose of the LSAT is to evaluate the reading comprehension, logical, and verbal reasoning proficiencies of prospective law school candidates.  The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is the organization responsible for administering the LSAT, which is an essential component of the law school admission process in countries like the United States, Canada (for common law programs only), the University of Melbourne in Australia, and an increasing number of other countries across the globe. The LSAT is divided into several sections that measure the test taker's abilities in different areas of reasoning. The test typically includes the following sections: 1. Reading Comprehension: This section assesses the candidate's ability to read and understand complex materials, which is vital for success in law school. 2. Analytical Reasoning: Also known as the \\"Logic Games\\" section, this part of the test evaluates the candidate's ability to understand relationships and draw logical conclusions. 3. Logical Reasoning: This section, consisting of two parts, assesses the candidate's ability to analyze and evaluate arguments, which is a crucial skill for practicing law. 4. An Experimental Section: This unscored section contains new questions being tested for future LSAT exams. Test takers are unaware of which section is experimental and thus must treat all sections with equal importance. 5. Writing Sample: This section allows the candidate to demonstrate their writing abilities, which are essential for success both in law school and as a legal professional. Law schools take the LSAT scores into account when reviewing applications, along with other factors like undergraduate GPA, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities. Scoring well on the LSAT is important for increasing one's chances of being admitted to law schools, as it is often used as an indicator of a candidate's potential for success in law school and, ultimately, their legal career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Two little girls play in the sand at the beach. Hypothesis: Big boys riding their skateboards. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot directly conclude the hypothesis, as they describe two different scenarios involving different sets of individuals and activities. Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis in a detailed manner to further clarify this point. Premise: Two little girls play in the sand at the beach. This scenario describes the occurrence of an outdoor activity, specifically at a beach setting. It involves two main subjects, both of whom are little girls, and they are engaging in a playful activity of playing in the sand. The focus of the premise is solely on the actions and experiences of these little girls, with no mention of any other individuals or events occurring nearby. Hypothesis: Big boys riding their skateboards. In contrast, the hypothesis introduces a new set of individuals, who are described as big boys. Furthermore, these boys are involved in a completely different activity, which is riding their skateboards. The hypothesis makes no mention of the beach setting or any connection to the two little girls mentioned in the premise. It also does not provide any detailed information regarding the location, time or environment in which this activity is taking place. Given that the premise and hypothesis are each centered around distinct subjects (little girls vs. big boys) and activities (playing in the sand at the beach vs. riding skateboards), we cannot draw any conclusions or make any connections between the two scenarios solely based on the provided information. They appear to be separate occurrences that may or may not be occurring simultaneously or in the same vicinity. To be able to potentially conclude the hypothesis from the premise, there would need to be some linking or overlapping element between the two situations, which is not present in the given descriptions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Playoffs â Rangers Donât Use Carl Hagelin on Power Play BOSTON â The Rangersâ power play has been bafflingly ineffective, and one of the biggest mysteries is why the speedy left wing Carl Hagelin does not skate on it. He is the teamâs second-highest playoff scorer with 5 points in eight games, its plus-minus leader at plus 5, and a player praised often by Coach John Tortorella. So why doesnât Hagelin get a chance on the power play, which is 2 for 31 in the playoffs going into Game 2 against the Boston Bruins on Sunday? âBecause he stinks on the power play,â Tortorella said after the Rangers practiced Saturday. âI donât know why. I wish I could play him on the power play. Every time I put him on, he stinks.â Thus began an extended, entertaining exchange between Tortorella and reporters on Hagelinâs absence from the power play, with Tortorella frequently employing the word âstinks.â âI think heâs too quick,â Tortorella said when asked what Hagelin did wrong on the power play. âI think heâs a jitterbug and he screws it up. But I may use him â Iâd love to. And Iâm not trying to be a smart aleck. He stinks on the power play every time I put him on there.â It was pointed out that plenty of Rangers stink on the power play these days. âYeah, itâs true,â Tortorella said. âThatâs why he may get an opportunity. Iâm not sure if he will or not.â In only his second full season as a professional, Hagelin has earned Tortorellaâs trust to such an extent that he ranks third among Rangers forwards this postseason in even-strength ice time, behind Ryan Callahan and Derek Stepan, and fourth in short-handed ice time. But on the power play, Hagelin has averaged only 13 seconds a game, 10th among Rangers forwards. That was his rank during the regular season as well. In the playoffs, Rick Nash, at 3 minutes 55 seconds a game, and Brad Richards, at 3:54, lead the Rangers in power-play time. The Rangers ranked 23rd in power-play percentage in the regular season, scoring 15.7 percent of the time. And Boston was fourth in penalty kills at 87.1 percent. Tortorella said he had never encountered a player like Hagelin, who does âeverything else wellâ but not the power play. âIt screws me up too, because Iâd like to put him on the power play,â Tortorella said. âBut he stinks on the power play. âI canât figure him out. I love the guy â as Iâve told the guys who cover the team, heâs such an effective player. But as Iâve said here many times, he stinks on the power play.â Tortorella was asked if he had talked to Hagelin about it. âIâve asked him why he stinks on the power play,â Tortorella said, by this time smiling broadly. And what did Hagelin say in response? âNot too much,â Tortorella said. âHeâs a good player. Heâs really important to us, but it just has not worked out there. But he may get an opportunity if we keep on going.â If he does, Hagelin may be eager to prove he doesnât stink on the power play. Brad Marchandâs overtime goal Thursday was the first in a Bruins-Rangers playoff game since March 27, 1958, when Bostonâs Jerry Toppazzini scored the winner in Game 2 of a series the Bruins took in six. ...The former Rangers defenseman Wade Redden, out of the Bruinsâ lineup with an undisclosed injury since Game 6 of the Toronto series, practiced Saturday but said he was not sure he could play on Sunday. Coach Claude Julien said he would make a decision about Redden at game time.","output":"In a hockey game, the Rangers team is having a hard time scoring goals when they have a special chance called a power play. Their coach, John Tortorella, talks about why one of their good players, Carl Hagelin, is not playing during that special chance. He says that Carl is too fast and makes mistakes during that time. Even though Carl is really good at other parts of the game, the coach thinks he's not good at the power play. However, the coach might give Carl a chance to play during the power play in the future games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Article: Windmills dot the landscape,producing a renewable energy source.Our pioneer ancestors established windmills as a means of bringing water to the surface.To tell the truth,the history of wind energy is very long.Since early recorded history,people have been _ the energy of the wind.Wind energy drove boats along the Nile River as early as 5000 BC.By 200 BC,simple windmills in China were pumping water,while well-designed windmills were grinding grain in Persia and the Middle East. New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

The Flammarion engraving that can be frequently seen on book covers sought to illustrate what belief system?","output":"The Flammarion engraving is a wood engraving that has become quite famous and is often seen on book covers, especially those related to science, astronomy, and cosmology. Its striking imagery features a man, often interpreted as a medieval scholar or seeker of knowledge, who is peering through the boundaries of the Earth's sky and gazing at the celestial realm beyond. Named after French astronomer Camille Flammarion, it initially appeared in his book \\"L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire\\" published in 1888. Although Camille Flammarion was a scientist, the engraving itself is a more symbolic representation that encompasses a mixture of philosophical and religious beliefs, capturing the historic human quest to understand the universe and its mysteries. By examining the imagery of the engraving and the intellectual context of the time, we can discern a few main belief systems that it sought to illustrate. 1. The intersection of science and religion: The Flammarion engraving draws upon medieval cosmology, which was deeply influenced by religious beliefs. During the Middle Ages, European scholars often believed in a geocentric universe, with the Earth at the center, enveloped by celestial spheres with the stars, planets, and the heavens beyond. This cosmological model is partly drawn from the works of thinkers like Ptolemy and Aristotle, and it also resonated with the prevailing Christian idea of the heavens being a place of divine order, harmony, and the dwelling of God. The engraving can be seen as showcasing this blend of scientific and religious ideas. 2. The transition from geocentric to heliocentric cosmology: The intellectual context of the Flammarion engraving is critical to understanding its significance. With the advent of the Renaissance and the development of innovative astronomical ideas by Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, the longstanding belief in a geocentric universe was replaced by the heliocentric model, where the Sun was at the center. The engraving can be seen as symbolizing the moment of transition, where the man's act of peering through the celestial boundary represents the growing awareness that, contrary to traditional beliefs, there might be a deeper, more complex reality beyond the known universe. 3. The human pursuit of knowledge and understanding: The Flammarion engraving ultimately embodies the unquenchable human desire to explore, question, and discover the truth about our world and the universe we inhabit. The figure of the scholar or traveler on a cosmic journey to seek knowledge reflects a universal experience of humanity's pursuit of understanding. It is a stark reminder that our understanding of the cosmos is ever-evolving, and we must continue to push the boundaries of what we know and believe. In summary, the Flammarion engraving sought to illustrate a blend of philosophical and religious beliefs tied to the human quest for knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. It represents the intersection of science and religion, the transition from geocentric to heliocentric cosmological models, and the human pursuit of knowledge in the face of ever-evolving and unfolding mysteries of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is justified because the stated perturbation (less rain) doesn't directly affect a particular step in the process, but rather influences the conditions under which the process occurs. That is, if there is less rain, it means that the second and third steps of the process (\\"Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone\\" and \\"cause an acidic reaction\\") will not take place as often or as intensively.

Initial investments: a: Rs. 8000 b: Rs. 10000 c: Rs. 12000 GCD(8000, 10000, 12000) = 2000 Ratio of investments: a: 8000 / 2000 = 4 b: 10000 / 2000 = 5 c: 12000 / 2000 = 6 So, the investment ratio is 4:5:6. Step 2: Find the total profit We know that B's profit is Rs. 1700, and his investment ratio is 5. To find the total profit, we'll first determine what fraction of the total profit B's share is, then multiply by B's profit.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 for x.","output":"To solve the equation -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, simplify the right side of the equation by combining the terms with x. The right side of the equation is: 239x - 111x + 50x Combine the terms: (239 - 111 + 50)x = 178x So the simplified equation is: -142x = 178x + 11840 Step 2: Move all the terms containing x to one side of the equation. In order to do this, we will add 142x to both sides of the equation. -142x + 142x = 178x + 142x + 11840 This simplifies to: 0 = 320x + 11840 Step 3: Isolate x. Now, we can isolate x by moving constants to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 11840 from both sides. 0 - 11840 = 320x + 11840 - 11840 This simplifies to: -11840 = 320x Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 320 to solve for x: x = -11840 / 320 Step 4: Simplify the solution (if possible). In this case, both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction are divisible by 40. x = (-11840 ÷ 40) / (320 ÷ 40) x = -296 / 8 Now divide -296 by 8: x = -37 Thus, the solution to the equation -142*x = 239*x - 111*x + 50*x + 11840 is x = -37."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My job didn't provide me with enough money to buy a truck, because the  Available options:  *money was little..  *truck was little..","output":"My job didn't provide me with enough money to buy a truck, because the money was little. It was quite frustrating, as I had always wanted to own a truck to help transport heavy items and enjoy adventurous road trips with my friends. My job, being an entry-level position, came with a low salary that only allowed me to cover my basic living expenses.  I began exploring ways to increase my income or find alternate means to finance my dream truck. I knew it was an uphill battle, but I remained determined. I began by setting up a budget, outlining my necessary expenses, and allocating a portion of my income towards saving for the truck. This was a slow process, but I knew that every penny saved brought me one step closer to my goal. In addition to my budgeting efforts, I decided to search for additional sources of income. Freelance work seemed like the perfect way to expand my earning potential while maintaining control of the number of hours I invested. I started offering my skills in graphic design, web development, and writing to others in need of such services. Since these were skills that I already possessed, it wasn't too difficult to find clients willing to pay for my expertise.  Over time, my freelance work became increasingly successful, and I was able to earn more than what I initially anticipated. With the extra income, I also started to pay more attention to my finances and sought ways to minimize my expenses further. I began shopping at more affordable grocery stores and eliminated any unnecessary costs, such as dining out and daily trips to the coffee shops. To speed up the process of buying my dream truck, I looked into available financing options. Banks and credit unions offered auto loans, but the interest rates varied significantly between lenders. As I compared loan terms, it was essential to factor in not just the interest rate, but also the duration of the loan and additional fees, to find the most favorable option. A friend recommended exploring manufacturer financing promotions, as they occasionally ran special programs that offered low or even 0% interest rates. This proved to be an invaluable tip, as I was able to identify a fantastic deal during a promotional period. The lower interest rate meant that I could afford a larger loan and therefore, a more appealing truck. Finally, with months of determination, budgeting, extra work, and thorough research, I was able to put together enough funds to purchase my dream truck. It was a challenging journey filled with obstacles and moments of doubt, but the experience taught me valuable lessons about financial planning, resourcefulness, and perseverance.

Title: Oshun: Santeria and the Orisha of Love, Rivers and Sensuality Product review: Frankly, I've not read this book, nor do I intend to. I was searching for information on the AFRICAN religious traditions. Oshun is an AFRICAN Orisha, so how the heck does she turn out to be a white woman on the cover of a book about Oshun??? I will reserve my time and money for the books that truly depict the ethnicity of the traditions and people they evolved from, not some white washed reinterpretation of an ancient AFRICAN gift to the world. As the saying goes, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\". The so called author of Oshun: Santeria and the Orisha of Love, Rivers and Sensuality should be ashamed of what appears to be yet another attempt to erase the cultural influences of African peoples and credit them to Europeans instead. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer is dissatisfied and offended by the portrayal of an African deity (Oshun) as a white woman on the cover of the book. They view this as a misrepresentation and cultural erasure, hence their decision not to purchase or read it. Furthermore, they express a lack of trust for the author's authentic depiction of African religious traditions. All these aspects contribute to the unflattering light in which the product is presented."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 11 Welsh Tory MPs voted with the government. Four Welsh Labour MPs - Stephen Doughty, Chris Bryant, Wayne David and Susan Elan Jones - voted with the government. Twenty of the 25 Welsh Labour MPs voted against air strikes, including shadow cabinet members Nia Griffith and Owen Smith. They were joined by Kevin Brennan, Geraint Davies, Chris Evans, David Hanson, Paul Flynn, Carolyn Harris, Huw Irranca-Davies, Gerald Jones, Stephen Kinnock, Ian Lucas, Madeleine Moon, Christina Rees, Jo Stevens, Nick Smith, Mark Tami and Nick Thomas-Symonds, Wales's only Liberal Democrat MP, Mark Williams, defied his party leadership to vote against military action.

Possible A: close fitting, careful, compact, discreet, faithful  Why is \\"discreet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Discreet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context, meaning, and requirements of the scenario presented in the question. Let's break down the question and explain how \\"discreet\\" connects with the essence of the situation and why it's a fitting choice. Loose lips sink ships: This phrase originated during World War II and encourages people to be careful and secretive with sensitive or confidential information. Revealing such information could lead to disastrous consequences – metaphorically, sinking ships. Hence, the expression advises people to exercise caution when speaking about delicate matters. Surprise party: A surprise party relies on secrecy and confidentiality. The main goal is to organize a celebration without the knowledge of the guest of honor. To maintain the element of surprise, those involved in the planning process need to keep the information confidential and hidden from the guest of honor. A party planner who can effectively keep a secret will ensure the success of the surprise. Now, let's examine the possible answers and determine why \\"discreet\\" is the most appropriate in this context, as per human common sense. 1. Close fitting: This term generally refers to tight or well-fitted items, such as clothing. It may not fit the context, as it doesn't hold any direct relevance to secrecy or confidentiality. 2. Careful: While being careful can mean being cautious, in general, this term is too broad and doesn't specifically imply the ability to maintain confidentiality. 3. Compact: Typically used to describe something small or compressed, this term doesn't relate to the concept of secrecy or discretion. 4. Discreet: This term directly implies prudence, subtlety, and cautious behavior, especially while handling sensitive information. It's synonymous with maintaining confidentiality and keeping secrets. In the context of planning a surprise party, being discreet is crucial to ensure the celebration remains a secret until the big reveal. 5. Faithful: While being faithful can mean being loyal or reliable, it doesn't primarily suggest an ability to maintain confidentiality or keep secrets. In conclusion, \\"discreet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the need for secrecy, confidentiality, and cautious behavior in the planning of a surprise party. It encompasses the essence of the phrase \\"loose lips sink ships\\" and meets the requirements of the specific situation. Discreet party planners are adept at handling sensitive information, ensuring the surprise party will remain undisclosed and successful."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Temindung Airport ( IATA : SRI , ICAO : WALS ) is the airport of Samarinda ( from 1974 ) .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com?

Write a text based on \\"tibetan detainees in nepal start hunger strike\\" Text:","output":"Title: Tibetan Detainees in Nepal Begin Hunger Strike: A Cry for Justice and Freedom Introduction In recent years, tensions and conflicts between Tibet and its neighboring countries have made headlines globally. Amidst the turmoil, many Tibetan refugees and activists have sought refuge in nearby nations, hoping for a safe haven. Nepal, strategically located between India and China, has provided temporary shelter to thousands of Tibetan exiles. Unfortunately, as the political situation worsens, Tibetan detainees in Nepal have begun a hunger strike in protest against their poor treatment and deteriorating conditions. Background: Political Struggles and Tibetan Refugees in Nepal The roots of this desperate ordeal lie within the longstanding political struggles between Tibet and China. In 1950, China invaded Tibet, leading to the forcible annexation of the region. This event has since sparked countless atrocities, human rights violations, and a harsh crackdown on Tibetan culture. As a result, thousands of Tibetans have fled their homeland in search of a better life. Nepal has long been a transit point for these refugees, providing temporary shelter and transit facilities to Tibetans on their journey to India and other countries. However, numerous challenges impede their smooth resettlement. Chinese pressure on Nepal to suppress Tibetan activism and halt the flow of refugees has led to increasing restrictions, raids on refugee camps, arbitrary arrests, and discrimination against Tibetans. The Hunger Strike: A Desperate Call for Attention and Change Frustrated by limited progress and deteriorating conditions, Tibetan detainees in Nepal have decided to embark on a hunger strike. This drastic move signals their desperation to bring global attention to their plight and pursue justice, human rights, and protection from the Nepali government. The hunger strike highlights the inadequate facilities and resources dedicated to Tibetan detainees in Nepal, demonstrating the urgent need for intervention and improvement. The refugees face various challenges, including overcrowded detention centers, limited access to healthcare, and poor sanitary conditions. In addition, prolonged pretrial detentions, lack of legal representation, and unfair trials point to a broader disregard for due process and refugee rights. International Response and Possible Outcomes The Tibetan detainees' hunger strike has attracted widespread attention from international human rights organizations and governments alike. Proponents argue that their cause is justified, as their living conditions are unbearable, and their basic human rights have been systematically violated. Moreover, the refugees have been subjected to prejudice and discrimination by Nepali authorities, subjecting them to random arrests, the confiscation of their identity papers, and limited access to vital services. To mitigate the crisis, there is a need for a coordinated global effort to pressure both the Nepali and Chinese governments into respecting the rights of these vulnerable detainees. By advocating for more equitable treatment and pushing for their release, the international community can help put an end to this humanitarian crisis. Conclusion The hunger strike initiated by Tibetan detainees in Nepal reflects a desperate cry for justice and freedom from an oppressed community. As the world's attention is drawn to their ordeal, it is crucial for the international community to step up efforts to resolve this human rights crisis. By recognizing the Tibetan refugees' plight and holding both the Nepali and Chinese governments accountable for their actions, we can hopefully pave the way for a better future for these detainees who seek nothing but a safe space to call their home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The storyline is shallow and poorly executed, containing more plot holes than a block of Swiss cheese. The actors, unable to breathe life into their one-dimensional roles, give performances that feel forced and uninspired. On top of these issues, the film's heavy reliance on overused visual effects only serves to highlight its lack of originality. The movie's creators attempted to paper over weak plot points and character development with flashy explosions and computer-generated imagery, but ultimately, it falls flat.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your story that continues the following story. In his yard, Michael doesn't compost things, while Benjamin does, so  Possible answers: + Michael is less environmentally conscious.; + Benjamin is less environmentally conscious.;","output":"Michael is notably missing out on the benefits of composting, an activity that Benjamin has wholeheartedly embraced.  We must deduce that Michael is less environmentally conscious. Composting, while appearing to be an activity of simply recycling organic household waste--like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells--is in fact a powerful tool in mitigating the effects of climate change and promoting sustainable practices. It is an eco-friendly way to process waste while creating nutrient-rich soil for gardening and landscaping. Plus, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, lowers our carbon footprint, and decreases methane production in landfills, one of the key culprits for global warming. On the other hand, for Benjamin, composting is more than just smart waste handling; it is a lifestyle choice that reflects his environmental consciousness. Through this daily practice, he showcases his role as a responsible citizen who actively minimizes waste, encourages soil health, and contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While Michael's reluctance to compost might stem from a lack of knowledge or practical considerations such as space constraints or an aversion to potential odours, it is perceivable as a decision that lends less thought to the environment. Though he might be greener in other ways, his lack of composting denotes a lesser engagement in environmental sustainability compared to Benjamin. It is important, however, not to pass hasty judgement on Michael. His eco-consciousness shouldn't be valued solely on whether or not he composts. Other sustainable practices like water conservation, energy efficiency, recycling, or using renewable energy sources could just as much define his environmental commitment. But in the context of this particular storyline where composting is the primary lens through which we evaluate the characters' environmental focus, it would indeed appear that Michael lags behind Benjamin in eco-consciousness. In short, observing the characters' attitude toward composting suggests that Michael is less environmentally conscious compared to Benjamin. This simple habit underscores a broader perspective on their approach to environmental stewardship, marking Benjamin as the one propelling change through his composting efforts, painting a hopeful picture for a greener, cleaner planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — The United Nations secretary-general is launching an independent investigation into allegations that U.N. peacekeepers did not respond to prevent multiple cases of abuse and sexual violence against civilians and foreigners in South Sudan's capital.      Ban Ki-moon's spokesman said late Tuesday that the U.N. chief is alarmed by reports of the July 11 attack on a compound popular with foreigners in Juba. The Associated Press this week reported that South Sudanese troops went on a nearly four-hour rampage through the compound in one of the worst targeted attacks on aid workers in the country's three-year civil war.      Several witnesses told the AP that soldiers shot dead a local journalist while forcing the foreigners to watch, raped several foreign women, singled out Americans, beat and robbed people and carried out mock executions.      Separately, several witnesses also told the AP that U.N. peacekeepers in Juba did not stop the rapes of local women by soldiers outside the U.N.'s main camp last month.      The U.N. chief \\"urges, once more, the government of South Sudan to investigate these human right violations and to prosecute those involved in these unspeakable acts of violence,\\" his spokesman said in a statement.      South Sudan President Salva Kiir told lawmakers on Monday that his government is also investigating the attack at the compound.      Kiir also said the country's military was not \\"completely subordinate to the authority of a civilian government\\" and that the government \\"will show zero tolerance\\" toward sexual assault. ||||| FILE - In this Monday, July 11, 2016 file photo, a South Sudan soldier patrols the street in Juba, Souh Sudan.

(Associated Press)      NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The soldier pointed his AK-47 at the female aid worker and gave her a choice.      \\"Either you have sex with me, or we make every man here rape you and then we shoot you in the head,\\" she remembers him saying.      She didn't really have a choice. By the end of the evening, she had been raped by 15 South Sudanese soldiers.      On July 11, South Sudanese troops, fresh from winning a battle in the capital, Juba, over opposition forces, went on a nearly four-hour rampage through a residential compound popular with foreigners, in one of the worst targeted attacks on aid workers in South Sudan's three-year civil war. They shot dead a local journalist while forcing the foreigners to watch, raped several foreign women, singled out Americans, beat and robbed people and carried out mock executions, several witnesses told The Associated Press.      For hours throughout the assault, the U.N. peacekeeping force stationed less than a mile away refused to respond to desperate calls for help. Neither did embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.      The Associated Press interviewed by phone eight survivors, both male and female, including three who said they were raped. The other five said they were beaten; one was shot. Most insisted on anonymity for their safety or to protect their organizations still operating in South Sudan.      The accounts highlight, in raw detail, the failure of the U.N. peacekeeping force to uphold its core mandate of protecting civilians, notably those just a few minutes' drive away. The Associated Press previously reported that U.N. peacekeepers in Juba did not stop the rapes of local women by soldiers outside the U.N.'s main camp last month.      The attack on the Terrain hotel complex shows the hostility toward foreigners and aid workers by troops under the command of South Sudan's President Salva Kiir, who has been fighting supporters of rebel leader Riek Machar since civil war erupted in December 2013. Both sides have been accused of abuses. The U.N. recently passed a U.S.-sponsored resolution to send more peacekeeping troops to protect civilians.      Army spokesman Lul Ruai did not deny the attack at the Terrain but said it was premature to conclude the army was responsible. \\"Everyone is armed, and everyone has access to uniforms and we have people from other organized forces, but it was definitely done by people of South Sudan and by armed people of Juba,\\" he said.      A report on the incident compiled by the Terrain's owner at Ruai's request, seen by the AP, alleges the rapes of at least five women, torture, mock executions, beatings and looting. An unknown number of South Sudanese women were also assaulted.      The attack came just as people in Juba were thinking the worst was over.      Three days earlier, gunfire had erupted outside the presidential compound between armed supporters of the two sides in South Sudan's civil war, at the time pushed together under an uneasy peace deal. The violence quickly spread across the city.      Throughout the weekend, bullets whizzed through the Terrain compound, a sprawling complex with a pool, squash court and a bar patronized by expats and South Sudanese elites. It is also in the shadow of the U.N.'s largest camp in Juba.      By Monday, the government had nearly defeated the forces under Machar, who fled the city. As both sides prepared to call for a cease-fire, some residents of the Terrain started to relax.      \\"Monday was relatively chill,\\" one survivor said.      What was thought to be celebratory gunfire was heard. And then the soldiers arrived. A Terrain staffer from Uganda said he saw between 80 and 100 men pour into the compound after breaking open the gate with gunshots and tire irons. The Terrain's security guards were armed only with shotguns and were vastly outnumbered. The soldiers then went to door to door, taking money, phones, laptops and car keys.      \\"They were very excited, very drunk, under the influence of something, almost a mad state, walking around shooting off rounds inside the rooms,\\" one American said.      One man wore a blue police uniform, but the rest wore camouflage, the American said. Many had shoulder patches with the face of a tiger, the insignia worn by the president's personal guard.      For about an hour, soldiers beat the American with belts and the butts of their guns and accused him of hiding rebels. They fired bullets at his feet and close to his head. Eventually, one soldier who appeared to be in charge told him to leave the compound. Soldiers at the gate looked at his U.S. passport and handed it back, with instructions.      \\"You tell your embassy how we treated you,\\" they said. He made his way to the nearby U.N. compound and appealed for help.      Meanwhile, soldiers were breaking into a two-story apartment block in the Terrain which had been deemed a safe house because of a heavy metal door guarding the apartments upstairs. Warned by a Kenyan staffer, more than 20 people inside, most of them foreigners, tried to hide. About 10 squeezed into a single bathroom.      The building shook as soldiers shot at the metal door and pried metal bars off windows for more than an hour, said residents. Once inside, the soldiers started ransacking the rooms and assaulting people they found.      Some of the soldiers were violent as they sexually assaulted women, said the woman who said she was raped by 15 men. Others, who looked to be just 15 or 16 years old, looked scared and were coerced into the act.      \\"One in particular, he was calling you, 'Sweetie, we should run away and get married.' It was like he was on a first date,\\" the woman said. \\"He didn't see that what he was doing was a bad thing.\\"      After about an hour and a half, the soldiers broke into the bathroom. They shot through the door, said Jesse Bunch, an American contractor who was hit in the leg.      \\"We kill you! We kill you!\\" the soldiers shouted, according to a Western woman in the bathroom. \\"They would shoot up at the ceiling and say, 'Do you want to die?' and we had to answer 'No!'\\"      The soldiers then pulled people out one by one. One woman said she was sexually assaulted by multiple men. Another Western woman said soldiers beat her with fists and threatened her with their guns when she tried to resist. She said five men raped her.      During the attack on the Terrain, several survivors told the AP that soldiers specifically asked if they were American. \\"One of them, as soon as he said he was American, he was hit with a rifle butt,\\" said a woman.      When the soldiers came across John Gatluak, they knew he was local. The South Sudanese journalist worked for Internews, a media development organization funded by USAID. He had taken refuge at the Terrain after being briefly detained a few days earlier. The tribal scars on his forehead made it obvious he was Nuer, the same as opposition leader, Riek Machar.      Upon seeing him, the soldiers pushed him to the floor and beat him, according to the same woman who saw the American beaten.      Later in the attack, and after Kiir's side declared a ceasefire at 6 p.m., the soldiers forced the foreigners to stand in a semi-circle, said Gian Libot, a Philippines citizen who spent much of the attack under a bed until he was discovered.      One soldier ranted against foreigners. \\"He definitely had pronounced hatred against America,\\" Libot said, recalling the soldier's words: \\"You messed up this country. You're helping the rebels. The people in the U.N., they're helping the rebels.\\"      During the tirade, a soldier hit a man suspected of being American with a rifle butt. At one point, the soldier threatened to kill all the foreigners assembled. \\"We're gonna show the world an example,\\" Libot remembered him saying.      Then Gatluak was hauled in front of the group. One soldier shouted \\"Nuer,\\" and another soldier shot him twice in the head. He shot the dying Gatluak four more times while he lay on the ground.      \\"All it took was a declaration that he was different, and they shot him mercilessly,\\" Libot said.      The shooting seemed to be a turning point for those assembled outside, Libot said. Looting and threats continued, but beatings started to draw to a close. Other soldiers continued to assault men and women inside the apartment block.      From the start of the attack, those inside the Terrain compound sent messages pleading for help by text and Facebook messages and emails.      \\"All of us were contacting whoever we could contact. The U.N., the U.S. embassy, contacting the specific battalions in the U.N., contacting specific departments,\\" said the woman raped by 15 men.      A member of the U.N.'s Joint Operations Center in Juba first received word of the attack at 3:37 p.m., minutes after the breach of the compound, according to an internal timeline compiled by a member of the operations center and seen by AP.      Eight minutes later another message was sent to a different member of the operations center from a person inside Terrain saying that people were hiding there. At 4:22 p.m., that member received another message urging help.      Five minutes after that, the U.N. mission's Department of Safety and Security and its military command wing were alerted. At 4:33 p.m., a Quick Reaction Force, meant to intervene in emergencies, was informed. One minute later, the timeline notes the last contact on Monday from someone trapped inside Terrain.      For the next hour and a half the timeline is blank. At 6:52, shortly before sunset, the timeline states that \\"DSS would not send a team.\\"      About 20 minutes later, a Quick Reaction Force of Ethiopians from the multinational U.N. mission was tasked to intervene, coordinating with South Sudan's army chief of staff, Paul Malong, who was also sending soldiers. But the Ethiopian battalion stood down, according to the timeline. Malong's troops eventually abandoned their intervention too because it took too long for the Quick Reaction Force to act.      The American who was released early in the assault and made it to the U.N. base said he also alerted U.N. staff. At around dusk, a U.N. worker he knew requested three different battalions to send a Quick Reaction Force.      \\"Everyone refused to go. Ethiopia, China, and Nepal. All refused to go,\\" he said.      Eventually, South Sudanese security forces entered the Terrain and rescued all but three Western women and around 16 Terrain staff.      No one else was sent that night to find them. The U.N. timeline said a patrol would go in the morning, but this \\"was cancelled due to priority.\\" A private security firm rescued the three Western women the staffers the next morning.      \\"The peacekeepers did not venture out of the bases to protect civilians under imminent threat,\\" Human Rights Watch said Monday in a report on abuses throughout Juba.      Asked why U.N. peacekeepers didn't respond to repeated pleas for help, the U.N. said it is investigating.      \\"Obviously, we regret the loss of life and the violence that the people who were in Hotel Terrain endured, and we take this incident very seriously,\\" the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Farhan Haq, told reporters Monday. \\"As you're aware, we have called on the national authorities to investigate this incident thoroughly and to bring the perpetrators to justice.\\"      The U.S. Embassy, which also received requests for help during the attack, \\"was not in a position to intervene,\\" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters Monday. She said the U.S. ambassador instead contacted local government officials, and she noted that the Terrain area was controlled by South Sudanese government forces at the time.      Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said that \\"during the fighting throughout the city, the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan responded to distress calls from the compound and urgently contacted South Sudanese government officials, who sent a response force to the site to stop the attack.\\"      \\"We are deeply concerned that United Nations peacekeepers were apparently either incapable of or unwilling to respond to calls for help. We have requested and are awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the United Nations and demand swift corrective action in the event that these allegations are substantiated,\\" she said in a statement.      The assault at the Terrain pierced a feeling of security among some foreigners who had assumed that they would be protected by their governments or the hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers almost next door.      One of the women gang-raped said security advisers from an aid organization living in the compound told residents repeatedly that they were safe because foreigners would not be targeted. She said: \\"This sentence, 'We are not targeted,' I heard half an hour before they assaulted us.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The United Nations has launched an independent investigation into allegations that UN peacekeepers failed to protect South Sudanese civilians and foreigners during a targeted attack by South Sudanese troops on aid workers in the country’s capital, Juba, on 11 July.

Build a movie plot around this: What city does Puyi visit? the Forbidden City The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: The Last Emperor's Secret Genre: Historical Drama, Mystery Plot: In 20th-century China, Puyi (played by a renowned actor), the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, has grown tired of his mundane life in exile. He has heard whispers of an ancient secret buried deep within the Forbidden City, a secret so powerful that it could change the fate of China. Puyi decides to embark on a daring quest to uncover the truth, hoping to regain his lost glory and rewrite history. As the journey begins, Puyi forms a group of unlikely allies: a master thief known as Chen (played by a popular action star) who specializes in infiltrating heavily guarded places, a powerful and enigmatic sorceress named Lian (played by an A-list actress), and a loyal former palace guard Zhao (played by an upcoming actor) who still holds on to the hope of restoring the monarchy. The team of four embarks on an elaborate plan to sneak into the Forbidden City. They face various obstacles, from tense political adversaries and merciless assassins to treacherous secret passages. As they infiltrate the grounds and start exploring the ancient structures, they ultimately uncover a hidden chamber believed to contain the secret that Puyi seeks, which is revealed to be an ancient scroll, a blueprint for a lost technological marvel, known as the \\"Dragon's Breath.\\" As they decipher the blueprint, the team realizes that the Dragon's Breath is a weapon of unimaginable power, capable of tipping the scales in any conflict. Puyi wonders whether possessing the weapon could restore his family's lost empire, but the others question the wisdom of unearthing such a dangerous artifact. As they travel across the country to retracing the steps of the ancient scroll, they encounter numerous challenges and life-threatening situations that test their courage, loyalty, and morality. As Puyi grapples with his desire for power and his newfound friendships, the team discovers the true nature of the Dragon's Breath and its dreadful consequences. In the film's climactic final act, Puyi abandons his ambition, understanding that many lives would be lost if the Dragon's Breath were to be found. He makes peace with his past and chooses to leave behind the secrets of the Forbidden City, using the wisdom of his ancestors to protect and serve his people from the shadows. The movie ends with Puyi reconciling with his former enemies and establishing a new, peaceful life away from politics, having learned the value of brotherhood and self-sacrifice. The Last Emperor's Secret becomes a critically acclaimed historical drama, perfectly blending action, intrigue, and emotional storytelling, making it a must-watch for audiences across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Blind Dating Context: Danny Valdessecchi (Chris Pine) is an intelligent, handsome, charming boy who happens to be blind. Having been blind from birth, he volunteers for a risky experimental visual prosthesis that may restore his sightâhaving a microchip installed in the visual cortex of his brain that connects to a camera that would give him only, at best, fuzzy black and white images. During the tests he meets a beautiful Indian nurse, Leeza (Anjali Jay). Meanwhile, because Danny is a virgin at 22, his brother Larry (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who runs a limousine service, gets him a string of hilariously disastrous blind dates in between rentals. When Danny finally realizes that he is falling for Leeza, she tells him she cannot see him anymore because she has been promised in an arranged marriage. Believing that Leeza did not pursue their relationship because of his being blind, Danny becomes depressed and stops taking the necessary tests for his brain surgery. Danny's family, his eccentric psychotherapist Dr. Evans (Jane Seymour) and eye doctor Dr. Perkins (Stephen Tobolowsky) advise him to continue because it is his only chance of seeing, and soon Danny is successfully operated on. He sees his family's faces for the first time, but not Leeza's, who was away, reluctantly preparing for her marriage. Soon the experiment proves to be a failure, as the fragile prosthesis in his brain moves, clouding his already weak vision, and Danny goes back to being blind. Realizing that he really loves Leeza, he bursts into the wedding, professing his love for her and saying \\"Love is how you speak to me. Love is how you touch me...and guide me showing me the way to go. And when we kiss, when we kiss, it moves me to my soul.\\" The couple kiss.

Is Versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the Wii Menu prevented copying exploited save files onto the console until circumvention methods were discovered, and version 4.0 of the Wii Menu patched the vulnerability. a good answer to this question? Choices: (1). yes (2). no","output":"(1). Yes The provided answer accurately describes the Wii Menu versions that prevented copying exploited save files. To provide a more detailed response: The Wii Menu is the main interface for Nintendo's Wii console, used to manage games, channels, and settings. It is organized as a series of channels, where each channel represents an application, game, or utility. Along with the ability to manage save data, the Wii Menu also enforces the console's security features and prevents unauthorized modifications. Exploited save files are essentially game saves that have been modified to include a vulnerability or exploit that can be used to \\"soft-mod\\" the console, allowing for the execution of unofficial software. Some examples of these modified game saves include Bannerbomb, Indiana Pwns, and Twilight Hack which are known to exploit a vulnerability in the Wii's system software. Version 3.3 of the Wii Menu was released in June 2008 and attempted to limit the copying of exploited save files onto the console. This version came with increased save file integrity checks and blocked specific save files known to contain exploits, such as the Twilight Hack. However, it wasn't very effective in stopping determined users, as new exploits were quickly discovered. Version 3.4, which was released in late November 2008, included even tighter restrictions on save file copying and further refined the measures to block exploited save files. It was more effective than the previous update, but it was still possible for users to find ways to bypass these security measures. Finally, version 4.0 of the Wii Menu, released in March 2009, effectively patched the vulnerabilities that had been exploited in previous versions. It included a stronger save data check and prevented the use of well-known exploits at the time. However, this version also introduced new features such as the System Menu IOS, which inadvertently led to new methods for exploiting the console. In summary, versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the Wii Menu introduced measures to prevent copying exploited save files onto the console, while version 4.0 aimed to fully patch the vulnerability. Despite these efforts, determined users were able to find new ways to bypass these security measures, which led to an ongoing battle between console security and users seeking to \\"soft-mod\\" their Wii consoles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Secret protocols in the new agreement modified the \\"Secret Additional Protocols\\" of the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, ceding the Lithuanian Strip to the Soviet Union in exchange for 7.5 million dollars (31.5 million Reichsmark). The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka river and the Baltic Sea. It also extended trade regulation of the 1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic States now occupied by the Soviets and other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within two and a half months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories, and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and \\"White Russian\\" \\"nationals\\" in German-held territories. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How long did the amendment reject the trade agreements?","output":"The amendment in the agreement signed on 10 January 1941 did not reject the trade agreements; instead, it extended the trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942. This means that the trade agreements between Germany and the Soviet Union continued for an additional period of approximately one year and seven months from the date of the new agreement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island had more small-beaked birds die? A:","output":"A: Bank island had more small-beaked birds die.  In the background article, it is mentioned that during a drought, fewer seeds are available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks can only crack open and eat smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks can crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died during the drought. In your new situation, Bank island is experiencing a severe drought, which means a decline in available seeds.

William II (Old Norman: Williame; c. 1056 - 2 August 1100), the third son of William the Conqueror, was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life. William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma, or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the Curia Regis, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated.  In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm III's brother Donald seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar AEtheling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.  William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.  In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks--a sum equalling about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.  As regent for his brother Robert in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade Aquitaine at the time of his death. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do this for","output":"William Rufus, also known as William II, undertook various actions and campaigns during his reign. One particular action mentioned in the passage was raising a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England.

In return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equaled about a quarter of William's annual revenue, Robert pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William.

Q:I can use this background: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.  Now, I have a new situation: Alexiev and Sabrina were enthusiastic chemistry students completing the first experiment of their new course. They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures. Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture.  Answer this question please: Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? A:","output":"Sabrina's mixture has a higher pH value at the end of the experiment. Based on the background information provided, a solution with a higher concentration of hydronium ions has a pH lower than 7 and is considered acidic. In contrast, a lower concentration of hydronium ions represents a less acidic or more alkaline solution. Since Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present in his mixture, his solution would have a lower pH value and would be more acidic. On the other hand, Sabrina's mixture had a low concentration of hydronium ions, which means her solution would be less acidic and have a higher pH value.  Recall that the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (pure water). Solutions with pH values lower than 7 are considered acidic, while solutions with pH values higher than 7 are considered alkaline or basic. In their chemistry experiment, the students started with pure water (pH 7) and subjected it to different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. Alexiev's water became more acidic, thus decreasing its pH value, while Sabrina's water either remained neutral or became less acidic, thus resulting in a higher pH value in comparison to Alexiev's mixture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stomp to launch.","output":"Title: Stomp Rockets: A Fun and Educational DIY Project for Kids and Adults Alike Introduction Who says learning about science can't be a fun and exciting adventure? With just a few simple materials and a little creativity, you can create your own stomp rocket launcher that teaches about the principles of physics while providing hours of entertainment for children and adults alike. In this article, we will discuss the mechanics behind stomp rockets, the materials needed to create your own rocket launcher, and how to successfully launch your rocket with a powerful stomp. What are Stomp Rockets and How Do They Work? A stomp rocket is a toy that uses air pressure to propel itself into the air. The basic idea behind a stomp rocket is to have a small rocket that can be launched by applying force, typically with a simple stomp of the foot, onto an air chamber connected to a launching tube. The force applied by the stomp compresses the air in the chamber, and the compressed air is forced through the launching tube, propelling the rocket into the sky. The fundamentals of stomp rocket science are rooted in the principles of physics, specifically Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of the stomp rocket launcher, the action is the force applied by your foot, while the reaction is the rocket's propulsion into the air. Materials Needed to Build a Stomp Rocket Launcher To create your own stomp rocket launcher, you'll need the following materials: 1. A 1-liter plastic bottle (such as a soda bottle) 2. A length of PVC pipe (about ½ inch diameter, approximately 2 feet long) 3. A foam rocket (available at most toy stores, or you can create your own using foam balls and paper) 4. Duct tape or electrical tape Assembly Instructions 1. First, attach the PVC pipe to the opening of the 1-liter bottle using duct tape or electrical tape. Ensure that the pipe is held securely in place by wrapping the tape around both the pipe and the neck of the bottle several times. The pipe should be securely fastened so that it is air-tight. 2. Next, slide your foam rocket onto the top end of the PVC pipe. Make sure that the rocket is not too tight or too loose, as this will impact the launch's success. If you are using a store-bought rocket, it should fit snuggly onto the pipe. For a homemade rocket, you may need to adjust the size of the hole in the foam ball to fit the pipe correctly. Preparing for Launch Now that your stomp rocket launcher is complete, you're ready for take-off! Follow these steps for a successful launch: 1. Find a suitable launch location with ample space. An open field or a large, unobstructed backyard are ideal spots. 2. Place the launcher on the ground, with the bottle flat on the ground and the connected PVC pipe angling upwards to your desired launch angle. 3. Make sure the surrounding area is clear of any obstacles or people who may be injured by the rocket's trajectory. 4. When you're ready to launch, take a strong step or stomp onto the 1-liter bottle with your foot. The force from your stomp will compress the air inside the bottle, and the compressed air will propel the rocket off the PVC pipe and into the air. 5. Retrieve your rocket, reset the launcher, and prepare for another exciting launch! Conclusion Stomp rockets are not only a fun and enjoyable activity for people of all ages, but they also demonstrate fundamental scientific principles in action. By building your own stomp rocket launcher and experiencing the thrill of launching the rockets, children and adults can gain an appreciation for the science behind the fun. So gather your materials, assemble your launcher, and start stomping your way to the skies with this educational and exhilarating DIY project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: How did Benjamin Franklin's anonymous letter in 1784 propose to conserve candles and take advantage of natural sunlight in Paris? Explain the suggested measures and discuss how the context of timekeeping in 18th-century Europe differed from the standardized times that emerged later on due to advances in rail and communication networks. Answer: In 1784, Benjamin Franklin, an American envoy to France, anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians could economize on their consumption of candles by rising earlier to make use of morning sunlight. This was consistent with his famous adage, \\"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\\" In his satirical letter, Franklin proposed several measures aimed at encouraging people to wake up earlier and make use of natural light. These included taxing shutters, rationing candles, ringing church bells, and firing cannons at sunrise. However, it is essential to note that Franklin did not suggest the implementation of Daylight Saving Time (DST) at that time, as many people commonly believe. In the context of 18th-century Europe, precise schedules and standardized times were not prevalent, unlike today's world, where timekeeping depends on synchronization across geographical and communication networks. Advances in rail and communication systems later forced the need for standardization in timekeeping, marking a notable departure from the relatively imprecise timekeeping that characterized Franklin's era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \\"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...  Guess a valid title for it!

Question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Renee goes along and Webster calls her \\"Freckle Face,\\" which irritates her. Judge Gannon asks him who he shot. Webster explains it was two men who took it upon themselves to combine his herd with theirs. The judge agrees that was justified, so he dismisses the case, but he also tells Webster his cows are being confiscated for disturbance of the peace, among other things. Webster wants to take issue with that, but he realizes he's badly outnumbered, and justice usually goes to the strongest at the time.The owner of the saloon, a woman named Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), asks the judge why he confiscated Webster's cattle. \\"Because I wanted them,\\" he says.Webster and Tatum decide to make for the Klondike, even though they lost their cattle, and begin making preparations.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Statistically, you are more likely to hit a ship if you aim for the center of the board, so start there. The four by four squares in the middle of the board are likely to contain a carrier ship or battleship. Imagine the board as a checkerboard, where half the squares are dark and half are light. Each ship covers at least two squares, meaning every ship must touch a dark square. Therefore, if you fire randomly at only even squares or only odd squares, you will minimize the number of turns you need to hit every ship.  Once you have a hit, you will cease firing randomly and commence targeting the ship in question. To keep track of the light and dark squares, look at your own board and imagine that the diagonal line of squares from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is dark. Imagine the squares from the to right corner to the bottom left corner are light. You can count out from there to ensure each square you're targeting is the right color. If you strike out twice when firing, try firing into a different segment of the board. The chances that you just missed a ship are lower than the chances that you missed by a wide margin.","output":"In order to maximize your chances of hitting a ship in the game of Battleship, there are a few strategic methods you can employ. First and foremost, focusing your efforts on the center of the board is statistically the most effective approach, as the 4x4 central squares are more likely to contain larger ships such as the carrier and battleship. To further optimize your strategy, you can visualize the board as a checkerboard with an alternating pattern of dark and light squares. Because every ship occupies at least two squares, it's guaranteed that each ship will be in contact with at least one dark square. By only firing at even or odd squares, you can significantly reduce the number of turns needed to hit all ships on the board. Once you've successfully hit a ship, shift your approach from random firing to targeted firing, aiming to hit and subsequently sink the discovered ship. To help visualize the light and dark squares, mentally draw diagonal lines from the top left to bottom right corner and from the top right to bottom left corner of your own game board. By counting outward from these lines, you can easily determine which squares to target with your shots. However, if you happen to miss the target twice in a row, it's advisable to switch to a different segment of the board. The probability of narrowly missing a ship is fairly low, so it's more likely that you missed by a larger margin. By focusing on another area, you increase your chances of finding and hitting an opponent's ship. In summary, begin by targeting the center of the board, then use the checkerboard logic to maximize efficiency, and adjust your strategy once you've hit a ship. If you're frequently missing your shots, switch to a different area of the board and keep employing these strategic techniques to increase your chances of winning the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The primary characters are the rodents contained within the cage and box. Step 2: Description of the cage and box The cage was larger and more spacious, which allowed the rodents to move around freely and comfortably. It had ample space for them to play, explore, and rest. The cage was equipped with water bottles, food dispensers, and some toys for the rodents to interact with. In contrast, the box was smaller and more cramped. It limited the rodents' movement and did not provide much room for them to roam or play. The box had minimal amenities, like a small water dish and a limited supply of food. Step 3: Rodents' preference for the cage The rodents naturally preferred the cage due to its spaciousness and amenities.

The Dutchman is experienced enough to know that victories like the one over Liverpool in the final in Miami might score a few points with the supporters but are worth very little else. There are far bigger tests to come. However, the manager he defeated at the Sun Life Stadium believes the new United boss might still be in for a rude awakening when the new Premier League season starts a week on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training. Looking good: Wayne Rooney scored in the win over Liverpool in Miami. Brendan Rodgers warned that Van Gaal will not have experienced the type of intense competition inherent to English football during his spells in charge at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax, in countries where one or two clubs routinely dominate. Van Gaal has won titles at all three clubs in Spain, Germany and Holland. But Rodgers believes he will have a battle on his hands to add the Premier League to that list. ‘I think he’ll find the competition in this league will be different to any other league that he’s worked in,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘In a lot of the other leagues, there are one or two teams and those are the teams that are expected to win. Silver lining: Darren Fletcher and Rooney celebrate with the Guinness International Champions Cup. Ajax (Sept, 1991) The Dutch powerhouses had won only one of the previous six league titles but Van Gaal, in his first managerial post, went on to win a hat-trick of titles, a Champions League trophy and a UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona (July, 1997) Taking over from Bobby Robson, Van Gaal won two back-to-back league titles and a Copa del Rey. AZ Alkmaar (July, 2005) Alkmaar had established a reputation as a solid, mid-table club. Van Gaal mounted a title challenge in his first season and after an 11th-placed blip in 2007-08, won their first title in 28 years. ‘This is a league where the top team plays the bottom team and on any given day you can lose. ‘I think the competition will probably take him by (surprise), and that’s from foreign managers I have spoken to over the years. 'I’ve worked closely with foreign players, and that real physical competitive nature will be different to anywhere else he’s worked before.’ Liverpool certainly did their best to emphasise the point in Miami. Steven Gerrard put them ahead from the penalty spot and last season’s runners-up could have been more goals to the good before United hit back to win 3-1 with second-half strikes from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard. It means Van Gaal won all five games on tour, albeit beating Inter Milan on penalties. When Rodgers’ comments were put to the United boss, he responded with the smile of a man who knows what to expect. All together: Juan Mata is mobbed by his teammates after his goal. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements. Touching down: Louis van Gaal arrives back in Manchester after winning in America. ‘That’s why I’m here,’ said Van Gaal. ‘OK maybe he is right because I have to experience that, but I was also in Spain and in my first year I won three titles. In Germany I won two titles. If I win one here, we will all be happy.’ Asked the value of winning the tournament, he replied: ‘Nothing. It’s nice for the fans in the USA — also at home — that we beat Liverpool. It’s not our favourite opponent, I think, for Man United fans. We’ve given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that’s very important. ‘Of course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose. But the most important game is Swansea at home in the first game, that’s the one we have to win.’ As well as managing two top clubs in close proximity to one another, Van Gaal and Rodgers also work under American owners. Although the Northern Irishman spoke of his respect for his new rival and his belief that United will be title challengers again this season, he still believes Van Gaal’s predecessor David Moyes was let down by the Glazers during his ill-fated season in charge at Old Trafford. ‘I think there were a lot of things at Manchester United that were not seen by many,’ said Rodgers. ‘David had to go in and where I felt for him is that he thought he was getting time. He signed a long-term deal and thought he had that longevity. It just shows you. You have to win games and hopefully then you get the chance. That’s where I’m very fortunate here. I’ve got brilliant owners. I’ve been clear in terms of how I’ve wanted to work and I’ve been able to work.’ Warning: Brendan Rodgers says Louis van Gaal will find managing Manchester United tough. Asked if United can emulate Liverpool by recovering from a seventh-place finish to challenge for the title again, Rodgers said: ‘I think it will be a totally different mindset. Domestically, for the last 20 years they’ve been champions 13 times. So they already have something in place. When I came to Liverpool, we were eighth at the time and the club was nearly going out of business, so it’s totally different. ‘The United players will be disappointed with where they finished last year, of course. With the quality they have, they will want to push on.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article are as follows: 1. Manchester United won the Guinness International Cup after defeating Liverpool in the final in Miami. 2. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers warned that Louis van Gaal, the new Manchester United manager, might face a rude awakening when the new Premier League season starts due to the intense competition inherent to English football. 3. Rodgers believes that Van Gaal's experience in managing teams in Spain, Germany, and Holland might not be enough to prepare him for the challenges of the Premier League. 4. Van Gaal countered Rodgers' comments by mentioning his successful track record in his first seasons in Spain and Germany, and expressed his desire to win a title in England. 5. Rodgers also mentioned his belief that Van Gaal's predecessor, David Moyes, was let down by Manchester United's owners and did not receive adequate time to prove himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dad, Dude, I rocked them out!!! says our son Review: This toy was an excellent buy. It took only about 1 hour to put it together, and our son was enjoying it. It's been a joy to watch him enjoying his new track. The only downfall to it is that it comes with only 2 cars, and none of his other hot wheels we have will work--they're all too heavy to zip around the track. Other than that, this toy is great! Answer:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that they are mostly satisfied with the product. The title, \\"Dad, Dude, I rocked them out!!! says our son,\\" implies that their son was excited and happy with the toy, which contributes to the overall satisfaction. The customer also mentions that the toy was an \\"excellent buy\\" and that it was enjoyable to watch their son play with the new track, further reinforcing the notion of satisfaction. However, there is one aspect of the product that the customer is not completely happy with, which is the limitation of only being able to use two included cars on the track, as their other Hot Wheels cars are too heavy. Despite this minor issue, the overall tone of the review and the customer's experience with the product suggests that they are largely satisfied with their purchase, considering the toy \\"great.\\" So, taking the whole review into account, the customer is predominantly satisfied."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Q: Context: Classical strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Typhimurium) predominantly cause a self-limiting diarrheal illness in humans and a systemic disease in mice. In this study, we report the characterization of a strain isolated from a blood-culture taken from a 15-year old woman suffering from invasive severe salmonellosis, refractory to conventional therapy with extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC).', 'The strain, named 33676, was characterized as multidrug-resistant Salmonella serogroup A by biochemical, antimicrobial and serological tests. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and XbaI macrorestrictions (PFGE) showed that strain 33676 belonged to the Typhimurium ST213 genotype, previously described for other Mexican Typhimurium strains. PCR analyses revealed the presence of IncA/C, IncFIIA and ColE1-like plasmids and the absence of the Salmonella virulence plasmid (pSTV). Conjugation assays showed that the ESC-resistance gene bla CMY-2 was carried on the conjugative IncF plasmid, instead of the IncA/C plasmid, as found in previously studied ST213 strains. Although the IncA/C plasmid conferred most of the observed antimicrobial resistances it was not self-conjugative; it was rather able to conjugate by co-integrating with the IncF plasmid. Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections. Both type-three secretion system (T3SS), encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2), were functional in the 33676 strain and, interestingly, this strain produced the H2 FljB flagellin instead of the H1 FliC flagellin commonly expressed by S. enterica strains.Question: Is a multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium ST213 human-invasive strain ( 33676 ) containing the bla CMY-2 gene on an IncF plasmid attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice? A:","output":"Part #1: Generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Usage: \\"Is a multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium ST213 human-invasive strain (33676) containing the bla CMY-2 gene on an IncF plasmid attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice?\\" Sample response: Yes, strain 33676 is attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice. This meets the criteria because the context directly states that \\"Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections.\\" Part #2: Use the context to support the generated answer. Usage: Context: \\"Strain 33676 was fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections.\\" Sample response: The context reveals that strain 33676 was studied and found to be fully attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice infections, indicating that the strain is not as harmful in mice as it is in humans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who does Candy return to? Movie plot title: Candy Movie plot: Candy (Abbie Cornish) is a beautiful young lady with a lot of potential who falls in love with a charming, young, aspiring poet (Heath Ledger) and his beatnik lifestyle- which includes drugs. Before too long, both of them are wrapped up in the druggie lifestyle. What starts off as harmless fun and pleasure ends up as pain and misery. Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal. This is ultimately a very sad story with a bittersweet ending. Dan's devotion to Candy is shown when the two suffer through horrible heroin withdrawal only to decide that they cannot quit the drug cold turkey and turn to methadone. Dan moves them to the country and takes on some menial labor jobs for money to put food on the table. Candy doesn't work and soon becomes more and more depressed and lonely; hanging out and smoking pot with a neighbor. Her behavior becomes more and more erratic and before long she flees the country. It's a heartbreaking scene, when Dan comes home from a hard day of work to find the place trashed and Candy gone, words written in lipstick on the walls. He falls apart. He's despondent and turns back to drugs. He goes to see his mentor and father figure, Casper (Geoffrey Rush), who has developed a drug more potent and cheaper than heroin; but when he arrives there he finds his friend has overdosed. This is a powerful moment in the film and this is where Ledger is at his best, quietly conveying his complete emotional devastation. He's lost the girl he loves and his best friend. He's hit rock bottom. He gets a dishwashing job and manages to stay clean; still thinking about Candy and still writing his poetry on breaks. Eventually the day comes when a...

Article: If you ask someone why he or she wears clothes, the answer will probably be \\"to keep warm and to cover my body\\". These are the basic reasons why clothes are worn, but people also want to look attractive and appear successful to others.     If people only wore clothes for warmth and to cover their bodies, most clothes would be simple and cheap. In most Western countries, however, clothes are sometimes very expensive. The main reason for this is not the cost of the cloth or the cost of making the clothes. The clothes are expensive because of fashion .     Successful businessmen, for example, often wear very expensive suits, shirts and ties. Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars for a suit and hundreds of dollars for a tie. It's just a suit and a tie but they pay these prices because of the famous name of the designer. A suit costing much less would be just as warm and would cover the wearer's body just as well.     Fashion is always changing, which means those who want to be fashionable have to buy new clothes every few months, even if last month's clothes have only been worn once or twice. Some people have wardrobes full of clothes that have hardly been worn but are no longer in fashion. Being fashionable, therefore, can be a very expensive pastime !

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:You are given a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  and a hint : During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.  Please answer this question : Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? A:","output":"Considering the information provided, Jennifer would likely see more red sunsets in Malarn as compared to Trainlan. Since Malarn gets a large amount of dust in the air from the desert located across the ocean, it shares similarities with areas affected by the Sahara dust, such as Florida and the Caribbean. During mid-summer, these areas experience an increase in dust transport, leading to rainfall suppression and a change in the sky's appearance from blue to white. This, in turn, results in an increase in red sunsets. The presence of airborne dust particulates in Malarn negatively impacts air quality, but these dust events create conditions that are conducive to the increased frequency of red sunsets. On the other hand, no specific information about the dust situation or sunsets in Trainlan is provided. Nevertheless, as Trainlan is not mentioned to have similar high dust conditions, it can be inferred that it may have fewer red sunsets as compared to Malarn. In conclusion, Jennifer is likely to see more red sunsets in Malarn due to the high concentration of dust in the air, whereas in Trainlan, dust conditions are not specified, and hence, the frequency of red sunsets there would likely be lesser as compared to Malarn. It is important to note, however, that other factors such as personal preferences, lifestyle, and seasonal changes may also influence Jennifer's overall experience of sunsets in each city."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Information:  - The Rio Grande (or  or simply Río Bravo) is one of the principal rivers in the southwest United States and northern Mexico (the other being the Colorado River). The Rio Grande begins in south-central Colorado in the United States and flows to the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way, it forms part of the MexicoUnited States border. According to the International Boundary and Water Commission, its total length was in the late 1980s, though course shifts occasionally result in length changes. Depending on how it is measured, the Rio Grande is the fourth- or fifth-longest river system in North America.  - The Municipality of Nuevo Laredo is located in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas . Its municipal seat is Nuevo Laredo . The municipality contains more than 60 localities which the most important ones are Nuevo Laredo , El Campanario y Oradel , and Álvarez , the last two being suburbs of the city of Nuevo Laredo . By population , the municipality is the third largest in the state of Tamaulipas ( behind Reynosa and Matamoros respectively ) . The Nuevo Laredo municipality is the northernmost in Tamaulipas , lying at the extreme northwestern tip of its narrow strip of land along the Río Grande . The city of Nuevo Laredo contains approximately 97.5 % of the total population of the municipality .  - Mexico City, officially City of Mexico (, ; abbreviated as \\"CDMX\\"), is the capital and most populous city of the United Mexican States. As an \\"alpha\\" global city, Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in the Americas. It is located in the Valley of Mexico (\\"Valle de México\\"), a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of . The city consists of sixteen municipalities (previously called boroughs).  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.  - Laredo is the county seat of Webb County, Texas, United States, located on the north bank of the Rio Grande in South Texas, across from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico.

Information:  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Introducing The Beau Brummels is the debut album by American pop rock band the Beau Brummels. It was produced by Sly Stone, lead singer of Sly & the Family Stone. Unlike with most other debut albums of the era, ten of the twelve songs on this album are originals. The album peaked at number 24 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" 200 albums chart in 1965.  - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion.  - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution.  - Sal Valentino (born Salvatore Willard Spampinato, September 8, 1942) is an American rock musician, singer and songwriter, best known as lead singer of The Beau Brummels, subsequently becoming a songwriter as well. The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little.\\" He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, \\"Every Now and Then\\", in 2008.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - \`\` Just a Little '' is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels . The song is included on the band 's debut album , Introducing the Beau Brummels , and was released as its second single , following \`\` Laugh , Laugh '' . \`\` Just a Little '' became the band 's highest - charting U.S. single , peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1965 . It also reached the top 10 of the charts in Canada and Australia . Written by guitarist Ron Elliott with frequent collaborator Bob Durand , the song was produced by Sylvester Stewart , later known as Sly Stone . A live version of the song recorded during a 1974 concert was released on the band 's 2000 Live ! album . \`\` Just a Little '' has been covered by such artists as The Young Rascals , Them , Nils Lofgren , The Smithereens , and Frank Black .  - Beat music, British beat, or Merseybeat (after bands from Liverpool and nearby areas beside the River Mersey) is a pop and rock music genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll (mainly Chuck Berry guitar style and the midtempo beat of artists like Buddy Holly), doo-wop, skiffle and R&B. The genre provided many of the bands responsible for the British Invasion of the American pop charts starting in 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, including the format of the rock group around lead, rhythm and bass guitars with drums.  - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels, written by guitarist Ron Elliott and produced by Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone. Released in December 1964 as the band's debut single, the song reached number 15 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart the following February. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was the first hit single to come out of the emerging San Francisco music scene in response to the British Invasion.  The song was later included on the band's first full-length album, \\"Introducing the Beau Brummels\\", released in April 1965.   - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - Autumn Records was a 1960s San Francisco-based pop record label. Among the notable acts on its roster was The Beau Brummels, a band who released a pair of top 20 singles, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little\\".  - The Beau Brummels were an American rock band. Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewartlater known as Sly Stoneproduced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to the Beatles, while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.

A concert organised by the entrepreneur Richard Branson, it set an attendance record with 150,000 people confirmed in the audience. On 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London's early evening Today programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, EMI labelmate the Sex Pistols, give their seminal interview.

Given the question: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","output":"Test C would see lower concentration of the reactants than Test D. This is because, in Test C, the forward reaction is favored, causing the concentration of products to increase and the concentration of reactants to decrease. In Test D, the reverse reaction is favored, leading to the concentration of products decreasing and the concentration of reactants increasing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born Again the Limerick:  If a man could come back from the dead  And live in a little girl's head  Revenge he would get  For the murder he met By the guy that's now in his wife's bed. For me Born Again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy. Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. And was was with the telekinesis? Other than adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it.

As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullam leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancÃ©e Ingrid.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Dear Mr. Wolfson, The purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated   community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator  . I have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble   person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it. I thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor   an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event! I urge you to correct that omission   now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community. Sincerely, Linda Sullivan Question: What can we learn about Mr.Wolfson from the letter? Options: A: He knows Linda quite well. B: He is a careless person. C: He tries something to reward those who have done much community service. D: He tries his best to find Elizabeth and do something to reward her.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information.

What is the best way to stop feeling wrong about being a single girl who is successful but yearns for a good relationship? It is important to understand that there is nothing wrong with being a single and successful woman who wants a fulfilling relationship. Society may sometimes pressure people to conform to certain expectations regarding relationships and success, but you are allowed to define happiness and satisfaction for yourself. Here are some suggestions for embracing your current status and overcoming any feelings of inadequacy: a. Recognize your accomplishments: Acknowledge your professional achievements and personal growth. This will help boost your self-esteem and remind you that you have worked hard to reach where you are today. b. Develop a supportive social circle: Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who understand and support your values and aspirations. They can be your anchors during times of self-doubt and remind you of your worth. c. Enjoy your independence: Being single offers opportunities to explore hobbies, passions, and interests on your own terms. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, and develop a deeper relationship with yourself in the process. d. Embrace the journey: Yearning for a good relationship is natural, but remember not to view it as the ultimate end goal. Focus on your emotional well-being and personal fulfilment, irrespective of your relationship status. Trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. e. Seek professional help if necessary: If feelings of inadequacy persist, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor. They can offer guidance and support in dealing with any emotional obstacles you might be facing. 2. Do you think it's advisable to do a chartered A/C if you have nothing else to do (knowing you won't find it interesting at all)? It's essential to remember that career choices significantly impact your overall well-being and satisfaction in life. Choosing a profession solely because you have nothing else to do is not advisable, especially if you have no interest in it. Here are some things to keep in mind while weighing your options: a. Identify your interests and strengths: Reflect on the subjects and tasks that have truly captured your interest in the past and align them with your natural skills. This will help you find a field that you are truly passionate about. b. Research different industries and career paths: Explore various fields and professions, and try to find a career that suits both your interests and your values. Networking, mentorships, internships, or informational interviews can provide invaluable insights. c. Invest in education and skills development: Pursuing further education, vocational training, or professional certifications in your field of interest will help you gain the necessary knowledge and expertise for your desired profession. d. Be open to change and growth: Be prepared to adapt to new opportunities and challenges in your professional journey. Every experience contributes to your personal and professional development. In conclusion, it is crucial to value your personal and professional happiness, and you deserve to feel good about your achievements and your desires. As you navigate these decisions, always prioritize your well-being, personal growth, and long-term satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which solution would resist changes in pH, solution A or solution B?  Hint: If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0. This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH.

Write your fortunes: Using a pen, pencil, or fine-tipped marker, write personalized fortunes on each strip of paper. Consider adding humor, advice, or well-wishes to make each fortune unique and enjoyable for the recipient. 2. Prepare the fruit roll-ups: Unroll each fruit roll-up and carefully separate it from the backing. Depending on the size of your fruit roll-ups, you may need to cut or trim them into appropriately sized squares or circles, approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. 3. Position the fortunes: Place a paper fortune in the center of each fruit roll-up square or circle, ensuring that the fortune is horizontal and parallel to the edges of the fruit roll-up. 4. Fold the fruit roll-up: Carefully fold the fruit roll-up in half, enclosing the fortune inside. Press gently along the edge to seal the fruit roll-up, taking care not to tear the roll-up or the paper fortune inside. 5. Shape the fortune cookie: To create the classic fortune cookie shape, use your fingers to curve the folded edge of the fruit roll-up slightly upward while pressing the creased edge downward at the center. You can use a small, clean object (such as an egg carton or the rim of a measuring cup) to help hold the curved shape as the fruit roll-up sets. 6. Allow the fruit roll-up fortune cookies to set: It may be helpful to refrigerate the fortune cookies for a short period of time to help them maintain their shape. Place them on a plate or tray lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Keep fortune cookies in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes or until they are firm enough to hold their shape. 7. Serve and enjoy: Once the fruit roll-up fortune cookies have set, they are ready to be served. Arrange them on a plate or in a decorative box, perfect for sharing with friends and family. As each person unfolds their fruit roll-up fortune cookie, they will reveal the wise (or witty) words you've written on their paper fortune. 8. Store remaining fruit roll-up fortune cookies: If you have any leftover fortune cookies, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to keep them fresh. It is best to consume the fruit roll-up fortune cookies within a week for optimal freshness and flavor. Now you have successfully made fruit roll-up fortune cookies with personalized messages inside.

Q: An anharmonic oscillator exploiting this effect as a microelectromechanical system component was proposed by Serry, Walliser, and Maclay. Julian Schwinger has postulated that sonoluminescence arises due to this effect, and this effect requires that bag radius and mass are independent under a combination of the Skyrmion and MIT models, the chiral bag model of the nucleon. One setup for measuring it attached a polystyrene sphere to an atomic force microscope, and Lamoreaux used a torsional pendulum to achieve the first precise measurements of this effect. This force may produce pressures as large as an atmosphere at a separation of ten nanometers. For 10 points, name this effect arising from zero-point energy, described by the attraction or repulsion due to virtual photons between two close uncharged metallic sheets in a vacuum.

Question: This article: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on... contains an answer for the question: What is the real name of the person who honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers?, what is it ?

Age of the man: The original statement says \\"a man,\\" but it does not mention the age of the man. The age of the man is specified as \\"older\\" in the conclusion statement, which could not be derived from the given information. Therefore, it is unclear whether the man is older or younger, which adds ambiguity. 2. Counter vs. stand: The two statements use a different description for the place where the man is standing. The original statement says the man is standing next to a \\"stand,\\" whereas the conclusion talks about a \\"counter.\\" Even if both terms potentially refer to a surface or a piece of furniture (such as a display stand or a store counter), their meanings might not be interchangeable. 3. Lack of explicit information: Although there's a possibility that the given statement might refer to an older man standing next to a counter, this information is not explicitly mentioned.

Donald Trump Tries to Hit the Reset Button on a Bad Week Donald Trump took to the lectern with his family in his opulent Trump National Golf Club Westchester as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared from the speakers. But the candidate was notably chastened. “I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down,” Trump said. “I will make you proud of our party and our movement.” He spoke before a crowd of club members and a crush of television cameras on the night of the final GOP primary, subdued in the face of the harshest week of press coverage of his yearlong political career. With national Republicans feeling buyer’s remorse and threatening to abandon his nascent candidacy, Trump was under pressure to assuage the concerns of his party. The unconventional presumptive GOP nominee delivered a most conventional stump speech to prove he was up to the task of taking on newly crowned presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down,” Trump said. “I will make you proud of our party and our movement.” Audience members seemed surprised by Trump’s subdued tone, attempting to interrupt him with call-and-response and cheers as is common at his rallies, but Trump largely brushed them off as he tried to maintain a sober image for the cameras. It is hardly Trump’s first pivot to attempting to appear more presidential, as the candidate and his team have been embroiled in a high-stakes debate over whether he needs to adjust his tone for the general election. “I’m not changing,” he declared just days ago. But in the face of withering criticism it became clear to Trump that he needed to do just that — at least for the evening. Highlighting the critical nature of the speech, Trump spoke with the aid of a pair of teleprompters, which were personally inspected by campaign chairman Paul Manafort before his remarks. Manafort has been the leading proponent within Trump’s campaign for the candidate to moderate his tone and to expand his appeal by appearing more presidential. (Trump has previously mocked other politicians for using teleprompters on the campaign trail and has called for them to be banned.) Trump made a direct appeal to supporters of vanquished Democrat Bernie Sanders, who he said failed in a “rigged” system that benefited Clinton. “We welcome you with open arms,” Trump said. Gone was the mocking tone Trump has adopted over the past year toward his rivals and their supporters. “To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you very much,” Trump said. “To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support.” The roots of the current Trump crisis stemmed from an attack on U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is hearing the ongoing civil suit over the failed Trump University, called a scam by several attorneys general. Trump said the Indiana-born judge of Mexican heritage should be disqualified from hearing the suit because of the candidate’s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after a weeks-long courtship, blasted Trump’s remark as “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” Illinois Senator Mark Kirk revoked his endorsement of Trump over the comment, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called on his colleagues to rethink their support of the party’s nominee, and Maine Senator Susan Collins left open the possibility of voting for Clinton. And while Trump’s comments may give some Republicans hope that the bombastic front runner can change his tune, many are worrying how long he can keep it up. Trump, who frequently boasts of himself as a “counter-puncher” instead absorbed the blows, issuing a statement that was as close as he has come to an apology this cycle. “It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,” a statement from Trump read Tuesday. His remarks Tuesday evening included an attack on Clinton, but lacked the conservative red meat and conspiracy theories that have defined the last several weeks of his campaign. “We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created those problems,” Trump said, attacking the Clintons for alleged pay-for-access schemes. He also announced that he would deliver a “major address” attacking Clinton on those themes on Monday. The political outsider then cast himself as the only agent of change in the race, in a theme designed to appeal across the political spectrum. “This election isn’t about Republican or Democrat, it’s about who runs this country, the special interests or the people,” he said. “We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created those problems.” Trump opened his remarks in Westchester saying, “Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another.” His statement was an attempt to turn the page, but it remains to be seen how long he can keep reading from it. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Donald Trump is a man who wanted to become the leader of the United States. He had a bad week because some people didn't like the things he said about a judge. He decided to make a speech to show everyone that he can be a good leader. In his speech, he promised to make people proud and said he's the only one who can fix problems in the country. Now, we have to wait and see if he can keep his promises and make people happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Assessing the relevance: The review is about a book, and I need to first ensure that the product I am considering buying is indeed a book. If it's not, then the review is irrelevant, and I'll ignore it. 2. Understanding the review's content: The reviewer states that the book contains a lot of common sense information and lacks any groundbreaking secret to success. This suggests that the book might not provide significant new insights or guidance that I couldn't find elsewhere. 3. Evaluating the reviewer's perspective: The reviewer also mentions that if someone lacks people skills, the book could be beneficial to them. It seems like the book might have some usefulness for specific audiences. 4. Balancing positives and negatives: Although the book could have some value for certain individuals, the overall impression from the review is that the book may not be very helpful for someone who already possesses a certain level of common sense and people skills. Considering these points, the chances of me buying the product (assuming it is the book) would be slightly decreased because the review suggests that the book might not offer a great amount of new and unique insights or knowledge.

The weight of the cement-filled wheelbarrow had been somewhat challenging to maneuver, but Braden's determination and strength saw him through the task, his sweat-soaked brow a testament to his exertions. The sun shone down brightly overhead, casting sharp shadows around the backyard, as the encompassing trees swayed gently in the soft breeze like dancing emerald giants. As Braden set down the empty wheelbarrow, he took a moment to observe the now-filled hole in the ground. He could see the thick, gray cement gradually beginning to settle, slowly forming a solid and stable structure that would soon become the foundation for a magnificent addition to his backyard oasis. This new feature, a custom-built fire pit surrounded by elegant pavers, would be a place for reconnecting with family and friends, a sanctuary for sharing laughter, stories, and the warmth of shared experiences. Stepping back, Braden wiped the sweat from his forehead and reached for the cold drink he had left resting on a nearby table. The cool, refreshing liquid quenched his thirst, rejuvenating his spirit and fueling his determination to see this project through to completion. With the cement now in place, the next phase of construction could begin; laying the bricks that would comprise the fire pit's outer structure, carefully chosen for their attractiveness and resilience against the elements. Then, the paver stones surrounding the pit would complete the overall aesthetic, complementing the surrounding landscaping and creating the perfect focal point for his backyard haven. As the cement dries, Braden anticipates the challenges that lie ahead, aware of the dedication and attention to detail required to bring his vision to fruition. He mentally prepares himself for the precise planning and execution involved in both bricklaying and paver installation, knowing that his backyard retreat hinges on his ability to transform raw materials into a harmonious, unified space, that will offer years of enjoyment for himself and his loved ones. The satisfaction he will feel when the final stone is placed cannot be understated. He can already envision the gleaming firelight, the soft crackle of wood as it burns, and the soothing ambiance only a backyard fire pit can provide. With renewed energy, Braden takes a deep breath, focusing on the task at hand and committing himself to laying brick after brick, stone after stone, until his masterwork is complete. And as the day unfolds, punctuated by the rhythm of his hammer, the scrape of his trowel, and the gentle laying of each integral piece, the vision of his backyard sanctuary grows steadily closer to reality and stands as a testament to the power of human ingenuity, tireless effort, and the enduring desire to create places of comfort, joy, and connection, nestled within the heart of one's very own home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is Italy's national flower","output":"Italy's national flower is the Lily, specifically the Strelitzia Reginae, also known as the \\"Flower of the Lily\\" or \\"Giglio.\\" The Lily holds great historical, cultural, and symbolic significance throughout Italy and has been cherished for centuries. The beautiful Giglio can be found in art, architecture, and Italian culture, both traditional and modern. The Lily is a perennial, bulbous plant that belongs to the Liliaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America and is widely cultivated in different parts of the world for its vibrant colors and elegant appearance. The Strelitzia Reginae is a unique and striking species of the Lily that features bold and bright colors like yellow and orange combined with a royal blue. The flowers have a distinct, elongated shape, with six tepals (a combination of petals and sepals) and six stamens. The symbolic meaning of the Lily in Italy traces back to the ancient Roman Empire. Some Roman emperors were known to have used the Lily as a symbol of power and authority. The Lily has also been associated with the Roman goddess Juno, who was the queen of the gods and wife of Jupiter. During the Middle Ages, the Lily became a symbol of the Virgin Mary in Italy, representing purity, innocence, and compassion. Italian artworks and frescoes from this period often depict the Lily alongside the Madonna and Child. In the Renaissance period, the Lily continued to hold symbolic importance in Italy. The city of Florence, which was a major cultural and artistic hub during the Renaissance, adopted the Lily as its emblem and symbol of civic pride. The emblem, known as the \\"Giglio Fiorentino,\\" is a stylized version of the Strelitzia Reginae, and is often seen in Florentine architecture, art, and fashion. In modern times, the Lily remains a beloved symbol in Italian culture. The Giglio Fiorentino is still prominently featured in the official emblem of the city of Florence, and Lilies can be found in gardens, floral arrangements, and as decorative elements throughout Italy. The Lily is also used to represent Italian sports teams, such as ACF Fiorentina, a professional football club based in Florence. It is not just a symbol of beauty in Italy, but also of a rich historical and cultural heritage. The Lily has become an enduring emblem of Italy's national identity, representing the nation's passion for art and its fascinating history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin (  21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and...  - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide.  - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America.

Every day in medical offices around the country, physicians hand patients prescriptions for drugs to treat conditions for which the medicines haven't been approved. Once a drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a doctor can, with rare exceptions, legally prescribe it \\"off label\\": for use as he or she sees fit. That's a primary reason people with depression or attention-deficit disorder are prescribed drugs approved to treat seizures, acne patients are given prescriptions for antibiotics, and insomniacs are advised to take a schizophrenia drug. And it's why tens of millions of post-menopausal women for years were told to take estrogen, a drug approved to treat osteoporosis, as a way of staving off heart disease, improving their mood and memory, and smoothing wrinkles. Off-label use of drugs may be axiomatic in medicine, but a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine finds that the practice is frequently grounded more in anecdote than in hard science. Using data from a national survey of 3,500 office-based physicians, researchers found that 21 percent of the 725 million prescriptions written in 2001 were for off-label uses. Seventy-three percent of these prescriptions lacked strong scientific justification, such as a clinical trial, and were based on observational studies, case reports or no discernable evidence. And without solid evidence of safety and effectiveness, the researchers maintain, consumers run the risk of taking ineffective, expensive and potentially dangerous drugs. Estrogen is one such example. Only after doctors had prescribed it for decades to prevent a panoply of problems did a large clinical trial in 2002 find that the hormone actually increased the risk of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, incontinence and dementia. The new study, funded by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, compared patients' diagnoses with labeling information from the 100 most commonly prescribed drugs, as well as 60 randomly selected medications. Researchers then assessed the amount of scientific support for each case of off-label use. Some prescriptions were logical extensions of the approved labeling, such as giving an asthma drug to treat another lung ailment. Others were less clear, such as using a seizure drug to quell anxiety. \\"There is enormous variation in the reason drugs are used off-label, from extremely good evidence to experimentation,\\" said Randall Stafford, one of the study's co-authors. Stafford, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said he was surprised by how many prescriptions were written without solid scientific justification. In psychiatry, for example, researchers found that 96 percent of off-label prescriptions lacked strong scientific support. David Schopick, who practices in Portsmouth, N.H., said he thinks some of his fellow child psychiatrists \\"draw the line where we think our colleagues draw the line\\" between innovation, which is ethical, and experimentation, which is not. Enthusiasm for off-label prescribing has waned somewhat in psychiatry, he added, because of reports that antidepressants may trigger suicidal behavior in teenagers. \\"So much of what we prescribe has not been shown to be effective\\" in children, but has been approved for adults, he added. In addition to psychiatric medications, drugs to treat heart disease, asthma, allergies and seizures are commonly prescribed for unapproved uses, the study found. Drugs used to lower cholesterol and control diabetes were least likely to be prescribed for other conditions, researchers found. Reasons for the burgeoning practice vary, Stafford and other experts say. Some doctors may be swayed by small, promising studies funded by manufacturers tempted to increase a drug's sales without going through the expensive, time-consuming process of expanding its approved uses. (FDA regulations prohibit companies from marketing a drug to treat a condition for which it hasn't been specifically approved.) In other cases, influential practitioners known as \\"thought leaders\\" in their specialty may endorse the use of a drug, their views then spread by word of mouth, especially at conferences. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Off-label drug use means doctors prescribe medicines for treating conditions that the medications haven't been officially approved for. Although this practice is legal, many times it is based more on personal experiences and anecdotes rather than strong scientific evidence, which can lead to patients taking potentially ineffective, costly, and risky drugs."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Which event happened two years after the Russo-Japanese War ended?\\"  Context: \\"When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica, was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente.

Abby Wambach, the skillful forward for the U.S. women's soccer team, scored dramatic headers against Brazil and France to help the American team advance to the World Cup final. Now she's heading off to the championship match against a tough Japan team, a much-awaited contest set for Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany -- where the U.S. can win the tournament for a record third time. The 31-year-old Wambach, speaking to CNN in a phone interview on Thursday, bubbled with confidence, patriotism, and enthusiasm as the team bids to follow up its 1991 and 1999 successes. She thinks the United States can beat Japan, a team emboldened to score a victory for a nation wracked with tragedy this year after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the country. Who will star at the women's World Cup? Japan, she said, is a \\"possession-oriented\\" squad that's \\"technical on the ball.\\" \\"We have to be patient. We're going to get chances and have moments where we can score goals, and I think physically we're going to be able to dominate them,\\" she said. \\"So, if we can take care of the chances that we get, put away goals early on.\\" Wambach, according to her bio on the U.S. team website, has \\"developed into one of the most dangerous goal scorers in the world\\" and is \\"one of the world's best players in the air\\" -- as proven by her heading skills. The U.S. advanced to the final after defeating France 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. Wambach scored the second in the 79th minute with a dramatic header, her third goal of the tournament so far. And her last-gasp headed goal against Brazil on Sunday -- which got her an ESPN ESPY award for \\"best play\\" -- helped the U.S. level at 2-2 and take the quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, in which she also scored. Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? \\"Some say maybe it was perfect timing for us,\\" she said, noting she was humbled and honored by the ESPY award. \\"We believe it's our destiny.\\" People are gathering in sports bars to cheer on the U.S. team, and the American support for the World Cup team has thrilled the players. \\"Pretty amazing,\\" said Wambach. \\"We really want to make everybody back home proud. We're going to keep this thing going. We have this huge game on Sunday and if we can all play well and keep giving our most and leave everything on the field, hopefully we'll come home as World Cup champs.\\" Wambach was asked whether she will have another shot at a World Cup, which is played every four years. \\"It's a good question but right now my focus is here (in Germany),\\" she said. \\"This team is special. And this team, I can't put my finger on what makes this team so special, but the fact is we just don't give up. We're not quitters. We won't give up for the entire 90 minutes that we play on Sunday. \\"I think we can do this.

The final match against Japan was highly anticipated and took place in Frankfurt, Germany. Wambach held immense confidence in her team's ability to secure the title for the third time, after previous victories in 1991 and 1999. Wambach recognized Japan as a technically skilled and possession-oriented team, but believed that the United States had the physical advantage. The U.S. team hoped to capitalize on the chances they received to score crucial goals. Wambach was known as a dangerous goal scorer and one of the world's best players when it came to her heading skills.

In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like  Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.

The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic Nativist riots had erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city. Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559.

Summarize this article: An experimental drug derived from peanuts protected some children and adolescents with life-threatening peanut allergies, according to a study, allowing the subjects to eat small amounts of peanuts without suffering a serious reaction.      The drug, from a small California company, Aimmune Therapeutics, didn’t work for everyone, has some side effects and hasn’t been approved by regulators for sale. Yet the findings from the late-stage trial promise a potential new solution for peanut allergies, a growing concern.      ... ||||| Abstract      Background      Peanut allergy, for which there are no approved treatment options, affects patients who are at risk for unpredictable and occasionally life-threatening allergic reactions.      Methods      In a phase 3 trial, we screened participants 4 to 55 years of age with peanut allergy for allergic dose-limiting symptoms at a challenge dose of 100 mg or less of peanut protein (approximately one third of a peanut kernel) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Participants with an allergic response were randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive AR101 (a peanut-derived investigational biologic oral immunotherapy drug) or placebo in an escalating-dose program. Participants who completed the regimen (i.e., received 300 mg per day of the maintenance regimen for approximately 24 weeks) underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at trial exit. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants 4 to 17 years of age who could ingest a challenge dose of 600 mg or more, without dose-limiting symptoms.      Results      Of the 551 participants who received AR101 or placebo, 496 were 4 to 17 years of age; of these, 250 of 372 participants (67.2%) who received active treatment, as compared with 5 of 124 participants (4.0%) who received placebo, were able to ingest a dose of 600 mg or more of peanut protein, without dose-limiting symptoms, at the exit food challenge (difference, 63.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 53.0 to 73.3; P<0.001). During the exit food challenge, the maximum severity of symptoms was moderate in 25% of the participants in the active-drug group and 59% of those in the placebo group and severe in 5% and 11%, respectively. Adverse events during the intervention period affected more than 95% of the participants 4 to 17 years of age. A total of 34.7% of the participants in the active-drug group had mild events, as compared with 50.0% of those in the placebo group; 59.7% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively, had events that were graded as moderate, and 4.3% and 0.8%, respectively, had events that were graded as severe. Efficacy was not shown in the participants 18 years of age or older.      Conclusions      In this phase 3 trial of oral immunotherapy in children and adolescents who were highly allergic to peanut, treatment with AR101 resulted in higher doses of peanut protein that could be ingested without dose-limiting symptoms and in lower symptom severity during peanut exposure at the exit food challenge than placebo. (Funded by Aimmune Therapeutics; PALISADE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02635776.) ||||| Experts who were not involved in the trial said the outcomes exceeded their expectations, calling the results “potentially lifesaving.” But they also cautioned that the treatment does not cure peanut allergies and should not be attempted at home. They emphasized that children who complete the regimen need to continue to eat a peanut-free diet and may need to keep up maintenance therapy with minute doses of peanut, possibly for the rest of their lives.      “This is not the cure, but it is a good first step,” said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., chief medical officer of Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a nonprofit advocacy group that focuses on food allergies, noting the results were better than he expected. Until now, he said, “We’ve had nothing, nothing to give these poor kids that can keep them from having these reactions and put them in a much more positive outlook on life. It’s just a wonderful thing to have.      “The fact that the kids were eating the equivalent of a peanut a day pretty much tells you that if they accidentally eat a peanut, they won’t have a life-threatening reaction,” Dr. Baker said.      Michael Perkin, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatric allergy consultant at St. George’s, University of London who wrote an accompanying editorial about the study, said the regimen was “not a walk in the park” and requires tremendous discipline. Children are required to rest for two hours after receiving their daily dose but cannot fall asleep because of the risk of a reaction.      Dr. Perkin said that the long-term side effects of consuming allergens when one has a severe allergy are still unknown. But he described the results as “beyond exciting.”      “It isn’t a cure like an antibiotic that makes a bug go away and it’s not there anymore,” he said. But “psychologically it makes a massive difference if you can keep your kid from living in fear. These kids can eat enough peanut that parents no longer will have to worry about their teenage daughter kissing someone who’s eaten peanut butter. You cannot estimate what a psychological relief that is.”      For children like Carter Grodi, a junior in high school in Ocala, Fla., who completed the treatment a year ago and continues to ingest a small amount of peanut every day to maintain his low-level tolerance, the treatment was transformative, making it easier to go out with friends and make plans to go away for college. ||||| Summary:","output":"An experimental peanut-derived drug named AR101 has shown promise in treating some children and adolescents with life-threatening peanut allergies, according to a study by Aimmune Therapeutics.

It is the southern entrance to the city of Alice Springs and in addition to the Todd River it carries the main road and rail access to the South . The Gap was an important sacred site for the Arrernte people and its use as a thoroughfare was avoided prior to the construction of the road and later rail link . The Gap was named by William Mills , the Overland Telegraph line surveyor who discovered the location for Alice Springs . It was named after his former school in Heavitree , Devon .  - Richard Hooker (March 1554  3 November 1600) was an English priest in the Church of England and an influential theologian. He was one of the most important English theologians of the sixteenth century. His defence of the role of redeemed reason informed the theology of the seventeenth century Caroline divines and later provided many members of the Church of England with a theological method which combined the claims of revelation, reason and tradition. Scholars disagree regarding Hooker's relationship with what would later be called \\"Anglicanism\\" and the Reformed theological tradition. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the originator of the Anglican \\"via media\\" between Protestantism and Catholicism. However, a growing number of scholars have argued that he should be considered as being in the mainstream Reformed theology of his time and that he only sought to oppose the extremists, (Puritans) rather than moving the Church of England away from Protestantism.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into.

In music, a single, record single or music single is a type of release, typically a song recording of fewer tracks than an LP record, an album or an EP record. This can be released for sale to the public in a variety of different formats. In most cases, a single is a song that is released separately from an album, although it usually also appears on an album. Typically, these are the songs from albums that are released separately for promotional uses such as digital download or commercial radio airplay and are expected to be the most popular. In other cases a recording released as a single may not appear on an album.  As digital downloading and audio streaming have become more prevalent, it is often possible for every track on an album to also be available separately. Nevertheless, the concept of a single for an album has been retained as an identification of a more heavily promoted or more popular song (or group of songs) within an album collection.  Despite being referred to as a single, singles can include up to as many as three tracks on them.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: to show confidence. By practicing the physical act of appearing confident, you will actually start to feel more confident. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold your chin up, relax your shoulders, and breathe deeply. This will naturally make you seem more attractive to anyone who's around you. The more you practice good posture, the more natural it will feel. Speaking slowly gives other people the impression that you're confident and knowledgeable. You will also seem more authoritative if you slightly lower your vocal range as you speak.  When you're telling a story, think about each sentence and how it relates to what you're saying. Don't be afraid to leave a pause between sentences while you're speaking. It seems more confident than using filler words like \\"um\\" or \\"like.\\" People who are more physically engaged while they're speaking seem more confident than those who do not.  Gesture with your hands to emphasize strong points. Think about how to use your body to convey a message. For instance, you could lean forward and rest your hand on your chin when you're interested in what someone else is saying. No matter what you look like, you'll be the most attractive when you're happy with how you look. Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. If you wear makeup, play up the features that you like the most. Alpha males are attracted to confidence, and wearing too much makeup can make you seem insecure. Keep your makeup natural-looking on most of your face. If you do go bold, emphasize one feature of your face at a time.  For instance, if you wear a bold red lip, opt for a subtle smoky eye and subtle eyeliner. If you go for a dramatic winged liner and dark eyeshadow, try pairing it with a nude lip and a little blush. Smelling good can make you seem more attractive. A little goes a long way, though.

Каркабуэй Which language is this?","output":"The word \\"Каркабуэй\\" appears to be neither in English nor in common European languages such as French, Spanish, Italian, or German. It also does not belong to Slavic languages, including Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian.  After some investigation, it appears that \\"Каркабуэй\\" does not correspond to any known word in widely used languages. It could potentially be a word or a name in a less studied language or local dialect, although without further context it's difficult to ascertain. There are various languages in the world with distinct scripts and spelling conventions, and it's sometimes challenging to identify a particular language with a single isolated word. This situation underscores the importance of context in language identification. Contextual clues can provide more information that makes it easier to identify the language of a specific word or phrase. In scenarios where a single word or phrase's language is unknown and context is not provided, linguistic analysis can focus on factors like the word's script, orthography, phonology, and morphosyntactic structure.  In the case of \\"Каркабуэй,\\" the word's script suggests that it might belong to one of the languages that use the Cyrillic script, which includes Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, and several others. However, the word doesn't seem to correspond to any known words in these languages. In conclusion, based on the information available, it's difficult to confidently determine which language \\"Каркабуэй\\" belongs to. More context or information might be needed to accurately identify the language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer a question about the following article about Southampton: The River Test runs along the western border of the city, separating it from the New Forest. There are bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at Redbridge in the south and the M27 motorway to the north. The River Itchen runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built, is at Mansbridge, where the A27 road crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at Swaythling, where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is Cobden Bridge which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a toll bridge. Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the Northam Road Bridge, which was the first major pre-stressed concrete bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom.

Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.  - The Goldberg Variations, BWV 988, is a work written for harpsichord by Johann Sebastian Bach, consisting of an aria and a set of 30 variations. First published in 1741, the work is considered to be one of the most important examples of variation form. The \\"Variations\\" are named after Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, who may have been the first performer.  - Prelude in C Minor , BWV 999 ) , also termed The \`\` Little '' Prelude in C Minor , is a piece written by Johann Sebastian Bach sometime between 1717 and 1723 . Though originally composed for Lute - Harpsichord , it has since been adapted for various instruments , including lute , piano and guitar . It is a pedagogical work much in the spirit of The Well - Tempered Clavier , with which it shares musical characteristics . The piece 's true authorship fell into question for decades before being proven to be Bach 's by publication of Hans Neemann 's J. S. Bach Lautenkompositionen ( 1931 ) .  - A harpsichord is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. It produces sound by plucking a string when a key is pressed.  - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.  - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.  - A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard. The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings.  - The Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846893, is a collection of two series of Preludes and Fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, composed for solo keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach. In the German of Bach's time \\"Clavier\\" (keyboard) was a generic name indicating a variety of keyboard instruments, most typically a harpsichord or clavichord  but not excluding an organ either.

However, I can provide some possible emotions and reasons he might feel that way. 1. Relieved: If Austin was uncomfortable with the attention being on him, he might feel relieved that the focus has shifted to his friend instead. This could be because he's shy, introverted, or simply didn't want to talk about a particular subject. 2. Guilty: If Austin shifted the focus to his friend for selfish reasons (e.g. to avoid answering a difficult question or sharing personal information), he might feel guilty afterward for not being honest or putting his friend in an uncomfortable position. 3. Supportive: If Austin's intention was to give his friend the opportunity to shine or share their own experiences, he might feel supportive or proud of his friend for being able to engage in the spotlight. This could be due to a genuine desire to uplift and celebrate his friend's achievements or experiences. 4. Indifferent: If the attention shifting didn't have any significant impact on Austin or he didn't mind it in the first place, he might not feel any strong emotions afterward and be indifferent to the situation.
