According to the results of an investigation launched by authorities, more than a third of the employees working in the chain's kitchens across the country lacked proper documentation to work in the United States. The news has shocked customers and put pressure on the chain's management to take decisive action. Sources reported that authorities had launched an investigation into the restaurant chain following several complaints alleging that the restaurant was using undocumented workers. After conducting thorough investigations, the government found that 36% of the chain's 7,000-strong kitchen staff did not have the necessary paperwork to work in the U.S. Given the alarming nature of the findings, the government is now considering legal action against the chain. Under the U.S. law, hiring undocumented immigrants is deemed to be a serious offence, with stiff penalties imposed on those who violate the rules. In light of the revelations, the chain released a statement expressing great concern about the situation. While the company pledged to work with the government to ensure that the appropriate measures were in place to guarantee compliance with the law, it also indicated that it would not tolerate any form of exploitation or abuse of its employees. The news of the investigation and the chain’s alleged workplace misconduct has sparked outrage nationwide. Many customers have called for a boycott of the restaurant chain, while others have rallied in support of its undocumented workers, arguing that vulnerable immigrants need better protection from exploitation by their employers. The chain is now facing a major reputational crisis and potential legal action. As the matter progresses through the courts, it is likely that the government will impose harsh penalties on the chain, providing a strong basis from which authorities can send a stern message to other employers that engaging with undocumented staff will not be tolerated."},{"instruction":"Given John Smith, a renowned biologist, has conducted extensive research on the behavior of chimpanzees in their natural habitat.

He faces up to 29 years in prison. The verdict is being hailed as a huge win for the #MeToo movement, which sparked a wave of allegations against powerful men in the entertainment industry.","output":"Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault in a New York court. The verdict has been hailed as a significant win for the #MeToo movement, which sparked outrage and led to a wave of allegations against powerful men in the entertainment industry. Weinstein, once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, was convicted of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and raping former actress Jessica Mann in 2013. He was found not guilty on the most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have put him in prison for life, but still faces up to 29 years in jail. His lawyers have already announced their intention to appeal the verdict. During the trial, which lasted over a month, the prosecution presented graphic testimony from several women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Prosecutors argued that the producer had used his power and influence in the industry to coerce young actresses and other women into sexual acts. Weinstein's defense team argued that all of the encounters were consensual and that the women had continued to have friendly relationships with him after the alleged assaults. After the verdict was announced, many of Weinstein's accusers expressed their relief and satisfaction with the outcome. Some also expressed disappointment that he had not been convicted on all charges. The #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017 after multiple allegations of sexual abuse against Hollywood mogul Weinstein, prompted a long-overdue conversation about sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The movement has since spread across the globe, resulting in the downfall of numerous high-profile men accused of misconduct. The Weinstein case, which played out in the public eye amidst a flurry of media attention and protests, has been seen as a test of the #MeToo movement's ability to hold powerful men accountable for their actions. With the verdict now in, many see this as a turning point in the fight against sexual misconduct and a warning to others who might use their position of power to prey on vulnerable individuals."},{"instruction":"Examine the two statements and decide if they convey the same information.

This discovery was made by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier in 2012. The CRISPR technology involves using a molecule known as Cas9, which is a protein that can cut DNA at specific locations, and a guide that determines where the protein should cut. The implications of this discovery are vast and could lead to advances in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Currently, researchers are exploring the use of CRISPR in developing treatments for genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. This technology could also help prevent the spread of diseases by selectively targeting infected cells. Despite the great potential of CRISPR technology, there have been controversies and ethical concerns raised by its use. One issue is the possibility of editing the genes of embryos, which raises questions about the ethics of creating genetically modified children. Another concern is the potential for unintended consequences or unforeseen side effects of gene editing. Additional research is needed in the field to fully understand the long-term implications of gene editing and to develop appropriate guidelines for its use. Many scientists are currently working to refine the CRISPR technology and to explore potential applications in fields such as environmental and agricultural science. In summary, the discovery of CRISPR technology has great potential for improving human health and the world around us. However, it is important to approach this technology with caution and to continue research to fully understand its implications and to ensure responsible use."},{"instruction":"formation: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J.K.

The asteroid is believed to be composed almost entirely of iron and nickel, making it highly valuable for potential future mining operations. The mission, which has been in the works for several years, will aim to explore the surface of Psyche 16 using advanced instruments mounted on a spacecraft.

Apple has said that it has received 26 reports of overheating batteries so far, but no injuries have been reported. As a precautionary measure, the company has urged customers to discontinue the use of the affected MacBook Pro models until they have been serviced by Apple. In a statement on its website, Apple said that it had \\"determined that, in a limited number of older generation 15-inch MacBook Pro units, the battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk\\". The company has provided users with a free battery replacement service for affected MacBook Pro models. Apple has also offered to handle the entire process, saying that users are welcome to take their MacBook Pro to an Apple authorized service provider. Alternatively, customers are also welcome to visit an official Apple store for assistance. The replacement batteries are expected to arrive within two weeks, and Apple has said that the service should take approximately one hour to complete. The recall of MacBook Pro models is just one in a series of safety recalls issued by Apple in recent years. In 2018, the company issued a recall for iPhone 8, which had a faulty logic board that caused unexpected reboots, freezes, and even prevented the phone from turning on. Earlier this year, Apple also issued a recall for certain wall plug adapters that were sold outside of the US due to the risk of electrical shock. Apple has advised customers to check if their MacBook Pro is affected and to take appropriate action. The company has also reiterated that the recall does not affect any other MacBook Pro models or Apple laptops."},{"instruction":"Suppose it's true that Queen Elizabeth II is the longestreigning monarch in British history.
