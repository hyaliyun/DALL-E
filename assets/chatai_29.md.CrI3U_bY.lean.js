Please answer the following question: SINGAPORE — What now? That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... Question: What are Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump? Options:  A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions  B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects  C. not enough information  D. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him  === The correct answer is A:","output":"While it is difficult to pinpoint Kim Jong Un's exact motivations in meeting with Trump, it is likely that his motivations include a combination of options A, B, and D. A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions: It is possible that Kim Jong Un sees a genuine opportunity in working with Trump to bring about changes to the region. By agreeing to denuclearize, Kim Jong Un could gain economic benefits for his country as a result of the lifting of sanctions. This, in turn, could help build a stronger economy and improve the living standards for the citizens of North Korea, which could potentially strengthen Kim Jong Un's grip on power. B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects: Kim Jong Un's decision to meet with Trump was a historic event and has undoubtedly increased his profile on the global stage. By engaging in dialogue with the United States, he has portrayed himself as a competent and reasonable leader, improving his image both internationally and domestically. D. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him: It is possible that Kim Jong Un intends to use his interactions with Trump to buy time and continue developing his nuclear program covertly. Additionally, he could be trying to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies in the region, such as South Korea and Japan, in order to weaken the US's influence over East Asia. In conclusion, Kim Jong Un's motivations for meeting with Trump are likely multifaceted and may include a combination of admiration for Trump, a desire to appear as a competent statesman, and a strategic plan to deceive the US and its allies. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the precise weight of each of these factors in Kim Jong Un's decision-making process."},{"instruction":"Q:You are considering whether to buy a product.

Sexual orientation Innate bisexuality is an idea introduced by Sigmund Freud. According to this theory, all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term, that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes. In Freud's view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures.

Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the fall, for the year ending July 2014, meant deforestation was at its second lowest level in 25 years. But campaigners say alternative monitoring shows an increase for a second year running. In 2012 the government eased restrictions on landowners, weakening legal protection for the rainforest. Ms Teixeira said 4,848 square kilometres (1,872 square miles) of rainforest were destroyed between August 2013 and July 2014. The figure was down from 5,891 kilometres (2,275 square miles) during the same period a year earlier. But a spokesman for the World Wide Fund for Nature said alternative satellite monitoring systems, not used by the government, in fact suggested an increase in the rate of forest destruction for a second year running. A non-government group, Imazon, which uses satellite pictures to measure deforestation warned last week of a 467% rise in October from the same month a year earlier.

Write a summary based on this article: A southern Queensland man has been charged for allegedly stealing cattle gallstones from an abattoir outside Toowoomba.      The 38-year-old is accused of stealing the gallstones, which are prized in eastern medicine and can be worth 20,000 a kilogram, over six months from the Oakey slaughterhouse.      The Toowoomba stock and rural crime investigation squad this week raided a property at Cranley and a 38-year-old man was charged. He will appear in the Toowoomba magistrates court on 23 June.      “Having dealings with the industry … we know that in the abattoir game they do actually lock up and secure these gallstones, because of their value, but it’s definitely not something we’ve come across too often,” said Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Brendan Murphy of the Toowoomba stock and rural crime investigations squad.      Murphy said police had to act fast because the small gallstones are easy to dispose of.      “There was a good chance they were going to be in the fridge,” he said. “If they weren’t in the fridge we would have been looking all day.”      Cattle gallstones are used in alternative medicine to treat hepatitis and other liver and gall bladder-related ailments.            They form in a variety of shapes and sizes, and their value is determined by colour, texture, size and dryness.            “It appears to me a bit like valuing gemstones - you have good ones and bad ones,” Murphy said. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Photo: Supplied      A 38-year-old man has been charged with stealing cattle gallstones, which can apparently sell for as much as 20,000 a kilogram.      The stones are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the belief they can treat hepatitis and other liver and heart-related diseases.      Acting on a tip-off, officers from the Stock and Rural Crime Investigation Squad (SARCIS) raided a property in the Toowoomba suburb of Cranley on Thursday, uncovering a hoard of the stones.      Police allege they were stolen from a nearby abattoir over six months and are believed to be of \\"considerable value\\".      Advertisement      Toowoomba SARCIS Senior Constable Glenn Evans said the stones had been valued but he wouldn't say how much they were worth.      \\"It was less than half a kilo, of varying quality,\\" he said.      \\"They certainly weren't all top-quality stones.      \\"We don't want to blow it out of proportion. It was nowhere near the 20,000 mark.\\"      He says gallstone theft does happen but it's not common.      \\"I couldn't comment on how often but it isn't common because if you consider there aren't that many avenues for collecting them,\\" he said.      Gallstones are small, hard masses that form in the gallbladder from a digestive fluid called bile and can be very painful.      Griffith University traditional chinese medicine (TCM) expert Dr Yunjiang Feng said gallstones were a \\"very common\\" ingredient among practitioners.      \\"It is believed however it formed should have some effect to cure where it is produced,\\" she said.      \\"They believe the stone is formed in problems with cattle between heart and liver, therefore this can be used to treat diseases related to (those) organs.      \\"So as a result it can be used for many different things related to heart and liver disease.\\"      Dr Feng said although there were many TCM practitioners in Australia, she believed cattle gallstones would mostly be sent overseas to China and other Asian countries where the practice was more common.      She said she imagined the stones would offer \\"some black market attractions\\" because they were in high demand.      A SARCIS blog post said the value was determined by dryness, colour, texture, size and whole and broken pieces.      \\"Whole, smooth, lustrous, golden specimens attract the highest price,\\" the post read.      \\"Dark and pitted stones as well as stones with calcium inclusions (white) are of reduced value.      \\"It is understood that quality stones may reach values of around 20,000 per kilogram.\\"      Contrary to popular belief, gallstones were not an aphrodisiac, police said.      Gold Coast-based cattle gallstone trader Jenny Murtagh told the ABC gallstones were used in Eastern medicine for heart, liver and general wellbeing.      \\"It doesn't cure anything but it's a highly prized product,\\" she said.      The 38-year-old man will face a charge of theft in the Toowoomba Magistrates Court on June 23.      The Australian Medical Association warns there is a substantial gap between the use of complementary medicine, including traditional Chinese medicine, and the evidence to support that use.

I had the honor of hearing Jan Hargrave speak the other day. She is one of four body language experts in the US. Jan Hargrave says we lie with the right side of our brains, so it is our left hand that gives us away. A person touching his nose, pulling at his ear or rubbing his eye with his left hand might be lying to you. Also, a person who, in any way, crosses any fingers might just be lying. That, she says, is a holdover  from childhood, when we crossed our fingers to signal that we didn't mean what we were saying. When children squint  their eyes, move their body away from you, or can't seem to make good eye contact, you may need to ask for a little more clarification. But just as important, children learn early how to read our body language when they are conversing  with us. Here are some acceptance signals to let them know you are interested when they are talking to you. Lean  towards them. Make good eye contact and smile. Open your arms. Let your hands relax with the palms  showing: an open, upward palm always show acceptance. If your legs are crossed, make sure you are not crossing them away from your child. These are important because they signal to your child that you are focused on them and are accepting and welcoming them into your world. By paying attention, we can open those lines of important communication with our children and we can see the truth more clearly.

He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker. Santoro becomes suspicious when he notices that the 'knocked out' Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. In his dressing room, Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the same red-headed woman who tricked Dunne into leaving his post.

Respectively, these reached #2, #2, #5, and #40 on the Hot Country Songs charts, making this the first studio album of Keith's career not to produce any Number One hits.  - Walter Scott \\"Scotty\\" Emerick (born July 11, 1973 in Hollywood, Florida) is an American country music artist, known primarily for his work with Toby Keith. In addition to penning several of Keith's singles, Emetic has also written for Sawyer Brown, George Strait and several other artists. In 2004, Emerick was named \\"Songwriter of the Year\\" by the Nashville Songwriters Association. He recorded an unreleased album, \\"The Coast Is Clear\\", for DreamWorks Records in 2003, and has charted four singles on the country charts, including a No. 24-peaking duet with Keith, \\"I Can't Take You Anywhere\\". One of his songs, \\"What's Up with That\\", was featured in the soundtrack to the film \\"Broken Bridges\\".  - \\"Should've Been a Cowboy\\" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Toby Keith. It was released on February 8, 1993 as his debut single, and was served as the first single released from Keith's self-titled debut studio album, \\"Toby Keith\\".

It also peaked at number 93 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, making it a minor crossover hit.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - George Harvey Strait (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music singer, songwriter, actor, and music producer. He is known as the \\"King of Country\\" and is considered one of the most influential and popular recording artists of all time. He is known for his neotraditionalist country style, cowboy look, and being one of the first and main country artists to bring country music back to its roots and away from the pop country era in the 1980s.  - Sawyer Brown is an American country music band founded in 1981 in Apopka, Florida, by five members of country pop singer Don King's road band: Bobby Randall (guitar) and Jim Scholten (bass guitar), both from Midland, Michigan; Joe Smyth (drums), Gregg \\"Hobie\\" Hubbard (keyboards), and Mark Miller (lead vocals). After King retired in 1981, the five members decided to form a band, first choosing the name Savanna before switching to Sawyer Brown, also the name of a road near where they practiced.

This indicates that the danger is most likely related to the contact made during the sport. Step 3: Comparing options related to danger - Small cuts: Although small cuts may occur during fencing, they are not as common since fencers wear protective clothing to minimize the risk of injury. - Puncture wound: Fencing involves using thrusting weapons like foils, epees, and sabers, which are designed to strike the opponent with the tip of the blade, increasing the risk of puncture wounds. - Injury: It is too broad an option, as it could include several types of injuries related to fencing (puncture wounds, bruises, sprains, etc.). Step 4: Eliminating non-danger-related options - Competition: A common aspect of any sport, not necessarily a danger - Panting: A physical response to exertion, also not considered a danger Step 5: Choosing the best option - Puncture wound The most common danger when participating in the sport of fencing is \\"puncture wound\\" because fencing weapons are designed to strike opponents with their tips, increasing the risk of such injuries.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists drew on diverse sources ranging from bubblegum pop and '50s rock and roll to cabaret theatrics, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with nontraditional gender roles.  - Strawbs (or The Strawbs) are an English rock band founded in 1964. Although the band started out as a bluegrass group they eventually moved on to other styles such as folk rock, progressive rock, and (briefly) glam rock.  - Hounslow is the principal town in the London Borough of Hounslow in Greater London and is part of the historic county of Middlesex. It is a suburban district 10.6 miles (17 km) west south-west of Charing Cross. It forms a larger post town in the TW postcode area and is an economic hub within the capital; it has a large shopping centre which adjoins its high street and a large number of restaurants, cafés and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and London Heathrow Airport. A minority of its workers are employed in Central London, to which the town is connected by rail and tube. Hounslow is part of the TW3 postcode area, though some areas to the west are in TW4 instead. The population of the town, comprising the Hounslow Central, Hounslow Heath and Hounslow South wards, was 41,304 in the 2011 census.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Richard Christopher \\"Rick\\" Wakeman (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist, songwriter, television and radio presenter, and author. He is best known for being in the progressive rock band Yes across five tenures between 1971 and 2004 and for his solo albums released in the 1970s.  - Grave New World is a studio album by English band Strawbs . It was the first album to be released after the departure of Rick Wakeman , under circumstances about which band leader Dave Cousins was very bitter . Cousins has admitted that the track \`\` Tomorrow '' was written about Wakeman . Happily their friendship survived and the two have since performed and recorded together , releasing an album Hummingbird in 2002 . Wakeman 's departure to join prog - rockers Yes caused a lot of predictions of Strawbs demise . Cousins was into the I Ching at the time and he asked the book what he should do . The answer was used in the lyrics for the first track on the album , \`\` Benedictus '' . Blue Weaver , late of Amen Corner , was recruited and considered by most fans to be a more than adequate replacement for Wakeman . The album depicts the story of one man 's life . For instance , the track \`\` Hey Little Man '' represents an older man giving advice to his young son . The songs themselves show the continuation of the movement away from Strawbs ' original folk leanings . Founding member Tony Hooper began to be increasingly uncomfortable with this and left after the recording sessions of this album . The original vinyl album had lavish artwork and included a pamphlet showing the lyrics of each track together with details of instrumentation . The front cover is a reproduction of William Blake 's Glad Day . The album reached number 11 in the UK Album Charts .  - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued.  - Dave Cousins (born David Joseph Hindson, 7 January 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex, England) is an English singer and songwriter, who has been the leader, singer and most active songwriter of Strawbs since 1967.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.    What entity does 'grave new world' has the relation 'genre' with? A:","output":"'Grave New World' has the relation 'genre' with progressive rock, folk rock, and, to a lesser extent, glam rock. The album was released by the English band Strawbs, which experimented with these various musical styles throughout their career. The album showcases a departure from their original folk leanings and a movement towards a more progressive rock sound, incorporating elements of folk rock as well.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which brother had a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes?  Two brothers had very different diets. Vick would constantly eat foods high in fat and would frequently overeat. Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories.  Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

To me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there's precious little substance, unless mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns turn you on. This may be one of those famous 'chick flicks' you've heard so much about.  We're about half-way through this film before anything really happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea looking for tuna, and doesn't come back, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to fend for themselves. Then, in a furious six minutes of screen time, they bury Ulises, Martina gets married again, and her son grows into mid-childhood. This rapid transposition is jarring, to say the least, and very sloppy: after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around, we're suddenly into a full-blown melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called wayward narrative pacing. Five years later, Ulises (as in the wandering superhero Ulysses; get it?), returns to his 'Penelope' (Watling) only to find she's married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably wealthy guy (what does he DO to earn all that dough?) who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, in great anger, questions Ulises about his absence, he tells her that he'll take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she'll understand EVERYTHING. And here's the thing: he DOESN'T take her to the island of Sumatra. The reference just dies somewhere in the script. He DOESN'T really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He DOESN'T acquit himself as an honourable guy, and the movie DOESN'T fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues (fish, reptiles, the sea) he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue. It just doesn't work. The narrative 'arc' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline. I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just couldn't buy his Ulises as any kind of hero (which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be). With moist sensuality, he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil roughly 2,000 times and each and every time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm. This guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. He didn't get laid that often, as I understand it.  This poetic 'device' figures prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of Ulysses' famous 'siren song' (i.e. beautiful maidens singing seductively to far-off sailors, who were doomed if they answered the, well, siren call). If this is what Bigas Luna is up to, you can see the problem -- he's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch-and-grab attempt at High Art. Once again, it just doesn't work, at least in my eyes. Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor, but she gives us a character here who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. It's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for-rent sign on his face (as in vacant), oily 1960s-style hair that looks more like seaweed, and one of those trendy 21st-century 'beards' (you know, four days' growth, no more, no less). He's SUPPOSED to be a dreamy kind of guy (I think), but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script.  But, don't despair, this film is great to look at. Just don't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you're hearing in the way of dialogue.

Article: Common sense would tell us that physically active children may be more likely to become active and healthy adults. In the United States, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Just this week, a study reported that life _ has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in fatness, smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only four percent of primary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of eight percent of middle schools and two percent of high schools. The study also found that twenty-two percent of all schools did not require students to take any P.E. Charlene Burgeson , a health expert says one problem for P.E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P.E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition and toward personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P.E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. In the end, schools may find themselves in a no-win situation.   Question: According to the passage which of the following may not lead to poor health?   Options: (A) Fatness.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that convinces Lorna that she shouldn't have to suffer alone? ?  Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him. She quickly breaks away, and says she cannot see him any more. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person that convinces Lorna that she shouldn't have to suffer alone is Drake. Ensign Alan Drake is the one who visits her at her home and encourages her not to suffer alone, spending time with her and providing support during her difficult time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Delicate sounds and fine overtones were mostly lost, because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances.

NEW YORK—Investors staged a global flight from risk Thursday that sent U.S. stocks plummeting and 10-year Treasury yields to 1940s levels, after a gloomy outlook by the Federal Reserve renewed fears of a global economic slowdown.      Investors staged a global flight from risk Thursday that sent stocks plummeting and 10-year Treasury yields to 1940s levels renewed fears of a global economic slowdown. Paul Vigna, Dave Callaway and Bob O'Brien discuss on The News Hub.      The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 391.01 points, or 3.5%, to 10733.83, as investors barreled out of stocks and into \\"safe\\" assets like the U.S. dollar, which surged. The blue-chip measure fell more than 500 points in afternoon action, averting its lowest close in a year with a late-session lift. The action built on the stock market's Wednesday selloff, when the Fed acknowledged \\"significant\\" downside risks to the economy and noted \\"strains\\" in global financial markets, a reference to debt-strapped Europe.      A weak reading on manufacturing in China contributed to the slowdown fears. Adding to the grim mood was a lack of appreciable progress in containing Europe's debt crisis, which has weighed on markets for months.      The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 37.20 points, or 3.2%, to 1129.56, after touching its lowest intraday level since early August. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite slumped 82.52 points, or 3.2%, to 2455.67.

All blue-chip stocks finished in the red, as did all S&P 500 sectors. Materials and energy stocks were hit hardest, falling as investors acted on their economic slowdown worries and in reaction to the fast rise of the U.S. dollar.      \\"They're selling literally everything,\\" said Alan Valdes, director of floor trading at DME Securities at the New York Stock Exchange. \\"It's the realization that things aren't getting better that has traders concerned.

New claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 423,000, according to the Labor Department. The level remains too high to suggest much improvement in the stubbornly weak U.S. jobs market. In addition, the previous week's figure was revised to reflect more jobless claims.      Investors also shrugged off other modestly positive economic data Thursday morning. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators increased for the fourth consecutive month in August and government data showed that U.S. home prices increased in July for the fourth straight month.      In the backdrop was a flareup in U.S. debt worries, the result of the surprise failure of a bill to fund the U.S. government through mid-November. Conservative Republicans and most Democrats teamed up for the largest defeat inflicted on the Republican House majority this year. The episode was a reminder of market gyrations this summer, when Washington was caught in an impasse of raising the limit on federal borrowing.

Write to Brendan Conway at brendan.conway@dowjones.com ||||| There’s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy, and that’s the kind of thing which makes stocks volatile. This morning, we’re seeing that volatility express itself, with global stocks all falling and US stocks down about 2.5% from where they closed yesterday.      But let’s not kid ourselves that there’s any particular reason why global stocks are falling. And especially, let’s not try to invent some spurious reason for the fall, be it broad and inchoate (“global economy fears”) or weirdly specific (“Federal Reserve pessimism”).      It’s may or may not be helpful, here, to check out the price-and-volume chart of the S&P 500 over the past few days.      You see that little wobble in the mid-afternoon yesterday, before the high-volume sell-off at the end of the day? That was the immediate reaction to the release of the FOMC statement at 2:30pm. The big plunge, on unusually high volume, started about an hour later. And the big drop at the open today was much more notable in price terms than it was in volume terms.      It’s silly to think that the decline in stock-market prices was a rational reaction to the FOMC statement. If the FOMC is more pessimistic than the market expected, that’s normally a good sign for markets, since it implies that monetary policy will remain looser for longer. The market cares about the Fed because the Fed controls monetary policy. And so Fed forecasts are important because they help drive that policy. No one revised down their growth expectations as a result of the FOMC statement.      As a general rule, if you see “fears” or “pessimism” in a market-report headline, that’s code for “the market fell and we don’t know why”, or alternatively “the market is volatile and yet we feel the need to impose some spurious causality onto it”.      This kind of thing matters — because when news organizations run enormous headlines about intraday movements in the stock market, that’s likely to panic the population as a whole. They think that they should care about such things because if it wasn’t important, the media wouldn’t be shouting about it so loudly. And they internalize other fallacious bits of journalistic laziness as well: like the idea that the direction of the stock market is a good proxy for the future health of the economy, or the idea that rising stocks are always a good thing and falling stocks are always a bad thing.      Or, most invidiously, the idea that the most interesting and important time period when looking at the stock market is one day. The single most reported statistic with regard to the stock market is where it closed, today, compared to where it closed yesterday. It’s an utterly random and pointless number, but because the media treats it with such reverence, the public inevitably gets the impression that it matters.      Here’s a more useful stock market chart, for the vast majority of people for whom the stock market only matters as a long-term investment:      I’m not going to try to read any great narrative into this chart. But if you want to explain stocks to the broad population, this is the sort of thing you should be showing them. Rather than useless and irrelevant news about what happened to stock prices this morning. |||||       MarketWatch      NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stocks were thrashed Thursday, with the major indexes taking their hardest single-day hit in five weeks, amid widespread selling of stocks and commodities on escalated fears about the global economy.      “This is a class example of indiscriminate selling to raise cash, it’s not a selective process here,” said Art Hogan, head of product strategy, equity research at Lazard Capital Markets.

The negative sentiment taking hold among investors is “driven by the bank runs in Europe, and some of the European banks are rumored to be looking in the Middle East for capital; it’s like a replay of 2008 for some of the U.S. banks,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, you need to be persuasive. You will be in a better position to convince them if you are well informed. Begin to research your presentation by looking into different dog breeds.  When you talk to your parents, you will want to be as specific as possible. You will sound more convincing if you are able to make definitive statements such as, \\"Mom, Dad, the Jack Russell Terrier is the right dog for us.\\" Start by looking at different dog breeds online. You can even take a quiz about what type of dog is right for you.  Use some websites such as the American Kennel Club site to figure out what type of dog you should ask for. For example, if your sister might be allergic, look into a Yorkshire Terrier. If your mom is worried that a dog will be messy, you can look for a dog that doesn't shed heavily. Research dachshunds, which are a small, neat dog. Go to your local or school library. Ask the reference librarian to help you find some books that offer information about different breeds of small dogs. Adopting a dog is a great way to add a pet to your family. With adoption, you can rescue an animal who needs a home. You can also save money, as you won't have to pay an expensive breeder.  Once you have an idea about some of the breeds you are interested in, contact your local animal shelter. The staff and volunteers there will be able to provide you with some helpful information. State that you are looking for a small dog and offer any other specific requirements that you have. For example, tell the staff whether you are looking for a puppy or an older dog. Ask if they regularly have a wide selection of dogs that might fit your needs. For example, you can say, \\"Will it be fairly easy to adopt a small dog such as a dachshund or terrier?\\" Collect other information. Find out what information you and your parents will need to provide in order to adopt a dog. You can also ask how long the process takes. The best way to convince your parents to let you have a dog is to prepare a thoroughly researched presentation. You will definitely want to include the financial aspects of dog ownership in your request. Do some research about how much it costs to adopt and raise a dog.  Talk to the experts. You can ask the staff at the shelter how much the adoption fees are and if you will need to pay for vaccinations. Contact a local vet. You can phone the office and ask for general pricing information. Ask how much it will cost to spay or neuter a dog, and how much regular office check-ups cost. Visit a local pet store. You can price food, toys, and grooming products. Combine all of your information to figure out the monthly cost of dog ownership. If you plan to pay for part of the dog's care, make that part of your presentation, too. Your parents will want to make sure that you understand how much time it takes to care for a dog. For the next part of your presentation preparation, figure out how you will fit dog care into your family's routine. This will help show your parents that you have put a lot of thought into caring for the dog.  Think about how much time it will take to exercise your dog each day. Do you have a yard where he can play independently? Or will you need to make sure to walk him? If you are asking for a puppy, think about how long it will take to train the dog. Are you planning to spend some time each day helping to house train the dog? Make a calendar that shows the breakdown of how much time you will spend caring for the dog. If you are asking other family members to help, make sure to make that clear. Summary:","output":"In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, start by researching different dog breeds to find one that suits your family's needs and preferences. Use resources like the American Kennel Club website and your local library to gather information. Consider factors like allergies and preferences for dog size and temperament. Contact your local animal shelter to learn about the adoption process, fees, and available dogs. Gather information on the financial aspects of dog ownership, such as vet costs, spaying or neutering, vaccines, food, toys, and grooming products. Calculate the monthly cost of caring for a dog and, if possible, commit to contributing to these expenses. Create a detailed plan for integrating the dog into your family's routine, considering factors like exercise, training, and care responsibilities.

Answer the following question: Here's a question: Where is a good place in a home to keep an extra eyeglasses case?  Here are possible answers to this question: - bag - desk - drawer - shirt pocket - car  I believe the correct choice is \\"drawer\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A good place in a home to keep an extra eyeglasses case is indeed in a \\"drawer\\", and here's why: 1. Accessibility: Keeping an extra eyeglasses case in a drawer, such as your nightstand or office desk, allows you easy access when you need it. You'll know exactly where it is and be able to locate it easily. 2. Protection: Storing an extra eyeglasses case in a drawer offers protection for both the case and your eyeglasses from potential damage. Drawers typically provide a stable, less exposed environment that keeps the case and your eyeglasses safe from dust, moisture, and accidental bumps or falls. 3. Organization: Drawers are ideal for keeping personal belongings and household items organized. By allocating a specific drawer for your extra eyeglasses case (possibly alongside other essential items and daily accessories), you maintain a clutter-free environment and minimize the chances of misplacing or losing the case. 4. Limited space: Most homes have limited space to store personal items. Since drawers are a common feature in bedrooms, living areas, and workspaces, it makes sense to utilize them for storing extra items such as an eyeglasses case. Designating a drawer for the case keeps it secure without sacrificing additional storage space or surface area. In comparison to the other options mentioned: - Bag: While a bag is portable and can be carried with you, it may not be a convenient choice for home storage, as the eyeglasses case can easily get lost in the bag's contents or become difficult to access quickly. - Desk: Placing an extra eyeglasses case on your desk might seem convenient, but it can contribute to clutter and the risk of damage due to accidental falls or spills. - Shirt pocket: A shirt pocket is not a stable or secure place for storing an extra eyeglasses case at home, as it is susceptible to being misplaced, dropped, or damaged. - Car: Storing an extra eyeglasses case in the car can be practical for on-the-go use but may not be helpful when you need it at home. Additionally, depending on the environment, the case or eyeglasses may be exposed to temperature fluctuations, which could cause damage. In summary, keeping an extra eyeglasses case in a designated drawer at home is an excellent choice for accessibility, protection, organization, and efficient use of space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that performed on the Sound+Vision Tour?, using the article: Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the..., what would be the answer ?

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your job is to generate a story 100 to 1000 words long, that includes all the facts given as input in their order of appearance while expanding upon them to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Problem:Fact1: Emma marries Anxious to escape mother, Fact2: tie between them keep in touch by telephone, Fact3: lonely Aurora begins whirlwind romance with next door neighbor, Fact4: Aurora stays by Emma 's side through treatment and hospitalization ends relationship, Fact5: Garrett begins to bond with Emma 's young children Solution:","output":"Explanation: The task requires the generation of a story with a length of 100 to 1000 words. The story must include the five ordered key facts while expanding upon them to create a broader and coherent narrative.  Guidelines: 1. Include all five key facts in the story. 2. Follow the order of appearance for the key facts. 3. Expand the narrative while maintaining coherence. Solution: Emma had always been close with her mother, but as she got older, their relationship turned sour. Her mother, Aurora, had become more controlling and possessive over the years, often meddling in Emma's personal life. Desperate to escape this suffocating relationship, Emma decided to marry Anxious, someone she barely knew. She thought that by marrying him, she could finally establish some boundaries and independence. Fact1: Emma marries Anxious to escape her mother. Despite Emma's seemingly impulsive marriage to Anxious, they managed to form a strong connection over time. They couldn't always be together, as Emma wanted to stay in close proximity to her children from her previous marriage. Consequently, their primary means of staying in touch was through telephone calls and texts. Fact2: The tie between Emma and Anxious keeps them in touch by telephone. Back at home, Aurora was left struggling with loneliness after Emma had moved out. No longer able to interfere in her daughter's life, Aurora sought a new distraction. As fate would have it, a whirlwind romance blossomed between her and her next-door neighbor, a charming widower named Garrett. Fact3: Lonely Aurora begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor. Sadly, Emma's temporary respite from her mother's watchful eye came to a screeching halt when she was diagnosed with a severe illness. Her condition required extensive treatment and hospitalization, which proved to be physically and emotionally draining for her. Aurora, despite her past behavior, stayed by Emma's side throughout her treatment, offering her support. Realizing the strain this situation placed on their new romance and Emma's need for her mother's support during this vulnerable time, Aurora and Garrett decided to put an end to their relationship. Fact4: Aurora stays by Emma's side through treatment and hospitalization and ends her relationship with Garrett. With Aurora often at the hospital supporting Emma, Garrett felt the urge to do something helpful. He began spending time with Emma's young children, who were struggling to cope with their mother's illness. Garrett's gentle and caring nature struck a chord with them, and they quickly developed a strong bond. As he grew closer to the children, Garrett couldn't help but feel a sense of love and responsibility for their well-being. Fact5: Garrett begins to bond with Emma's young children. As time went on, Emma's condition improved, and she was eventually released from the hospital. Throughout this trying period, her relationship with her mother had dramatically changed, fostered by Aurora's unwavering support. With her newfound appreciation for family, Emma decided to take her husband Anxious and her children on a long-overdue family vacation, seeking to create new memories for them all. Meanwhile, Aurora and Garrett, realizing that their love had never truly faded, decided to rekindle their romance, now grounded in a mature and deep understanding of what truly matters in life: the love and support of family. In weaving together the lives and tribulations of its characters, the story above follows the five key facts in their given order, while expanding upon them to create a broader, coherent, and engaging narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jerrica saw the guard as she snuck past. Who is she referring to?","output":"In this sentence, Jerrica is referring to a particular guard whom she encounters while attempting to sneak past. The guard is usually a person assigned to oversee the security or protection of a specific place, event, person or item. They are responsible for ensuring the safety and orderliness of the area under their watch and taking necessary measures to prevent unauthorized access or security threats. Here, Jerrica is either trying to covertly enter or bypass a secured area without being noticed by the guard. Since the guard has not been previously mentioned, readers cannot determine their exact identity or significance without more context. It could be a security guard at a facility, a personal bodyguard, or even a police officer or military personnel guarding a sensitive location. Further information about Jerrica's intentions and the setting is required to understand the relationship between the two characters and the implications of her actions. The presence of the guard introduces an element of tension and risk in the narrative. Jerrica's stealthy movement suggests that she might be involved in a clandestine activity or mission where being detected could lead to adverse consequences. Additionally, the fact that she saw the guard implies that she needs to be extra cautious to avoid raising any suspicion. In summary, Jerrica, who is trying to sneak past unnoticed, is referring to a guard responsible for overseeing the security of a specific area. The guard's identity, role, and connection to the story are unclear without further context, but the reference to the guard introduces an element of risk and tension to the narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - eukaryotes  - protists  - scavangers  - prokaryotes  A: A:","output":"Prokaryotes help convert some molecules to forms that can be taken up by other organisms. Step 1: Identify the role of each choice in the ecosystem. - Eukaryotes: Organisms with complex cells, including plants, animals, and fungi. - Protists: Single-celled eukaryotes, such as algae and protozoa. - Scavengers: Organisms that feed on dead plants and animals. - Prokaryotes: Single-celled organisms without a nucleus, such as bacteria and archaea. Step 2: Consider the processes that involve molecular conversion. - Prokaryotes, especially bacteria, are well-known for their role in decomposing dead organic matter and recycling nutrients in the ecosystem. They break down complex organic molecules into simpler forms, making them available for uptake by other organisms. Step 3: Evaluate which choice is most directly involved in molecular conversion. - Eukaryotes and protists can play roles in nutrient cycling, but they do not primarily convert molecules for uptake by other organisms. - Scavengers contribute to the decomposition process, but they mainly consume larger pieces of dead organisms rather than converting molecules for uptake by others. - Prokaryotes, specifically bacteria, are the primary transformers of molecules in the ecosystem, participating in processes like nitrogen fixation, carbon cycling, and decomposition. Conclusion: Prokaryotes are the most significant factor in converting molecules to forms that can be taken up by other organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  and the situation: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower.  Answer the following question: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","output":"The particles would move faster in object A than in object B.  The justification for this answer comes directly from the background given. According to the physics definition of temperature, temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. Kinetic energy relates to the motion of the particles. Higher kinetic energy implies more motion, or faster moving particles. Given that object A has a higher temperature than object B, this means that on average, the particles in object A have more kinetic energy than those in object B. More kinetic energy translates to faster movement. Hence, the particles are moving faster in object A than in object B. This increased movement is what makes object A feel warmer to the touch, as stated in the background."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Anju  for the following movie plot:  A grotesque brougham stops in a dark forest and its cowled driver, Lalbai the sorceress, beckons to the bewitched passenger, a newly wed bride. Lalbai leads the bride to the shaitani ilaaka (devil's domain) where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka (the Shaitan, or great devil). Shaitan is an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the shaitani ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. At the affluent home of rich industrialist Thakur, he has a wife, Roma, and their six-year old daughter, Anju. They have retained a governess, Shalaka, for Anju. Anju seems to be a happy child with one exception. She experiences strange convulsions and horrible nightmares every Amavasya night. Thakur decides to bring her to Dr. Yograj, a medical man who has attained Siddhi through rigorous spiritual training. Dr. Yograj examines Anju from a medical standpoint, but also notices strange telekinetic events when Anju is in his office. Later, at the home, he observes phenomena that strongly indicate a poltergeist. When he talks to Shalaka, she firmly snubs him. (Unbeknownst to the family however, Shalaka practices voodoo with Anju as the target.) Dr. Yograj refers Thakur to a famed Tantrik Baba (wise man), recently returned from Tibet after an extended spiritual course, for help. Baba visits the home, inspects Anju's room, and immediately identifies it as the work of a malevolent aatma (soul).

Answer:","output":"Leopold II of Belgium was born on April 9, 1835, in Brussels, Belgium, into the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was the son of Leopold I of Belgium and Louise of Orléans. As a Roman Catholic, he would grow up to become an influential figure in the history of Belgium. Leopold II ascended to the throne in 1865 after the death of his father and predecessor, Leopold I, and ruled as King of the Belgians until his death on December 17, 1909. In addition to his reign over Belgium, Leopold II also exercised control over the Congo Free State, which he ruled as sovereign from July 1, 1885, to November 15, 1908. Throughout his reign, he implemented policies aimed at benefiting both Belgium and the Congo, though his administration of the latter sparked considerable controversy. Leopold II's rule was succeeded by Albert I, who continued to shape Belgian history in the years that followed. The late king was married to Marie Henriette of Austria, and together, they had four children: Princess Stéphanie, who would become the Crown Princess of Austria; Princess Clémentine, who married Prince Napoléon of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; Prince Leopold, the Duke of Brabant; and Louise, a princess in her own right.

Premise: \\"It's a deal as far as I'm concerned.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It's a deal according to his boss.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"It's a deal as far as I'm concerned,\\" we do not have enough information to determine if the hypothesis, \\"It's a deal according to his boss,\\" is true.  In the premise itself, it is clear that the speaker (the one concerned) is satisfied or agrees with the \\"deal,\\" which could represent a negotiation, agreement, or arrangement struck with another person or party. However, the speaker's opinion or agreement might not be enough to conclude anything about the opinion of the person's boss. To determine if the hypothesis is true or not, more information is required. Here are some possible scenarios that can help illustrate the limitations in reaching a conclusion based on only the given premise: 1. If the speaker is the boss: In this scenario, if the speaker making the statement is actually the boss, then the hypothesis would be true. The deal satisfies the boss, and this would be evident in his statement. 2. If the speaker is not the boss but has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the boss: In this case, if the speaker has the authority to represent the boss and make decisions for them, the hypothesis might be considered true. By agreeing to the deal, the speaker might essentially convey the boss' agreement as well. 3. If the speaker is not the boss and does not have the authority to make decisions: In this situation, the speaker's agreement with the deal does not necessarily imply the boss's agreement. The hypothesis in this case cannot be assumed as true. The boss might have different opinions or criteria to evaluate the deal, and thus, their views might vary. 4. If the speaker is not aware of the boss's opinion: If the speaker has no knowledge regarding the boss's opinion or awareness about the existence of the deal, we cannot conclude anything about the hypothesis. The boss's views might be aligned or contradictory to the speaker's views, and we would need more information to determine the boss's stance on the said deal. In summary, based on the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis \\"It's a deal according to his boss\\" is true or not. Further information about the relationship between the speaker and the boss, the speaker's authority level, or the boss's opinion on the deal, will be required to draw a more coherent conclusion regarding the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Janoskians play dirty with boy-band template at Paradise The members of the Australian quintet the Janoskians — brothers Beau, Jai, and Luke Brooks, and friends Daniel “Skip” Sahyounie and James Yammouni — officially state that they aren’t a boy band. While this is technically true, the young group’s tattooed, pierced bad-dude posturing fills a space crucial to the teen-idol ecosystem, and the raucous, oak tag-brandishing crowd at their show at the Paradise on Monday signaled their success. The Janoskians came to prominence on YouTube, posting comedy clips that thrive to some extent on online video’s tendencies toward celebrating mild sociopathy — “Awkward Train Situations,” their first offering, was a montage of them annoying fellow passengers in a way that brought to mind a youthful, innuendo-eschewing Candid Camera. A steady stream of videos, constant updates on social media outposts like Keek and Instagram, savvy cross-merchandising via their Dirty Pig clothing line, teen magazine-ready looks, and outrage stoked by some of their randier stunts eventually — inevitably? — resulted in the Janoskians garnering attention from big-name entertainment concerns. Lionsgate signed the group to a film deal this spring; Republic Records has released their singles in the US. While the Janoskians might not consider themselves a boy band, show business is slow when it comes to developing new pipelines for stars, and the Janoskians’ material being a bit too blue for teen TV outlets means that their brand-building will be filled with lip synching and synchronized moves — at least until the movie comes out. Monday night’s show made it obvious that the group needed to work out the kinks of live performance; the miming and dancing felt tossed-off, like a trial the fivesome had to endure in order to be rewarded with the crowd’s love. (A spirited performance of “Let It Go,” the diva statement from “Frozen,” proved the exception.) The skits included a quiz show where wrong answers led to members getting electrocuted and the acting out of a piece of fan fiction that climaxed in screech-inducing clinches. Passing the mike to the crowd for a Q&A led to queries about sex posed so frankly that even the group seemed flustered. The crowd, for its part, wasn’t bothered by anything, whether half-hearted lip synching or overreliance on bodily function gags — perhaps partly because screams drowned out laugh lines. When those did come through, it was hard to not wish for a smidge of meddling from a standards-and-practices department: The guys have a not-insignificant amount of charm, but it’s lost in the morass of dime-store gags. Take the speed-dating-themed video for “Real Girls Eat Cake,” a ska-skewing track that could be the cheeky-dude counterpart to Megan Trainor’s chart-topping ode to butts, “All About That Bass.” The clip indulges more cheap stereotypes than a Katy Perry awards-show performance, while the lyrics embody the pick-up artist ideal of the “neg,” in which one wins the affections of potential suitors by not-so-subtly putting them down. It’s a bit of a drag, although the quintet’s stated unwillingness to play to teen-idol type means that they have to play fast and loose with ideals of “good behavior.” But if the Janoskians want to transcend YouTube, they need to aim their jokes both higher and more precisely. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Janoskians, an Australian group of friends, gained fame on YouTube with their comedy videos and now have a film deal and music singles.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Australia (continent). Yes or no? Answer: During the past ten thousand years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. Question: what continent is australia The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the continent in question is Australia. The continent of Australia is the smallest of the seven continents, and it comprises the Australian mainland, the island of Tasmania, and the smaller islands surrounding it. Australia, as a continent, is part of the region known as Oceania, which also includes the islands of the Pacific Ocean. The statement provided accurately describes the geographical and geological changes that have occurred in the Australian continent over the past ten thousand years. Rising sea levels caused by the melting of ice caps and glaciers have resulted in the inundation of lowland areas, thus separating the mainland of Australia from the islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. Australia's geographical history has greatly influenced its unique flora and fauna, which have evolved in isolation from the rest of the world. The continent is known for its vast array of marsupials, such as kangaroos and koalas, and monotremes, such as the platypus and the echidna, along with a diverse range of bird species, reptiles, and plant life. The mainland of Australia is characterized by its arid to semi-arid climate, numerous deserts, and unique landforms such as Uluru and the Great Sandy Desert. Meanwhile, the island of Tasmania boasts a more temperate climate and a rich, mountainous landscape that supports a diverse range of ecosystems. In summary, the continent of Australia consists of the Australian mainland, Tasmania, and several smaller islands. Its geographical history has been shaped by rising sea levels, which have separated the mainland from neighboring islands like New Guinea and Tasmania, resulting in a unique array of flora and fauna not found elsewhere on the planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Joseph Frank \\"Buster\\" Keaton (October 4, 1895 - February 1, 1966) was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer. He was best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic, deadpan expression, earning him the nickname \\"The Great Stone Face\\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \\"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies\\". His career declined afterward with a dispiriting loss of his artistic independence when he was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and he descended into alcoholism, ruining his family life. Keaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Throughout the 1940s, Keaton played character roles in both \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" features. He made his last starring feature El Moderno Barba Azul (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title Boom in the Moon. Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger \\"prestige\\" pictures. He had cameos in such films as In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Around the World in 80 Days (1956). In In The Good Old Summertime, Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress.  Keaton also had a cameo as Jimmy, appearing near the end of the film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). Jimmy assists Spencer Tracy's character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately-unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a restored scene where Jimmy and Culpeper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic's \\"roadshow\\" exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered, and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.) Keaton was given more screen time in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966). The appearance, since it was released after his death, was his posthumous swansong.  Keaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952), recalling the vaudeville of The Playhouse. With the exception of Seeing Stars, a minor publicity film produced in 1922, Limelight was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film.  In 1949, comedian Ed Wynn invited Keaton to appear on his CBS Television comedy-variety show, The Ed Wynn Show, which was televised live on the West Coast. Kinescopes were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country since there was no transcontinental coaxial cable until September 1951. Great. What else?","output":"Besides his film appearances, Buster Keaton also made a significant impact on the small screen with several appearances on television, and continued to work on stage throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1950, he hosted and co-starred in the television show \\"The Buster Keaton Show,\\" which only lasted one season due to fractious relationships between Keaton and the executive producers. However, this did not deter him from pursuing other television opportunities. Keaton made guest appearances on several popular television shows, such as \\"The Ed Wynn Show,\\" \\"The Garry Moore Show,\\" \\"What's My Line?\\", \\"Candid Camera,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" and \\"The Donna Reed Show.\\" Remarkably, the comedian had a recurring role as a time-traveling train conductor on the children's show \\"The Adventures of Hiram Holliday\\" in the late 1950s, showcasing his ability to adapt to different audiences. As television became an increasingly vital medium for entertainment, Keaton embraced the opportunities it presented to comedians such as himself. In the early 1960s, Keaton starred in a series of industrial films to promote the benefits of using aluminum, produced by the Alcoa Company. These shorts, known as \\"The Homeowner,\\" \\"The Boat Builder,\\" and \\"The Blacksmith,\\" allowed him to employ his trademark physical comedy style while teaching viewers about the many uses of aluminum materials. Furthermore, Keaton's legacy on stage continued with his noteworthy performance in the 1955 stage play \\"Once Upon a Mattress.\\" He then went on to tour with the play in 1960, visiting various cities and giving audiences an opportunity to witness his timeless talent on stage. Keaton also ventured into the field of advertisement. In a series of commercials for Simon Pure Beer, he reprised a few of his iconic silent comedy routines to promote the beverage. These commercials served as an additional platform for reintroducing his comedy to a new generation of viewers. In January 1966, shortly before his death, Keaton was presented with an honorary Oscar \\"for his unique talents which brought immortal comedies to the screen.\\" Despite facing numerous personal struggles, professional setbacks, and the daunting challenges of working in a constantly changing entertainment landscape, Buster Keaton left an indelible mark on the film, television, and theatrical worlds. Buster Keaton's influence can be seen today in the works of various comedians, filmmakers, and actors, who continue to draw inspiration from his innovative approach to physical comedy, deadpan expression, and determination to push the boundaries of what was possible on screen. Keaton's life and work serve as a testament to his enduring impact on the world of entertainment and as a reminder of the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He writes: \\"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of \\"proof\\" according the Quran being \\"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \\"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\\" which inhibit a \\"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\\" of the Quran's message.

This question requires students to engage deeply with the passage and understand the various perspectives presented by the mentioned scholars. Specifically, students will need to: 1. Identify the significance of knowledge and evidence in the Quran as depicted by Nidhal Guessoum. It is crucial for them to recognize the Quran's disapproval of conjecturing without evidence (17:36) and its demand for proofs in theological belief and natural science (2:111). 2.

In Sentence 1, it is stated that \\"The unpredictable consonant of every word was then dropped, the distribution of first leaving.\\" In this sentence, the emphasis is on dropping the unpredictable consonant from every word. As such, the focus here is on the unpredictability of the consonant being removed from the words. Additionally, this sentence implies that there is a distribution of firsts that are left after the unpredictable consonants are dropped. It is not clear what \\"first\\" refers to in this context, so the meaning of this phrase is quite vague. In Sentence 2, the statement is \\"The first consonant of each word was then dropped, leaving the distribution of unpredictable.\\" Here, the primary detail is that the first consonant of each word is removed. Unlike in Sentence 1, this sentence explicitly states that the first consonant is dropped and reveals what remains as \\"the distribution of unpredictable.\\" While still somewhat ambiguous, it seems that the focus here is on the unpredictable nature of the remaining distribution after dropping the first consonant, possibly referring to the unpredictable nature of the words or elements left in the text. In summary, these two sentences do not convey the same information. Sentence 1 focuses on dropping the unpredictable consonant of every word and has a vague reference to a distribution of firsts.

Premise: The cut in output and employment in the investment sector would not be immediately offset by a rise in output and employment in industries that produce for export or that compete with imports. Hypothesis: Companies often lay off employees to save money on expenses. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is essential to first understand both the premise and the hypothesis thoroughly and analyze how the hypothesis is connected to the premise. Let's break down both statements before evaluating the entailment. Premise: The premise describes a situation in which a cut in output and employment in the investment sector would not be immediately offset by a rise in output and employment in industries that produce for export or that compete with imports. In simpler terms, the premise is stating that when employment and production are reduced in one sector (in this case, the investment sector), there won't be an instant increase or adjustment in employment and production in other sectors (specifically, the export and import-competing industries). The premise implies that there's a lag or delay in the redistribution of resources (employment and production capacity) across different sectors of the economy. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that companies often lay off employees to save money on expenses. It suggests that letting go of employees is a common strategy employed by businesses to reduce their operational costs, which can be attributed to various reasons. The reasons can include financial struggles, organizational restructuring, or adapting to market changes. The hypothesis, as a standalone statement, doesn't specifically mention any sector or type of industry. Entailment evaluation: The hypothesis focuses on a general behavior of companies, implying that layoffs can happen across different sectors or industries as a measure to save money. On the other hand, the premise outlines a specific scenario where there is a decrease in employment and output in the investment sector without an immediate balancing effect on industries related to export or competing with imports. Even though both statements talk about employment reduction, the premise does not provide explicit reasons behind the cut in employment and output, and it is focused on a particular inter-sector scenario. Considering this, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. The premise creates a scenario without providing reasons or causes that lead to employment cuts. Therefore, it is not a logical consequence of the premise that companies lay off their employees to save money on expenses simply because there is no immediate equilibrium in employment and output in export or import-competing industries following a cut in the investment sector."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.  - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed.  - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian:  a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918.  - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.    What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'ubavoj nam crnoj gori'?

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but disappears moments later, and wakes up back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield during World War I, is shot in the leg, and then is suddenly transported to 1996. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who is shot in the leg is James Cole. He is shot in the leg when he arrives at a battlefield during World War I, before being suddenly transported to 1996 to complete his mission of finding the original virus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Waite, 85, who played... (Associated Press)      Waite, who lived in the Palm Springs area, died at midday, manager Alan Mills said. Mills, who did not know the cause of death, said he was taken aback because Waite had been in good health and still working.      Waite appeared last year in episodes of the series \\"NCIS,\\" in which he played the dad of star Mark Harmon's character. He also appeared in \\"Bones\\" and \\"Days of Our Lives.\\"      \\"The Waltons,\\" which aired on CBS from 1972 to 1981, starred Waite as John Walton, and Richard Thomas played his oldest son, John-Boy, an aspiring novelist. The gentle family drama was set in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia.      His co-stars on Thursday praised both the actor and the man.      \\"I am devastated to announce the loss of my precious 'papa' Walton, Ralph Waite,\\" said Mary McDonough, who played daughter Erin Walton. \\"I loved him so much; I know he was so special to all of us. He was like a real father to me. Goodnight Daddy. I love you.\\"      Michael Learned, who played wife Olivia Walton, said she was \\"devastated\\" by the death of \\"a good honest actor and a good honest man.\\"      \\"He was my spiritual husband,\\" Learned said in a statement. \\"We loved each other for over forty years. He died a working actor at the top of his game. He was a loving mentor to many and a role model to an entire generation.\\"      The show, which followed the Waltons' triumphs and setbacks through the Great Depression and World War II, was narrated by its rich-voiced creator, Earl Hamner Jr., who based it on his family memories.      It was a TV rarity, a respectful depiction of Southern country life, and proved so popular that it overpowered its hit comedy competition, NBC's \\"The Flip Wilson Show.\\"      Waite, a native of White Plains, N.Y., served in the U.S. Marines before earning a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University and a master's degree from Yale University Divinity School, according to a 2010 profile by The Desert Sun.      He became an ordained Presbyterian minister and then worked at a publishing house, the paper said, before falling under the spell of acting. Waite appeared on the stage before moving onto the big screen with roles in 1967's \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" and 1970's \\"Five Easy Pieces,\\" in which he played the brother of Jack Nicholson's character.      Waite received an Emmy nomination for \\"The Waltons\\" and another for his performance in the ABC miniseries \\"Roots.\\"      Waite's role as a steady TV dad in the CBS drama was in contrast to his personal life that was undercut by alcoholism, Waite told The Desert Sun.      \\"I was a caring, responsible father to all of these kids. But I was drinking the night before and being a drunk on the side,\\" he said, adding, \\"I found a way to get sober.\\"      In 1990, Waite ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic challenger to a four-term Republican incumbent for the congressional district that included Riverside, Palm Springs and Palm Desert, where Waite lived.      In 1998, he vied for the congressional seat left open after Republican Sony Bono, another performer who turned to politics, died in a skiing accident. Bono's widow, Mary, won the special election. ||||| UPDATED: He was nominated for an Emmy in 1978 for his portrayal of the middle-American paterfamilias.      Ralph Waite, who was beloved to TV viewers as the ultimate father figure, John Walton, on The Waltons, has died. He passed away at midday on Thursday at his home in South Palm Desert, Steve Gordon, the accountant for the Waite family, told The Hollywood Reporter.      He was nominated for an Emmy in 1978 for his portrayal of the middle-American paterfamilias. He starred on The Waltons for nine years and directed 15 episodes. \\"Ralph was a good honest actor and a good honest man,\\" said actress Michael Learned, who portrayed Waite's wife Olivia on The Waltons. \\"He was my spiritual husband. We loved each other for over forty years. He died a working actor at the top of his game. He was a loving mentor to many and a role model to an entire generation. I'm devastated.\\"      Prior to landing his role on The Waltons, Waite had been in only one other TV show, a Nichols episode. Waite also performed in the vaunted miniseries Roots, for which he received a 1977 Emmy nomination.      PHOTOS: Ralph Waite's Career in Pictures            More recently, he appeared in Days of Our Lives and had a recurring role as Rev. Norman Balthus on HBO's Carnivale, a part befitting a man who once served as an ordained minister on Long Island. He also appeared as Jackson Gibbs in NCIS over the course of several seasons and as Hank Booth in Bones.            Waite was the founder and director of the Los Angeles Actors Theatre, which he established in 1975. To get the company off the ground, Waite allocated 50,000 of his own money to produce and direct revivals of The Hairy Ape and The Kitchen, in which he also performed.            LAAT won many critical awards, including the Margaret Harford Award given by the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle for \\"its consistently high standards, its commitment to adventurous theater and to community involvement.\\"            A former social worker and a recovering alcoholic, Waite channeled that background into a film on the lives of people on L.A.'s skid row, On the Nickel, which he produced, directed, wrote and starred in. Under his own production banner, Ralph Waite Productions, he starred as a criminal lawyer in the 1983 TV series The Mississippi. TV movies credits include the titular role in The Secret Life of John Chapman, OHMS, Angel City and The Gentleman Bandit.            Politically active, he twice ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat, including a run for the seat left vacant by the late Sonny Bono in 1998.            Ralph Waite was born June 22, 1928, in White Plains, N.Y., and graduated from Bucknell University. He later studied for three years at Yale and earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree. At that juncture, he went on to have stints as a social worker for the Westchester County Department of Welfare, as well as publicity director and associate editor at Harper & Row. He was a minister at the United Church of Christ in Garden City, Long Island.            \\"He was a top-notch minister and a dynamic actor in the pulpit even then,\\" former parishioner and actor Bill Hayes told TV Guide in 1975. \\"But I don't think Ralph ever enjoyed being asked to conform to the mold or the stereotype expected of most clergymen. He was disturbed by people telling him to straighten his tie or shine his shoes or fix the hole in his sock. He was a very individualistic guy who wanted to be himself.\\"      STORY: Hollywood Remembers Ralph Waite            It was during his ministerial tenure that Waite traveled to his own Damascus, a night he spent with Hayes at an acting class. At age 32, Waite left the ministry to pursue acting.            His conversion from the church to the stage was immediately successful. In 1960, Waite got his first stage role in a Broadway production of Blues for Mister Charlie. In his first eight years of acting, he landed appearances in eight Broadway plays, including Hogan's Goat, Watering Place and The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. He also performed Blues for Mister Charlie in London.            As his stage career gathered steam, Waite also garnered small roles in top films: Cool Hand Luke and Five Easy Pieces. In 1969, he featured in coming-of-age saga Last Summer, which starred an up-and-coming Richard Thomas.            His other films include Lawman, The Grissom Gang, Dime Box and Sporting Club.            He had two daughters, Kathleen and Suzanne. Since 1984, he has been married to his third wife, Linda East.

Please answer the following question: John was reading about a fascinating story of a scientist in a science fiction book. In that novel the scientist met with a mysterious wormhole while visiting Antarctica. First, the wormhole started the time travel in present day, which was designated as point A. Then it sent the scientist to 170 million years in the past, which was designated as point B. The scientist had the rare experience of visiting Antarctica in two different time periods, 170 million years apart.  Which point would see less ice sheets, point A or point B? A:","output":"To determine which point would see less ice sheets, let's consider the differences in Antarctica's environment during those two time periods. Point A (Present Day): In the present day, Antarctica is known for being the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth, with approximately 98% of its surface covered by ice. Although recent research has shown that ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate due to climate change, there still remains a significant amount of ice in Antarctica. Point B (170 Million Years Ago): During this time, Earth was in the middle of the Jurassic period. The climate during the Jurassic period was generally warmer and more humid than it is today, with higher levels of CO2. Antarctica would have been located farther north than it is now, due to the movement of tectonic plates. Considering these differences, it is likely that there would be less ice sheets in Antarctica during Point B (170 million years ago) compared to Point A (present day), due to a warmer and more humid climate and a more northerly location on the Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him.

Please answer the following question: Background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Paragraph: Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago. His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which colleague studied that more people settled down in villages? A:","output":"Given the information provided, it is Phil who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, which coincides with the period when human beings started inventing agriculture. As stated in the background information, it is this period of time (approximately 10,000 years ago) when humans for the first time began to form settled societies, establishing villages and cities. This means that Phil, who was studying this timeframe, would also be studying the time when a larger number of people started to settle down in villages - as opposed to the relatively nomadic lifestyle that characterized humanity's earlier existence. Furthermore, Phil's research would also encompass the lifestyle changes consequent of this agricultural revolution, including higher birth rates due to increased food supplies, and higher death rates due to disease transmission from close living quarters and domestic animals. Brad, on the other hand, who studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago, was looking into a period far earlier than the advent of agriculture and settled city life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph :  In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles.  Question:   If a stream begins moving faster, what will happen to the size of the particles it carries get bigger or get smaller? Answer:","output":"If a stream begins moving faster, the size of the particles it carries will likely get bigger. This can be deduced from the information given in the paragraph, which states that a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. As the stream's speed increases, it will have more energy available for transporting larger and heavier particles. Therefore, fast-moving streams are capable of carrying larger sediments and even small rocks. When the speed of the stream increases, its erosive capacity also increases. With a higher energy level due to the faster movement, the stream will now be able to move larger and heavier particles, as well as transport them over longer distances. This is mainly because the higher kinetic energy in the water flow can overcome the gravitational forces that tend to keep larger particles on the bed of the stream. In addition, the increase in water velocity can also affect the process known as suspension, wherein particles are temporarily lifted off the stream bed and carried along by the water flow. This results in an increased ability for the stream to hold and transport even larger particles until the velocity of the water decreases. Overall, when a stream begins moving faster, its capacity to carry particles of bigger sizes increases, thus allowing it to erode and transport larger sediments along its course."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ferris Aircraft Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Flight of the Emerald Defenders\\" Step 1: Establishing the Setting and Main Character - The movie is set in Coast City, the home to Ferris Aircraft, where test pilot Hal Jordan is employed. Characters: Hal Jordan (the protagonist), Carol Ferris (Hal's love interest and daughter of the company's owner), and the rest of Hal's co-workers at Ferris Aircraft. Step 2: Inciting Incident - During a routine test flight, Hal Jordan encounters a strange but powerful energy force that crashes into a nearby forest. He goes to investigate and discovers a dying alien named Abin Sur, who has crash-landed on Earth. Step 3: Key Plot Point - The alien, Abin Sur, reveals himself to be a member of a powerful intergalactic force known as the Green Lantern Corps. Before passing away, he tells Hal that the energy force he encountered was a Green Lantern Power Ring, which has now chosen him as a new member of the Green Lantern Corps. Step 4: Introduction of Antagonist - A skilled saboteur named Hector Hammond has been hired by a rival corporation to bring down Ferris Aircraft. When he learns about the Power Ring and its capabilities, he becomes obsessed with acquiring it for himself in order to become the most powerful man on Earth. Step 5: Rising Action - As Hal Jordan trains to become a Green Lantern, learning to harness the power of the ring, he struggles to keep Hector Hammond and his plans to destroy Ferris Aircraft at bay. Hal must also face his feelings for Carol, who remains unaware of his new heroic alter ego. Step 6: Climax - Hal learns from the Green Lantern Corps that a powerful cosmic entity known as Parallax is responsible for Abin Sur's death and is now coming to Earth, attracted by the Power Ring's energy. Simultaneously, Hector Hammond manages to sabotage a major Ferris Aircraft project, which could lead to the company's downfall. Step 7: Showdown - Hal, as Green Lantern, must stop Hector Hammond and save Ferris Aircraft, while also preventing the arrival of Parallax on Earth. The showdown takes place both at Ferris Aircraft (between Hal and Hector) and in outer space, as Green Lantern engages in a battle with Parallax. Step 8: Resolution - Hal Jordan, with the help of the Green Lantern Corps, defeats Parallax and saves Earth from destruction. He also manages to expose Hector Hammond's sabotage, saving Ferris Aircraft and protecting the company's future. Carol discovers that Hal is Green Lantern and they confess their love for each other, although Hal's responsibilities as a Green Lantern will require him to constantly balance his personal life with his duties as a protector of the universe. Step 9: Closing - The movie ends with Hal Jordan confidently taking his place as a member of the Green Lantern Corps, embracing his role as Earth's protector and flying off into space, ready for his next adventure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: His comments came after a night-time meeting with President Thein Sein. Mr Obama had earlier met Burmese lawmakers, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In an interview published on Wednesday, he had accused the government of backsliding on reforms. The US president is in the capital Nay Pyi Taw for the East Asia summit. Following the hour-long meeting with President Sein, he said that \\"the democratic process in Myanmar is real\\". \\"We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic,\\" he added. President Thein Sein, a former general, said the talks had been candid, according to the Associated Press news agency. In 2010, Myanmar held elections which replaced military rule with the military-backed civilian government of Thein Sein. Since then, many political prisoners have been released, media restrictions have eased and Ms Suu Kyi has been released from years of house arrest. Amid the reforms, her National League for Democracy rejoined the political process and secured a small block of seats in parliament after a landslide win in by-elections in 2012. But Ms Suu Kyi - who is currently banned by a constitutional clause from becoming the nation's president - has recently warned that reforms have stalled, as all eyes turn to 2015 when the next general election will be held. Discussing his earlier meeting with Burmese parliamentarians, Mr Obama said they had talked about Myanmar's transition from military rule to democracy. Among the issues discussed were the protection of minority rights and how majority and opposition parties could work together, he said. \\"The work is not yet done, and the goal of the United States here is to be a strong partner in the process. \\"But our consistent aim and goal will be to see that this transition is completed so that it delivers concrete benefits for the people.\\" Mr Obama was due to meet Ms Suu Kyi again in Yangon on Friday. So did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge. Ms Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged. Drafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution. This is what its architects proudly call a \\"disciplined democracy\\". Has Myanmar's reform journey ground to a halt? In an interview with a Thai-based Burmese website ahead of his arrival, Mr Obama said reform momentum had slowed in Myanmar and that there had even been some steps backwards. He cited restrictions on political prisoners, the arrest of journalists and the ongoing plight of the Rohingya Muslim minority displaced in Rakhine state after anti-Muslim violence. \\"Even as there has been some progress on the political and economic fronts, in other areas there has been a slowdown and backsliding in reforms,\\" he said. This is Mr Obama's second visit to Myanmar. He last came in November 2012, in what was the first visit to the nation by a US president. Mr Obama's meeting with Thein Sein took place on the sidelines of the East Asia summit - which groups the Asean bloc with the US, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Russia and New Zealand. On Wednesday Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations) held its own meeting in the Burmese capital.","output":"During the East Asia Summit in Nay Pyi Taw, President Obama met with Myanmar's President Thein Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to discuss the country's ongoing democratic transition. Although he acknowledged the difficulties in the process, Obama expressed optimism about the progress made so far. Since moving away from military rule in 2010, Myanmar has released political prisoners, relaxed media restrictions, and allowed Ms. Suu Kyi's party to rejoin the political process. However, challenges remain, such as constitutional changes that maintain the military's control over the government. Obama also mentioned areas in which reform progress has slowed or regressed, including political prisoner restrictions, journalist arrests, and issues surrounding the Rohingya Muslim minority."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents  who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders  rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, respectively. California also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  California's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east; and from the redwood–Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. Though California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate, the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north, to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.  What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California then was organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850.

Question: \\"Styli made of sapphire and osmium alloy replaced those made from what?\\"  Context: \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Styli made of sapphire and osmium alloy replaced those made from steel.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Macro analysis has its basis in the large (Macro) tendencies observed in the economy. Your goal is to understand how major forces are affecting the performance of the economy. Then, base your investment decisions on your findings. For example, if the economy is performing poorly (inflation and unemployment are high while national output is low), avoid overpaying for stocks and be sure to diversify your stocks. The most important macro indicators include: GDP (gross domestic product), CPI (consumer price indices), PPI (producer price indices), unemployment rate, interest rates (Fed Funds, prime rate, etc.), inflation rate, and balance of trade. You can either download the historical data to Excel or access an interactive graph using online tools. Go to the websites of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (http://www.bea.gov/) or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/) to access the data. Look for the general direction that the numbers are moving in and any patterns that may emerge. Take into account: the historical data you found, current data, and news. The website will have a separate series of data already converted to percent for either Year over Year or Quarter over Quarter. If not, you can determine the percentage of change for an indicator. For example, divide the nominal GDP (in numbers) of one year by the value from the previous year. This gives you the GDP growth percentage for Year over Year. Investing in a broad based stock or stock alternative might be the most convenient with this method of analysis. Select a group of stocks that reflect the movement of the broader economy and track an index like the Dow Jones Industrial average or S&P 500. This approach allows you to enjoy the growth of stocks in the US in general without risking all your money on one or just a few stocks. Understand that macro analysis doesn't specifically help you decide which individual stocks to buy. Instead, it simply lets you understand the performance of the economy. For example, you may want to buy stocks when you think the economy will improve and sell when you think it will deteriorate. Summary:","output":"Macro analysis involves understanding the impact of major economic forces, such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment, on investment decisions; utilizing data from sources like the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics, this approach helps investors determine optimal market conditions for investing in broad-based stocks and indices without focusing on individual stock selection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What type of magic do the Vagyu clan practice? Black magic The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters First, we need to establish the setting for our movie plot. Let's choose a small, secluded village surrounded by dense forests as our primary location. The residents of this village have lived there for centuries, keeping their traditions and beliefs intact. Among them, the Vagyu clan is a mysterious and feared community known for practicing black magic. Our main character, Alex, is an outsider who moves to the village to start a new life after going through a personal tragedy. Unaware of the Vagyu clan's existence and their dark arts, Alex befriends another villager, Sara, who shares stories and warnings about the Vagyu clan. Step 2: Introduce the conflict The movie plot thickens as the village experiences a series of mysterious events, from unexplained sicknesses to terrible accidents. Suspicion falls upon the Vagyu clan as the village starts to believe that they're responsible for the misfortunes, using their black magic to maintain control and fear. Alex, driven by curiosity and a desire to expose the truth, decides to investigate the Vagyu clan further. With Sara's help, they gather information and uncover secrets about the clan's dark rituals. Step 3: Raise the stakes As Alex and Sara delve deeper into the Vagyu clan's activities, they start to become the targets of the clan's wrath. Paranormal events start occurring around them, and they feel an ominous presence following their every move. Despite the dangers, Alex and Sara resolve to confront the Vagyu clan and put an end to their dark practices once and for all. However, they're met with resistance not only from the clan but also from some villagers who are afraid of the repercussions of challenging the Vagyu. Step 4: Climax and resolution In the climax, Alex and Sara discover the Vagyu clan's hidden lair where they perform their rituals. They manage to interrupt a significant ritual, causing a massive display of dark energies that wreak havoc on the village. The Vagyu clan's leader, infuriated by Alex and Sara's interference, vows to use the full extent of their black magic to make them suffer. In the heat of the moment, Sara reveals her hidden knowledge of white magic and engages in a fierce magical battle with the Vagyu leader. While the duel rages, Alex works to undo the dark spells cast on the village, resulting in a gradual lift of the curse plaguing the community. Finally, Sara defeats the Vagyu leader, and the clan's power wanes. The villagers, now free from fear, work together to rebuild their community and shun the darkness that once loomed over them. Step 5: End the movie plot on a hopeful note The movie closes with Alex deciding to remain in the village, having found a sense of purpose and belonging. Alex's bond with Sara strengthens as they continue to use their knowledge of magic to help the community. Together, they ensure that the village remains protected from any future dark forces. Thus, the answer to the question, \\"What type of magic do the Vagyu clan practice?\\" is black magic, which is central to the conflict and resolution of the movie plot."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’m not being sarcastic. In April 2010, it was recorded in Hansard that ‘this House expresses profound sadness at the death of Corin Redgrave [and] recalls his life as a brilliant actor, peace campaigner, supporter of the downtrodden and man of enormous principle’. Yet Redgrave, a stalwart of the Workers’ Revolutionary Party, had devoted much of his life to the overthrow of parliamentary democracy and our wicked capitalist ways. Committed to the economic and political theories of Lenin and Trotsky, he saw money and materialism as the root cause of ‘inequality, social conflict and wars’. Mention Thatcher to him and he went blue in the face. Corin fell in love with his second wife, Kika Markham, during a lecture at the Derbyshire College of Marxist Education. Corin fell in love with his second wife, Kika Markham, during a lecture at the Derbyshire College of Marxist Education. They spent their honeymoon thinking up ways of ‘fighting Thatcher, unemployment and racism’. As an actor, Corin developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence. His one-man show about Oscar Wilde was acclaimed in London and New York. I myself witnessed him play Sir Anthony Blunt, the Soviet double-agent, in a one-man show presented in Bromyard, Herefordshire, the town in which Corin and his sister, Vanessa, had spent the war as evacuees. Such was his magnetism that, at the end, he had us all lustily singing The Red Flag. As an actor, Corin developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence. His one-man show about Oscar Wilde was acclaimed in London and New York. He had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father, Sir Michael Redgrave. As a performer, Corin had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father, Sir Michael Redgrave. I was slightly disconcerted to discover in Our Time Of Day, however, that, when Sir Michael died and was cremated in 1985, Corin ever afterwards kept the ashes in his car, ‘unable to part with them’. Strange behaviour. As a chain-smoker and alcoholic, Corin was asking for trouble and, in 2005, recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in Italy, ‘he was shivering and shaking like a leaf’, says Kika. The emergency doctor ‘couldn’t tell if it was very bad flu or whether it might have been a heart attack’. As a chain-smoker and alcoholic, Corin was asking for trouble and, in 2005, recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in Italy, ‘he was shivering and shaking like a leaf’, says Kika. Back in Britain, Corin was addressing a meeting of the Dale Farm gypsies in Basildon when he collapsed. He was taken, unconscious, to intensive care and put on a life-support machine. He had suffered ‘severe brain damage from the lack of oxygen after the cardiac arrest’. Would it have been a kindness had he died? The ensuing five years, which are recorded here in a completely engrossing and harrowing mix of diaries, memos, scraps, letters and heartbreaking reminiscence, were hell on Earth for Kika — because, when Corin regained consciousness, he had clean forgotten who she was. He was lucid, ‘articulate and passionate’, but his memory had been obliterated. Our Time Of Day is a horror story about a husband who wakes up and has no idea he’d ever been in love with his wife. Emotion and tenderness — all gone. ‘I can’t remember our life together,’ Corin confesses and, as Kika says, ‘both our lives had disappeared. For what use are memories if they only exist for one person’. She was placed in the unique position of grieving for a man who was not technically dead. To all intents and purposes, Corin was insane. Moved to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in Bloomsbury, he thought he was ‘in some kind of hotel in Singapore’. He failed to recognise London, believing the trees and parks were a garden in Vienna. He didn’t want to co-operate with the doctors because ‘he didn’t think there was anything the matter . . . He thought people were lying to him and that his life was in danger.’ He was convinced he was the target of a ‘State conspiracy’ and the Secret Police were coming for him. ‘We must get away!’ he screamed. He tried to do just that, in a taxi. ‘Corin is angry and won’t be pacified,’ remembers Kika. Eventually, Vanessa offered to look after her brother at her flat. But there was little improvement. Such was Corin’s rage and fear, he reckoned people were hidden in the wardrobe, listening to him — so he insisted on silence. Piteously, he could never remember that his mother had died and faced ‘the terrible freshness of sorrow’ each time he was told the truth. He started to confuse Kika with his first wife, Deirdre, and what it boiled down to was that Corin no longer had any capacity to reflect. He could only cope and survive ‘in the moment’. Kika talking about her memoirs. She says that by the time Corin's brain damage had set in they had both lost their lives. The miracle, however — the anomaly — is that, despite being sectioned in a mental hospital, despite his increasing ‘disinhibition’ (urinating in public view, buttonholing complete strangers), despite his loss of co-ordination and balance, Corin’s ‘creative power has not diminished one bit’, and he could still work: Beckett on the radio, film and television cameos. But then, he could go quite unpredictably crazy again. Hearing a playback of himself in King Lear, he asked, without trying to be funny: ‘Who’s written this? It’s not Shakespeare. Who’s written it?’ Within the midst of this maelstrom, Kika’s steadfastness is an inspiration, like a heroine in a Greek tragedy. Though ‘we were unable to communicate with one another through familiar ways’, and even though Corin had no remorse about his condition (because he didn’t believe he was poorly — asked if he was upset at having no recollection of his life with Kika he said, rather callously, ‘No, not really. It’s strange’), she never for a single second gives up on what they’d had, what they’d been, before the darkness fell. Darkness fell for good in 2010, when Corin suffered a burst aneurysm. His ashes are interred in Highgate Cemetery — not kept in the car. ‘I was alone,’ says Kika, ‘without a plan.’ The actuality is that she’d already been alone for years.

It also covers his tumultuous personal life, including his marriage to Kika Markham and their efforts to fight against Thatcherism, unemployment, and racism.  In 2005, Redgrave's health took a dramatic turn when he suffered severe brain damage from a lack of oxygen following a cardiac arrest. This left him with memory loss, unable to remember his life with his wife, and plagued by paranoia and delusions. Despite these challenges, Redgrave's creative abilities remained intact, and he continued to work in radio, film and television until his death in 2010.

The process of hibernation involves the consumption of food, finding or building a shelter, and physiological changes to conserve energy. An increase in dust particles on bread may affect the quality of food available to the animal, but this perturbation would only be relevant if the animal's primary food source is bread. If the animal relies on other food sources to fatten up, this perturbation would have no significant impact on the hibernation process.

The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues.  Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Team W had more people receiving the first antiviral drug. The reason for this is that Team W had many people with HIV among its members, which indicates they were more likely to be exposed to antiviral drugs or antiretroviral therapy (ART) being developed to treat viral diseases, including HIV.

Among the subranges of the Appalachians located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains, Blue Ridge Mountains, Great Balsam Mountains, and Black Mountains. The Black Mountains are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet (2,037 m) the highest point east of the Mississippi River. Although agriculture still remains important, tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains. Growing Christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well.

It is not possible to conclude that \\"A brown dog playing in mud\\" if \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath\\". The two statements are independent and unrelated events happening to two different dogs. Therefore, it would be illogical to establish a connection between the two scenarios. In the first scenario, \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath,\\" we have a white dog that has just taken a bath. This event tells us that the dog is now likely to be clean and possibly refreshed after the bath. However, this information does not provide any insight into what a separate, brown dog might be doing or experiencing in another setting. The second scenario, \\"A brown dog playing in mud,\\" describes a situation where a brown dog is engaging in an activity in the mud. This event tells us that the dog is now likely to get dirty due to playing in the mud. Again, this information has no direct relationship with the white dog and its bathing situation. Thus, the two events are separate, and no conclusion can be drawn between them. There is no information given about the activities or condition of the brown dog based on the activities or condition of the white dog, and vice versa. To establish a connection, there would need to be additional information linking the two events – either through the behavior patterns of both dogs, their shared environment, or any other related factors.

The first statement – \\"A furry brown dog carries his toy in mouth outside.\\" – provides specific details about the dog's appearance and actions. Here, a furry brown dog is carrying a toy in its mouth, likely playing on its own or with another dog, and the scene takes place outside. This statement focuses on the playful nature of the dog but doesn't mention any interaction with a child. On the other hand, the statement \\"A dog is playing with a child.\\" describes a situation where a dog and a child engage in a play activity together. This statement doesn't provide any details about the dog's appearance or the type of play involved. Additionally, it does not specify the location of the play; it could be indoors or outdoors. In sum, while both statements relate to a dog participating in playful behavior, they describe distinct scenarios. The first statement implies that the dog is engaged in play with a toy, while the second statement emphasizes the interaction between the dog and a child.

Her parents, Joseph Sprague Gibbs and his actress wife Katharine Clinton Francis, had been married in 1903; however, by the time their daughter was four, Joseph had left the family. Francis inherited her unusual height from her father, who stood 6 feet 4 inches. She was to become Hollywood's tallest leading lady (5 ft 9 in) in the 1930s. Context: By that time, major film studios, which had formerly been based in New York, were already well-established in California, and many Broadway actors had been enticed to travel west to Hollywood to make sound films, including Ann Harding, Aline MacMahon, Helen Twelvetrees, Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, and Leslie Howard. Francis, signed to a contract with Paramount Pictures, also made the move and created an immediate impression. She frequently co-starred with William Powell and appeared in as many as six to eight movies a year, making a total of 21 films between 1929 and 1931.  Francis's career flourished in spite of a slight but distinctive speech impediment (she pronounced the letters \\"r\\" and \\"l\\" as \\"w\\") that gave rise to the nickname \\"Wavishing Kay Fwancis.\\"  Francis' career at Paramount changed gears when Warner Bros. promised her star status at a better salary. She appeared in George Cukor's Girls About Town (1931) and Twenty-Four Hours (1931). After Francis' career skyrocketed at Warner Bros., she would return to Paramount for Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise (1932).  In 1932, Warner Bros. persuaded both Francis and Powell to join the ranks of Warners stars, along with Ruth Chatterton. In exchange, Francis was given roles that allowed her a more sympathetic screen persona than had hitherto been the case--in her first three featured roles she had played a villainess. For example, in The False Madonna (1932), she played a jaded society woman nursing a terminally ill child who learns to appreciate the importance of hearth and home. On December 16, 1931, Francis and her co-stars opened the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California with a gala preview screening of The False Madonna. Question: Did she make any films after 1931? Answer:","output":"Yes, Kay Francis made many films after 1931. She continued to act in movies throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. Her career flourished, and she played various roles in many films, making her a popular actress during that time. So, after 1931, she still appeared in a lot of films and continued to entertain people with her performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kaukasuksen alueen rauhan ja vakauden saavuttaminen on tärkeä tavoite Euroopan unionille. Tämän tavoitteen saavuttamiseksi Euroopan unionin on luotava ja toteutettava tehokas pitkän aikavälin strategia. Äärimmäisen monimutkaisessa geopoliittisessa tilanteessa tällainen strategia vaatii huolellista harkintaa, ajan ja resurssien investointia sekä tiivistä yhteistyötä alueen maiden ja muiden kansainvälisten toimijoiden kanssa. Ensinnäkin, Euroopan unionin tulisi keskittyä lujittamaan alueen maiden kanssa tehtävää poliittista ja taloudellista yhteistyötä. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi energiamarkkinoiden, infrastruktuurin ja kaupan aloilla tehtävien yhteistyöhankkeiden edistämistä sekä vahvempaa tukea demokratian, ihmisoikeuksien ja oikeusvaltion kunnioittamiseen alueella. Lisäksi unionin tulisi tukea institutionaalisia uudistuksia ja hyvän hallinnon käytäntöjä Kaukasuksen maissa. Toiseksi, unionin olisi etsittävä konstruktioivista ratkaisuja alueen useisiin jäätyneisiin konflikteihin ja pyrittävä aktiivisesti edistämään rauhanprosesseja, kuten Azerbaidžanin ja Armenian välisen Vuoristo-Karabahin konfliktin käsittelyä Minskin ryhmän puitteissa. Tähän liittyen unionin tulisi myös tukea alueellista yhteistyötä ja luottamusta rakentavia hankkeita, jotka voivat auttaa lieventämään jännitteitä ja edistämään yhteisymmärrystä naapuruussuhteissa. Kolmanneksi, Euroopan unionin on otettava huomioon alueen energia- ja ympäristökysymykset strategiassaan. Esimerkiksi unionin tulisi edistää energiavarmuutta alueella tukemalla vaihtoehtoisten energialähteiden kehittämistä ja monipuolistamalla energiahuoltovarmuuteen liittyviä yhteyksiä. Lisäksi unionin olisi tuettava alueen ympäristönsuojelua ja kestävän kehityksen hankkeita, erityisesti ilmastonmuutoksen torjumiseksi ja luonnonvarojen hallinnan parantamiseksi. Neljänneksi, EU:n tulisi vahvistaa yhteistyötään alueen muiden kansainvälisten toimijoiden kanssa, kuten Yhdysvaltain, Venäjän, Turkin ja Iranin kanssa, pyrkiäkseen löytämään yhteisiä etuja ja edistääkseen ratkaisuja alueen kohtaamiin haasteisiin. Tämä vaatii joustavaa ja pragmaattista lähestymistapaa, joka ottaa huomioon toimijoiden erilaiset edut ja huolenaiheet. Lopuksi, Euroopan unionin tulisi osoittaa sitoutumistaan ja täysipainoistaan rooliaan Kaukasuksen rauhan ja vakauden edistämisessä EU:n eri ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan välineiden kautta, esimerkiksi EU:n erityisedustajan Kaukasiassa sekä Euroopan turvallisuus- ja puolustuspolitiikan operaatioiden avulla.

Question: I read this background article the other day: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.  I am facing a new situation today: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beach had better and larger waves? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article, we can infer that shallow water plays a significant role in the formation of higher, steeper, and better waves for surfing. Let's break down the information step-by-step to determine which beach has better and larger waves. Step 1: Recall the effect of shallow water on wave formation The article states that when waves travel into areas of shallow water, they become higher and steeper due to the disruption of the orbital motion of water. This results in the familiar sharp-crested wave shape which is ideal for surfing. Step 2: Compare the water depth at Wide beach and Sandy beach Wide beach is known for its shallow water, which contributes to the formation of better waves for surfing. On the other hand, Sandy beach has deeper water at the shore. Step 3: Evaluate the wave quality at both beaches Since shallow water promotes the formation of better waves for surfing, we can infer that Wide beach, with its shallow water, has better and larger waves compared to Sandy beach, which has deeper water at the shore. Answer: Wide beach has better and larger waves for surfing due to the shallow water in the area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This picks up about a year after the events in \\"Basic Instinct\\". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the Thames. She survives--he doesn't. The police hire psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial. Naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow. This movie was doomed before it even opened. It took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the movie often). Still it's not too bad. It's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an R), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact. It feels like a retread of the first. People are being killed here with a choker leash (I believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first. In one cute moment Stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly. She's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders. The similarities are too apparent. This is also VERY R rated--there's plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks a lot better nude than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The acting is good across the board. Stone is just fantastic here; Morrissey looks miserable but is OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good in supporting roles. So--this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first. Still I recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to \\"Basic...\\" 14 years after it was made.","output":"This review has a mixed sentiment. The person who wrote it thinks the movie has some good elements, like the music score, beautiful locations, and good acting.

Question: suppose the paddle is broken happens, how will it affect the water paddle is obstructed.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the water paddle is broken or obstructed, it will directly affect the water circulation mechanism of the dishwasher, which is primarily responsible for propelling water upwards and its subsequent distribution through the small holes in the paddle to clean the dishes. The entire performance of the dishwasher is contingent upon the pivotal role that the paddle carries out.  The immediate consequence will be that the heated water, which is meant to be forced up the pipes by the pump and then dispersed over the dishes by the spinning paddles, will most likely fail to be uniformly delivered, producing an inadequate cleaning effect.  Coming to the second mentioned effect, which is the function of the heating element heating the water, this part of the operation remains relatively unaffected, as the heating element and the paddle are task-independent. Once the cold water is incepted into the bottom of the dishwasher, the heating element is tasked with heating this water to a suitable temperature for an effective cleaning operation. The obstruction or non-functioning of the paddle will have no direct impact on the heating element's operations in a typical dishwasher. Therefore, it will still be able to heat the water without a hitch. With a dispersed heating mechanism at the base, the heating element doesn't rely on the paddle for completion of this process. Hence, this implies that the heating process would function as expected, i.e., it would continue to imbue the dishwater with the requisite heat. However, it is crucial to note that while the heating operation won't be affected directly, the overall cleaning efficiency of the dishwasher would be compromised due to the broken or obstructed paddle scenario. As the water won't be sufficiently agitated and splashed onto the dishes to clean, the mixture of detergent and water, despite being at the correct temperature, won't reach the dishes leading to an inadequate washing session. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the water paddle being broken or obstructed would considerably affect the water circulation for effectively washing the dishes, but this adversity would inflict no effect on the operation of the water being heated by the heating element. The broken paddle, therefore, has \\"No Effect” on the second effect of heating water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture... According to the above context, answer the following question. When did Aimee Lind found the California Architecture Archive network?

It said the scaling down did not lessen the seriousness of the incident. Police have made a second arrest, a 16-year-old boy from west London, in connection with the investigation into an alleged data theft from TalkTalk. He was held on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, and later bailed, after detectives searched an address in Feltham, Scotland Yard said. On Monday, a 15-year-old boy was arrested and bailed in Northern Ireland in connection with the hacking. The Metropolitan Police said officers had searched a residential address in Liverpool. In an update on its website, TalkTalk also said hackers had accessed a maximum of 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details, with the middle six digits removed, and 15,000 customer dates of birth. The phone and broadband provider, which has more than four million UK customers, said it would be writing to all affected customers to let them know what information had been accessed. It said that any stolen credit or debit card details were incomplete - and therefore could not be used for financial transactions - but advised customers to remain vigilant against fraud. TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said the scale of attack was \\"much smaller than we originally suspected\\", but that did not detract from the seriousness of the incident. \\"We know that we need to work hard to earn back your trust and everyone here is committed to doing that,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more plate movement occurs happens, how will it affect LESS or WEAKER earthquakes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Under the perturbation hypothesis, if more plate movement occurs, the effect on less or weaker earthquakes can be analyzed by assessing how the increased plate movement influences each step of the earthquake generation process. The main question is whether this increased activity results in a direct or indirect effect on the process that leads to weaker earthquakes. To understand this, let us examine the earthquake generation process in detail. 1. Energy builds up in the crust of the earth: As the tectonic plates constantly move, stress accumulates in the crust of the earth. If there is more plate movement, stress and strain would presumably build up faster along the fault lines, increasing the potential energy stored in the rock formations. This increase in stored energy may lead to more frequent release of this energy in the form of earthquakes. 2. The energy causes the fault lines to give way: Faults are areas of weakness in the earth's crust where the strain has surpassed the rock's strength. As the energy accumulates in the crust, the fault lines are more susceptible to slipping and giving way. In the perturbation hypothesis, the increased plate movement could cause faults to rupture more frequently, thereby triggering more earthquakes. However, it is unclear whether these earthquakes would be predominantly weaker or stronger. 3. The earth's plates move: The movement of tectonic plates drives the generation of earthquakes, as the slip along a fault line releases the pent-up energy stored in the crust. With increased plate movement, there may be more frequent interactions and readjustments along the fault boundaries. This could lead to an overall increase in seismic activity across the entire earthquake spectrum, from weak to strong events. 4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: When an earthquake occurs, the released energy radiates outward from the fault in the form of seismic waves. If increased plate movement leads to more earthquakes, there would be a consequent increase in seismic wave energy traveling through the earth's crust. This could create a more seismically active environment, contributing to more earthquakes of varying magnitudes. 5. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it: Seismic waves cause the shaking and vibrations experienced during an earthquake. More plate movement can result in denser seismic wave activity, which could potentially create an environment where weaker earthquakes may be induced by the ongoing movement along faults or even the interference between seismic waves. Additionally, these disturbances could also weaken the rocks near the fault lines, making them more prone to failure, potentially resulting in weaker earthquakes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased plate movement could have both direct and indirect effects on the process leading to weaker earthquakes. Directly, the increased plate movement may cause more rapid energy accumulation and increased stress along fault lines, which could result in more frequent earthquakes, including weaker ones. Indirectly, the heightened seismicity and denser seismic wave activity could weaken rocks and create an environment more prone to weaker earthquakes due to enhanced interactions and triggering effects. However, it is essential to note that these effects would depend on various factors, including the tectonic setting and the presence of existing fault networks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station.  Question: suppose more coal is mined happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more coal is mined, it should ideally result in more coal arriving at the power station. However, the question states that there's an observed decrease in coal arriving at the power station despite increased mining. To answer how the supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned, we can examine several factors that could lead to less coal arriving at the power station: 1. Transportation issues: If the trucks or other transportation methods used to transport the coal are not capable of handling the increased amount of mined coal, then the excess coal may not reach the power station, thereby resulting in less coal arriving than expected. 2. Inefficient extraction: The process of excavating and removing coal from the mine might be inefficient, resulting in more coal being mined but not all of it actually being extracted and transported to the surface. Some of the coal could be left behind or wasted during the extraction process. 3. Loss during transportation: Coal might be lost during transportation due to accidents, leakage, or theft. The more coal that's mined, the greater the likelihood that some of it might be lost during transportation. 4. Increased demand from other destinations: If the mined coal is being distributed to multiple destinations, an increase in demand from other locations might result in less coal arriving at the power station in question. 5. Changes in power station's capacity: The power station itself may have undergone operational changes that limit the amount of coal it can process or store, resulting in less coal arriving at the facility even if more coal is mined. In conclusion, while more coal being mined is expected to increase the amount of coal arriving at the power station, this correlation can be disrupted by various factors that lead to a decrease in coal at the power station. The factors mentioned above could be responsible for creating a situation where more coal is mined, but less coal arrives at the power station."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Amid rumours that precision gene-editing techniques have been used to modify the DNA of human embryos, researchers have called for a moratorium on the use of the technology in reproductive cells.      MOLEKUUL/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY      In a Comment published on 12 March in Nature1, Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, and four co-authors call on scientists to agree not to modify human embryos — even for research.      “Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications. We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development,” write Lanphier and his colleagues, who include Fyodor Urnov, a pioneer in gene-editing techniques and scientist at Sangamo BioSciences in Richmond, California. Many groups, including Urnov's company, are already using gene-editing tools to develop therapies that correct genetic defects in people (such as by editing white blood cells). They fear that attempts to produce ‘designer babies’ by applying the methods to embryos will create a backlash against all use of the technology.      Known as germline modification, edits to embryos, eggs or sperm are of particular concern because a person created using such cells would have had their genetic make-up changed without consent, and would permanently pass down that change to future generations.      “We need a halt on anything that approaches germline editing in human embryos,” Lanphier, who is also chief executive of Sangamo, told Nature’s news team.      But other scientists disagree with that stance. Although there needs to be a wide discussion of the safety and ethics of editing embryos and reproductive cells, they say, the potential to eliminate inherited diseases means that scientists should pursue research.      Related trials      Geneticist Xingxu Huang of ShanghaiTech University in China, for example, is currently seeking permission from his institution’s ethics committee to try genetically modifying discarded human embryos. In February 2014, he reported2 using a gene-editing technique to modify embryos that developed into live monkeys. Human embryos would not be allowed to develop to full term in his experiments, but the technique “gives lots of potential for its application in humans,” he says.      Besides Huang’s work, gene-editing techniques are also being used by Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a developmental biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, to eliminate disease-causing mutations from mitochondria, the cell's energy-processing structures. Belmonte's work is on unfertilized eggs; human eggs with such modified mitochondria could one day be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures to prevent a woman's offspring from inheriting mitochondrial disease.      There are also suspicions that scientists have already created human embryos with edited genomes. Several researchers who do not want to be named told Nature’s news team that papers describing such work are being considered for publication.      Scientists who attended a meeting in Napa, California, in January to discuss potential uses of germline gene-editing have written a perspective paper about their concerns for publication in Science. Geneticist Dana Carroll of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was at the Napa meeting, says that it will call for discussions of the safety and ethics of using editing techniques on human embryos.      “Germline genome alterations are permanent and heritable, so very, very careful consideration needs to be taken in advance of such applications,” Carroll says.      Wide concerns      Germline gene editing is already banned by law in many countries — a 2014 review by Tetsuya Ishii, a bioethicist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, found that of 39 countries, 29 have laws or guidelines that ban the practice. But the development of precise gene-editing techniques in recent years has brought fresh urgency to the issue. These techniques use enzymes called nucleases to snip DNA at specific points and then delete or rewrite the genetic information at those locations. The methods are simple enough to be used in a fertility clinic, raising fears that they might be applied in humans before safety concerns have been addressed.      One concern, for example, is that the nucleases could cause mutations at locations other than those targeted. Guanghui Liu, a stem-cell researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Biophysics in Beijing, collaborated on a study3 that showed that modifying one gene in stem cells resulted in minimal mutations elsewhere, but he warns that this is only one case.      Every application to use gene-editing technology for a therapy would have to be validated independently as safe and effective, says Jennifer Doudna, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It would be necessary to decide, for each potential application, whether the risks outweigh the possible benefit to a patient. I think this assessment must be made on a case-by-case basis,” she says.      Ishii worries about countries such as the United States: there, germline editing is not banned but requires government approval, but such restrictions have a history of being circumvented, as in the case of unproven stem-cell treatments. He is also concerned about China, which prohibits gene-editing of embryos but does not strictly enforce similar rules, as shown by failed attempts to curb the use of ultrasound for sex selection and to stamp out unauthorized stem-cell clinics. China is also where gene-editing techniques in primates have developed fastest. “There are already a lot of dodgy fertility clinics around the world,” he says. ||||| Biotechnology that can rewrite the genome heralds \\"a new era of human biology\\" and raises ethical questions for the medical community, experts in bioethics, and everybody else, according to a group of prominent researchers writing in Science.      The fuss is over \\"DNA scissors\\" discovered in microbes in 2012 that can be adapted to edit genetic material, potentially removing disease-enabling mutations and adding in \\"corrected\\" DNA strings. Known by its scientific acronym, the CRISPR-Cas9 protein may eventually help realize precision or individualized medicine, the ability to treat or avoid illness such as cancers, muscular dystrophy, and HIV/AIDS by tinkering with the actual genetic coding that makes a person that particular person.      “The simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system allows any researcher with knowledge of molecular biology to modify genomes,” write the 18 scientists, from institutions that include Caltech, Berkeley, Harvard and Stanford. They are led by Nobel-winning biologist David Baltimore of Caltech.      That's a complicated, and potentially dangerous, power. The group recommends that scientists avoid human genome-editing experiments, even where they're legal, and that research and funding sources be transparent. This is the second call to arms in two weeks. An essay last week in Nature called for a moratorium on experiments on human embryos, eggs, or sperm.      Genome engineering has become so powerful that civic leaders and the general public should be brought into the debate, the scientists say. What happens if CRISPR snips out the wrong DNA, or adds in a sequence in the wrong place? If these techniques are ever deemed safe and effective, who would qualify for treatment, and when? The mind reels. When's the next remake of The Fly? Don't it make my brown eyes blue?      A revolution in basic research is already under way. Labs around the world have demonstrated the potency of CRISPR. Scientists at Virginia Tech put out a study on Monday that shows how gene editing in mosquitoes may lead to novel strategies to fight the spread of malaria. New approaches to attacking HIV may come from snipping the virus out of human cells, according to Salk Institute research published this month. Korean researchers in February made news by testing the technique on human cells. The Center for Genome Engineering at Seoul's Institute for Basic Science boasts: \\"The whole genome is under our control.\\"      Is it? Scientists involved in the discovery have founded competing start-ups to commercialize what's considered the most revolutionary bioengineering technology since the advent of recombinant DNA in the 1970s, MIT's Technology Review reported in December.      The questions surrounding CRISPR-Cas9 are emblematic of a cultural shift in the very meaning of the human body. Consider this novelty story from last week. In 1962, Winston Churchill was hospitalized for a broken hip. After his release, a student nurse at the hospital got permission to take a vial of his blood home as a memento, instead of destroying it. Before she died, she gave it to a friend, who put it up for auction this year to mark the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death. The auction house pulled the item from its catalog before its scheduled March 12 sale, at the request of Churchill’s heirs.      No part of that story is OK, from the initial taking of someone’s blood without his knowledge to its proposed sale with public fanfare. New York Presbyterian Medical Center, where former president Bill Clinton had heart surgery in 2010, didn't return a call about procedures in place that prevent such episodes today. Can't blame them. It's a ridiculous question, or should be.      And maybe today it's an unnecessary one. Biological and medical technologies have evolved, and ethics, slowly, with them. Legal and professional institutions treat human blood and tissue as personal information that belongs to an individual, not potential souvenirs.      The revolution in thinking about the human body is only getting started. The remains of saints used to be kept and venerated for generations, said Ross McKinney, director of the Trent Center for Bioethics at Duke University. \\"There was a rich history of hanging on to bits of famous people and imparting to it miraculous properties,\\" he said. \\"More recently we'd be more concerned about the possibility that somebody can go chasing after genetic information that really gets into the privacy of the heirs and relatives of the individual.\\"      Ever since scientists developed powerful genome sequencers, DNA has been “readable” in a way that’s analogous to books, credit cards, or email. Code is just code: If there's any information in a string of characters—whether it's rendered in a binary, alphabetical, or genetic code—we can crack it.      It's a common enough notion in computing. As computers became more powerful in the '90s and '00s, the \\"read-only memory\\" of CD-ROMs morphed into storage disks capable of \\"read-write memory.\\" CRISPR-Cas9 makes the comparison as real as ever. The genetic code is the software that runs living things, and just as with digital technology, DNA is being upgraded, from a read-only to a read-write medium. ||||| Recombinant DNA was the first in a series of ever-improving steps for manipulating genetic material. The chief problem has always been one of accuracy, of editing the DNA at precisely the intended site, since any off-target change could be lethal. Two recent methods, known as zinc fingers and TAL effectors, came close to the goal of accurate genome editing, but both are hard to use. The new genome-editing approach was invented by Jennifer A. Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and Emmanuelle Charpentier of Umea University in Sweden.      Their method, known by the acronym Crispr-Cas9, co-opts the natural immune system with which bacteria remember the DNA of the viruses that attack them so they are ready the next time those same invaders appear. Researchers can simply prime the defense system with a guide sequence of their choice and it will then destroy the matching DNA sequence in any genome presented to it. Dr. Doudna is the lead author of the Science article calling for control of the technique and organized the meeting at which the statement was developed.      Though highly efficient, the technique occasionally cuts the genome at unintended sites. The issue of how much mistargeting could be tolerated in a clinical setting is one that Dr. Doudna’s group wants to see thoroughly explored before any human genome is edited.      Scientists also say that replacing a defective gene with a normal one may seem entirely harmless but perhaps would not be.      “We worry about people making changes without the knowledge of what those changes mean in terms of the overall genome,” Dr. Baltimore said. “I personally think we are just not smart enough — and won’t be for a very long time — to feel comfortable about the consequences of changing heredity, even in a single individual.”      Many ethicists have accepted the idea of gene therapy, changes that die with the patient, but draw a clear line at altering the germline, since these will extend to future generations. The British Parliament in February approved the transfer of mitochondria, small DNA-containing organelles, to human eggs whose own mitochondria are defective. But that technique is less far-reaching because no genes are edited.      There are two broad schools of thought on modifying the human germline, said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin and a member of the Doudna group. One is pragmatic and seeks to balance benefit and risk. The other “sets up inherent limits on how much humankind should alter nature,” she said. Some Christian doctrines oppose the idea of playing God, whereas in Judaism and Islam there is the notion “that humankind is supposed to improve the world.” She described herself as more of a pragmatist, saying, “I would try to regulate such things rather than shut a new technology down at its beginning.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Scientists have developed a new technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which is like a pair of DNA scissors. These scissors can cut DNA in specific places and might help fix genetic diseases by removing bad parts of the DNA and adding good ones. However, some people are worried about the possible dangers of changing human DNA and think that there should be a limit on how much we can change our genetic makeup. They also worry about things going wrong if the DNA scissors snip something they shouldn't. So, scientists and other people need to have a big discussion about using this new technique safely and ethically, especially when it comes to making changes to a person's DNA that could be passed down to their children and future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate.

Write highlights for this article: The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases. In a 5-4 decision, the justices affirmed conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases blamed for global warming are pollutants. Although it concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency could not completely extend its regulatory authority for limiting the expansion or building of new facilities like power plants. The ruling, on a case seen as a major test of executive authority, gave both sides of the politically charged debate some reason to celebrate. But it also may have the longer term effect of extending legal fights for years. Many conservative groups have characterized President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of Congress. Industry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure. Businesses worry any unchecked expansion of rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. The court agreed to some extent. Justice Antonin Scalia said the \\"EPA's rewriting of the statute was impermissible.\\" But the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end, since EPA can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases. \\"EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,\\" said Scalia. The agency responded positively to the decision. \\"Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations,\\" it said in a statement. The government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal-fired plants. And the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry. Obama earlier this year announced new rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted him to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing Obamacare reforms, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. Defining \\"air pollutant\\" within the context of greenhouse gases and the ability of the EPA to exercise its regulatory authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- was the issue here. \\"Today the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a stern rebuke to the President,\\" said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. \\"It is a resounding defeat for those, like the President, who would use unelected bureaucracies to override the will of the people.\\" Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases were reviewed by the court. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices earlier this year allowed the EPA to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, and requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. Many business groups had hoped the conservative majority would limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation.","output":"The US Supreme Court preserved the majority of the government's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, despite taking away some power to tighten emission standards. The 5-4 decision recognized greenhouse gases as pollutants but limited the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to regulate the expansion or construction of new facilities like power plants. This ruling may prolong legal battles and was seen as a test of executive authority. While the court majority expressed that the administration's power was not too constrained, allowing the EPA to continue regulating 97% of the greenhouse gas emissions sources, tensions persist between the administration and industry over emission controls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.  - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England.  - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century.  - South Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is the southernmost county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region and had a population of 1.34 million in 2011. It has an area of and consists of four metropolitan boroughs, Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. South Yorkshire was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 with Barnsley as its county town.  - Scandinavian York ( also referred to as Jórvík ) or Danish / Norwegian York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria ( modern day Yorkshire ) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century , when it was dominated by Norse warrior - kings ; in particular , used to refer to the city ( York ) controlled by these kings . Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954 , however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by England between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954 . It was closely associated with the much longer - lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period .  - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.  - The East Riding of Yorkshire, or simply East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county of England. It is located in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber. The East Riding of Yorkshire may also refer to a local government district with unitary authority status, which does not include the city of Kingston upon Hull, the largest settlement in the ceremonial county, which is a separate unitary authority. The modern East Riding of Yorkshire (both ceremonial county and unitary authority), was formed in 1996 from the northern part of the non-metropolitan county of Humberside.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.

As the distance grew between him and the boat, the ship got Smaller or Larger?    Assuming that:  If you are standing on the shore and a ship is going out to sea, the ship gets smaller as it moves further away from you. Answer:","output":"As he was standing on the beach and watching the boat, it began to drift away. The experience of watching the boat move farther from him was a result of the boat's increasing distance from the shore, as well as the optical mechanism of perspective. This perspective is a fundamental visual phenomenon that our brains use to interpret and render the three-dimensional world around us onto the two-dimensional plane of our retinas. As the boat moved away from him on the shore, the distance between them increased, resulting in the ship appearing smaller in his field of vision. This occurrence can be explained through the concept of angular size, a measure of how large an object appears to an observer based on the visual angle. The larger the distance between an object and an observer, the smaller the visual angle, and hence, the smaller the object appears to the observer. The process of the boat appearing smaller as it moves away can be further elucidated by understanding the relationship between an object's actual size, its distance from the observer, and its perceived size. The perceived size of an object is primarily influenced by the actual size of the object and its distance from the observer. In this scenario, as the boat moves further away from the beach, its actual size remains the same, but the increasing distance causes the perceived size to decrease. The phenomenon of an object appearing smaller as it moves away from the observer (in this case, the person on the beach) is further influenced by atmospheric conditions and the Earth's curvature. These factors can cause the boat to seem lower on the horizon, and depending on visibility, it may eventually disappear from view altogether. This event occurs because, as objects move farther away from the observer, they appear to coalesce towards the horizon line, which is a visual convergence point where the sky seems to meet the Earth's surface. In conclusion, as the boat began to drift away from the person standing on the beach, the ship appeared smaller because of the increasing distance between them and the resulting decrease in the boat's angular size. The actual size of the boat remained the same throughout this process; however, the perceived size decreased due to the impact of the distance on the visual angle and the perspective experienced by the observer. Therefore, given the assumption that a ship appears smaller as it moves further away from the shore, the answer to the question is that the ship got smaller as the distance between the observer and the boat increased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.  and a hint : When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20]  Please answer this question : Which year was there a break in the monsoon regime? The answer is:","output":"In 2019, there was a break in the monsoon regime. This was due to the subtropical ridge lacking strength and not migrating far enough northward to bring monsoon conditions to the Four Corners area. In contrast, 2018 was a very wet year for the region, as the subtropical ridge was stronger and moved further north, allowing monsoon moisture and thunderstorms to extend into the United States, including Arizona. The subtropical ridge plays a critical role in determining the monsoon pattern for the Four Corners region. It is a high-pressure system that influences weather conditions and precipitation patterns across North America, especially during the summer months. When the subtropical ridge is stronger than normal and positioned further north than usual, it results in a more favorable environment for monsoon activity to take place, which leads to a wetter rainy season for the area. In 2018, the strength and position of the subtropical ridge contributed to the wet monsoon season in the Four Corners area. Its favorable positioning allowed monsoon moisture and thunderstorms to extend into the United States, which led to increased rainfall in the region. The strong influence of the subtropical ridge resulted in significantly higher amounts of precipitation during that year compared to average levels. On the other hand, 2019 experienced a dry year due to the same weather phenomenon lacking strength and not migrating far enough northward. This suppression of the subtropical ridge to the south resulted in a much drier atmosphere across the Desert Southwest and caused a break in the usual monsoon regime the Four Corners area would experience. The lack of significant monsoon moisture and thunderstorm activity led to a substantial decrease in the amount of rainfall received by the region during that year. In conclusion, the year 2019 saw a break in the monsoon regime due to the suppressed strength and position of the subtropical ridge. This weather phenomenon is crucial in determining the monsoon pattern in the Four Corners area, where its strength and northward migration influence the extent of monsoon moisture and thunderstorms and, ultimately, the amount of rainfall the region receives during the rainy season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\".

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Now, I have a new situation: Two sisters went to the doctor to get screened for cancer. Lisa had cancer, while her sister Beth didn't.

Where are the Huygens Gap and the Maxwell Gap?","output":"The Huygens Gap and the Maxwell Gap are specific regions located within the rings of the planet Saturn. To fully appreciate their significance, it is important to provide an overview of Saturn's rings and their composition. Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is known for its spectacular ring system. This ring system is divided into several parts that are named alphabetically based on the order in which they were discovered, from A to G. The rings consist primarily of ice particles, with the size ranging from tiny dust grains to large chunks several meters across. In addition to ice, the rings also contain small amounts of rocky material and dust. The rings are organized into several divisions based on their structure and density, with gaps either due to the gravitational influence of Saturn's moons or other dynamics within the ring system. The Huygens Gap is located within the outer edge of the 'A' ring, one of Saturn's prominent and relatively dense rings. It is a region that is remarkably less dense compared to the surrounding region of the 'A' ring. The Huygens Gap is named after Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Saturn's moon, Titan, and observed Saturn's rings. The gap extends from a distance of approximately 117,500 kilometers to 117,930 kilometers from Saturn's center. One key feature of the Huygens Gap is the presence of Saturn's moon Mimas, whose gravity helps maintain this gap's structure. The Maxwell Gap is situated inside the 'C' ring of Saturn and is less prominent compared to the Huygens Gap. It is named after Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who developed a theory explaining the stability of Saturn's rings. This gap is a well-defined gap, which extends from about 87,500 kilometers to 88,000 kilometers from Saturn's center. The Maxwell Gap is also sometimes referred to as the Maxwell Division. In conclusion, both the Huygens Gap and the Maxwell Gap are specific regions found within Saturn's impressive ring system. The Huygens Gap is located at the outer edge of the 'A' ring, whereas the Maxwell Gap can be found within the 'C' ring.

Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal. Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army. Austin and Caldwell share a mutual dislike for one another. The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lawrence, as Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. Lawrence is the registered owner of a Tokarev, but claims he lost it in a poker game. Austin also learns that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer was registered to a civilian named Arthur Peale (Mark Blum), who is wealthy and owns a holding company that, in turn, owns other companies. Austin tries to question Lawrence about the Tokarev, but Caldwell intervenes. This fuels Austin's suspicions that Caldwell will do anything to protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities, even if he is a killer. Recognizing that part of the case is under Caldwell's jurisdiction at the Presidio and part is under Austin's jurisdiction in San Francisco, they uneasily team up to investigate the case. Caldwell states that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch were to match a bullet fired earlier from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, then Caldwell will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest.

He pretends to be corrupt and asks her for 5,000 in return for hearing Wolfe's conversation with Laura Fromm. She responds... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery,\\" Saul, one of Nero Wolfe's trusted operatives, was visited by a thug for various reasons tied to the ongoing investigation. Saul is skilled at carrying out undercover assignments and gathering vital information for Wolfe's cases. In this particular case, Wolfe is hired to investigate the murders of Pete Drossos and Laura Fromm, as well as the abduction of a woman wearing golden spider earrings. There are a few reasons why Saul might have been visited by a thug during the course of the investigation: 1. Intimidation: As the investigation deepens and Wolfe's team gets closer to uncovering the truth behind the murders and the abduction, the people responsible for these crimes may decide to send a thug to intimidate and threaten Saul. This move is aimed at deterring him from continuing his investigative work and potentially disrupting Wolfe's progress in the case. 2. Information Gathering: The thug may have been sent to gather information from Saul or to plant surveillance devices, such as a listening device or a hidden camera, in his vicinity. This would allow the criminals to stay one step ahead of Wolfe and his team, and potentially adjust their tactics and cover their tracks more effectively. 3. Misdirection: It is possible that the visit by the thug was an attempt to mislead and distract Saul, turning his attention away from the real culprits and towards someone else. This could be due to the criminals having connections with the thug, or the thug himself being involved in the crimes. 4. Discrediting: The thug might have been sent to frame Saul, planting false evidence or creating the appearance of impropriety to discredit him in the eyes of Wolfe or the police. This would undermine his credibility in the investigation, and his efforts in solving the case would be undermined. 5. Personal Vendetta: Alternatively, the visit by the thug could be unrelated to the current investigation and might stem from a past encounter between Saul and the thug or the thug's associates. In this case, the visit may be to settle old scores or seek revenge for a perceived slight or betrayal. Without more information about the specific context and the identity of the thug, it is impossible to say exactly why Saul was visited by this individual. However, it is clear that as a member of Wolfe's team with a track record of uncovering secrets, Saul's involvement in the case puts him at risk of becoming a target for those who wish to prevent the truth from coming to light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection.

Astro-X has also developed a technology that is capable of using radio waves to diffuse tornadoes, leading to the end of the sharknado phenomenon. Fin travels to Molong with his cousin Gemini to meet up with his son Matt, who has returned from deployment in Iraq. Meanwhile, Reynolds has built and is opening a shark-themed hotel featuring a giant tank of sharks. While Matt and his fiancée, Gabrielle, marry and skydive from a plane, a sandstorm tornado develops that cannot be diffused by Astro-X. The tornado absorbs the water and sharks from Reynolds' hotel, creating the first sharknado in five years. The streets of Las Vegas flood, but Fin, Gemini, Gabrielle, and Matt work together to survive the storm until it heads back out into the desert. A:","output":"The full name of the person who owns the company that cannot diffuse the sandstorm tornado is Aston Reynolds. He is a tech mogul and, in the story, based on Tesla, Inc. co-founder and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Reynolds' company, Astro-X, developed technology capable of using radio waves to diffuse tornadoes but fails to diffuse the sandstorm tornado that created the first sharknado in five years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the employees of a theater find an old reel of film, they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead, assuming it's an old preview reel. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies. I can't understand the hate for this movie. It is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp, but it doesn't deserve a \\"1.1\\" here on IMDb. It is just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them. It has the feel of such things as Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and various others. I liked the explanation of how the zombies, though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead-unbelievable, perhaps, but I appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. Who was the mentor of \\"The Life\\" group?

November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design.

A six-year-old boy died in the attack and his young siblings were injured.      32-year-old Ronald Exantus reportedly told police he killed 6-year-old Logan Tipton with a kitchen knife. Prosecutors believe Exantus chose the home, near Lexington, Kentucky, at random.      Exantus lived with a girlfriend and three young children at an apartment near 86th and Township Line Rd. on the northwest side of Indianapolis. A neighbor said she saw the girlfriend just a few days ago and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, nothing that would indicate Exantus would appear Monday shackled in a Kentucky courtroom facing murder charges.            GoFundMe page set up to help family with expenses      “He's been unable to give me any information whatsoever,” Exantus’ public defender Bridget Hofler told a judge in court. Hofler said Exantus is not coherent and said may suffer from some mental condition.      “This little man was murdered in cold blood,” said Peter Barnhardt, who coached Tipton in a youth football league. “Logan just turned six in November, the 1st was his birthday. He was the sweetest kid you'd ever meet. The kid never met a stranger.”      A registered nurse with a license in good standing since 2013, Exantus worked with dialysis patients. Originally from Florida, he's lived in Central Indiana since at least 2009. He has no known criminal record and it's unclear why he made the nearly 200-mile trip to Kentucky, a trip that ended in what he admits was murder.      “I don't know, words can't put into it, said Tiffany Bourne, Tipton’s neighbor. \\"I just can't imagine how those parents feel.”      Exantus is scheduled to be back in court on December 14.

(AP) — The stabbing death of a kindergartner asleep in his home has plunged this Kentucky town into mourning, and shaken neighbors are rallying around the family even as they worry about their security. A man from Indiana described by authorities as having no apparent ties to the town or family has been charged with murder.      Christmas decorations adorn the house in Versailles, Ky., where a 6-year-old boy was killed during a break in Monday, Dec. 7, 2015. Police say a stranger from Indiana broke into the home and stabbed the... (Associated Press)      The death of the 6-year-old boy has police, neighbors and family in this small community of Versailles puzzled after the man from 200 miles away in Indiana was arrested and accused in police documents of repeatedly stabbing the boy in the head with a large kitchen knife. No motivation in the killing has been reported by authorities.      \\"It kind of hits close to home when it's a couple houses down from you,\\" said neighbor Tiffany Crow, who is now thinking of buying more locks for her home.      Logan Tipton was killed before dawn Monday when the intruder broke into his home, grabbed a large kitchen knife and stabbed the boy, police said.      \\"Babies aren't supposed to have anything like this happen to them,\\" said the boy's aunt, Melissa Pujol. \\"You can't make sense of it. You just have to try to get through it. We're just trying to get through it.\\"      Logan was a happy child, always smiling, she said. He loved to play football.      Police said Ronald Exantus, 32, of Indianapolis is accused of breaking into the house where the boy lived with his parents and siblings in Versailles, near Lexington in Kentucky's thoroughbred and bourbon country. The police citation alleges Exantus wandered around after gaining entry, then headed to an upstairs bedroom where the boy was asleep, stabbing him several times in the head.      Exantus has been charged with murder and first-degree burglary. He appeared in a Woodford County courtroom and entered a plea of not guilty Monday with bond set at 1 million by District Court Judge Vanessa Dickson.      \\"We're all kind of bumping our heads again a wall; it's mind-boggling,\\" said Versailles police Lt. Michael Fortney. \\"It's a child who had no opportunity to defend himself.\\"      Christmas lights and decorations, including a Snoopy wearing a Santa hat, adorned the small frame house where Logan had lived with his family. Two bikes and a basketball were strewn in the front yard. Neighbors said Logan and his siblings would be outside playing whenever weather permitted. Nearby are a couple of churches, one with a front yard sign reading: \\"Jesus is the reason for the season.\\"      The town has rallied around Logan's family.      Laura Burton Lacy, a family friend, set up an online fundraising account to raise money for his funeral, counseling for his siblings and other expenses. Community members collected 15,000 in just a few hours alone.      The family plans to move out of their house in the neighborhood.      Two of the boy's sisters suffered non-life-threatening cuts in the attack, and the suspect was held by the boy's father until police arrived, the arrest citation said. The boy's family told police they have never seen Exantus before.      \\"The family did all that they could,\\" Pujol said.      Fortney said police have found nothing to connect Extanus to the family or to the town.      Hours after the killing, an attorney appointed to represent Exantus questioned his mental competency. Bridget Hofler said at her client's arraignment that he was unresponsive when she asked him about his background and family. He didn't know his mother's phone number nor could he tell her his occupation or what he was doing in town, she said.      \\"I have discussed various things with him on two separate occasions this morning and he's not able to really discuss anything; he's not here,\\" Hofler told reporters afterward.      She told the judge she has heard her client is a registered nurse, but has been unable to confirm that. The Indiana Professional Licensing Agency lists a Ronald Exantus of Indianapolis as having an active nursing license.      Logan was a kindergartner at Simmons Elementary in Versailles. His classmates were told he had died, but not about the circumstances of his death, said county schools Superintendent Scott Hawkins.      \\"He was extremely well liked,\\" Hawkins said of the boy. \\"He had a lot of friends at the school. Just a great, great little boy, and one that you certainly loved having in your building.\\"      ___      Associated Press writer Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"An Indianapolis man, identified as 32-year-old Ronald Exantus, has been accused of driving 200 miles to Kentucky, breaking into a home, and stabbing several children inside.

(English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi.

Movie title: One-Eyed Jacks Movie plot: Rio (Marlon Brando) (also called \\"The Kid\\"), his mentor Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico. The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard. Longworth's awkward self-serving story is easily seen through. All along Rio planned not only to kill Dad, but to pull off a bank robbery in Monterey with his new partners Chico and \\"scum-suckin' pig\\" Bob Emory (Ben Johnson) (who used his knowledge of Dad's whereabouts to force their partnership). Plans... Answer:","output":"The bank that Rio plans to rob is located in Monterey, California. In the movie One-Eyed Jacks, Rio, played by Marlon Brando, seeks revenge against his former mentor, Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), who betrayed him during a bank robbery in Sonora, Mexico. After spending five years in a Sonora prison, Rio escapes with his new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and sets out to find Dad. Upon discovering Dad's location, Rio learns that he has used his ill-gotten wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of directly ambushing him, Rio decides to give Dad a chance to explain why he left him behind in Mexico. However, Rio can easily see through Dad's fabricated and self-serving story. With the help of his new partners, Chico and Bob Emory (Ben Johnson), Rio devises a plan not only to kill Dad but also to execute a bank robbery in Monterey as an additional act of vengeance. As Rio and his partners plot their course of action, they intend to make their presence felt in Monterey, striking at the very heart of Dad's newfound life and position of authority. This underscores the significance of the bank robbery as an integral part of Rio's quest for revenge against his former mentor and highlights the importance of the Monterey bank location within the framework of the movie's plot."},{"instruction":"After deciding to go out for a date, Ash walked with his girlfriend in hand.

Intrigued by the enigmatic gaze and the cryptic note on the back of the photo reading, \\"To those who dare to uncover, I was Gertrud\\", Anna's instinct as a journalist kick-starts a thrilling journey to uncover the mysterious woman. As Anna delves deeper into Gertrud's past, she discovers Gertrud was an eminent physicist during the Second World War, who disappeared at the height of her career. Anna finds herself drawn to Gertrud's defiance of male-dominated academia and her groundbreaking, yet under-acknowledged, contributions to theoretical physics. Simultaneously, Anna uncovers that Gertrud was also a spy working for the Resistance, providing top-secret information that led to significant victories. However, just days before the War ended, Gertrud vanished without any trace. Her contributions were buried, and her name was wiped clean from history. Anna also finds hints of a passionate yet tragic love story involving Gertrud and a fellow Resistance fighter named Erik. As Anna uncovers more secrets, the authorities grow uncomfortable, warning her off. However, a mysterious ally appears, guiding Anna closer to the truth about Gertrud's fate.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

The agent is instructed to turn in the opposite direction of their left, which is to the right. Part 4: \\"thrice\\" Usage: THRICE. This means that the previous action (turning right) should be performed three times. In this case, the agent would execute I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, and I_TURN_RIGHT, totaling 270 degrees to the right. The correct sequence of actions for the command \\"look right and turn opposite left thrice\\" would be: I_LOOK_RIGHT, AND, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT.

Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed.

He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: CHICAGO --- HIV has a voracious sweet tooth, which turns out to be its Achilles' heel, reports a new study from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University.      After the virus invades an activated immune cell, it craves sugar and nutrients from the cell to replicate and fuel its wild growth throughout the body.      Scientists discovered the switch that turns on the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline. Then they blocked the switch with an experimental compound, shutting down the pipeline, and, thereby, starving HIV to death. The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro.      The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread.      The study will be published May 28 in PLOS Pathogens.      \\"This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,\\" said corresponding study author, Harry Taylor, research assistant professor in medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.      \\"It's essential to find new ways to block HIV growth, because the virus is constantly mutating,\\" said Taylor, also a scientist at Northwestern Medicine's HIV Translational Research Center. \\"A drug targeting HIV that works today may be less effective a few years down the road, because HIV can mutate itself to evade the drug.\\"      HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood. Activation increases the T cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth.      Until now, no one knew the first step that signaled a newly activated T cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow.      Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that first step in stocking the T cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline.      This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth. A related approach was attempted in the 1990s but the drugs used sometimes killed healthy cells and had serious side effects in HIV patients.      The Northwestern team's new approach is a gentler, non-toxic way to block HIV access to the cell's \\"pantry.\\"      New strategy could reduce organ damage      The approach has additional benefits beyond the initial goal of preventing HIV from reproducing.      The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found. Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV.      The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients -- even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines.      \\"Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,\\" Taylor said.      HIV's hunt for sugar and world domination      When HIV enters the bloodstream, it searches out active CD4+ T cells, the commanders-in-chief of the immune system. These active cells are already responding to other pathogens or allergens in the blood and are guzzling glucose and amino acids from the blood, which they need to churn out the building blocks of DNA. The cells' factories are at full throttle, making these building blocks to produce an army of soldiers to fight that cold that has just started to give you a sore throat or the chills.      When HIV finds an active CD4+ T cell, it hijacks the cell's glucose supply and factory to build millions of copies of itself and invade other cells.      \\"It's a monster that invades the cell and says 'feed me!' \\" Taylor said. \\"It usurps the entire production line.\\"      Cancer cells crave sugar, too      The idea to test this compound for HIV evolved from Taylor's relationship with chemists at Vanderbilt University, where he was on faculty before he joined Northwestern in 2012.      Taylor knew his Vanderbilt colleagues had identified a compound in their massive screening for potential drugs that block the growth of breast cancer cells. The compound stopped breast cancer cells from spreading by blocking PLD1. Taylor and his Vanderbilt colleagues wondered if blocking this same enzyme in the CD4+ T cell would cut off HIV's use of the cell's nutrient supply and slow the invading HIV.      That's exactly what their study shows. In vitro, the compound shut off the glucose and other nutrients and prevented HIV from having enough building blocks of DNA to make the genetic material it needed to reproduce.      Now, Taylor wants to identify even more compounds for development into future medicines that will limit re-stocking of the cell's pantry to starve HIV -- without harming cells.      \\"This discovery opens new avenues for further research to solve today's persisting problems in treating HIV infection: avoiding virus resistance to medicines, decreasing the inflammation that leads to premature aging, and maybe even one day being able to cure HIV infection,\\" said Dr. Richard D'Aquila, director of Northwestern's HIV Translational Research Center. He also is the Howard Taylor Ricketts Professor of Medicine at Feinberg and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.      #      Key Vanderbilt collaborators are Craig W. Lindsley and H. Alex Brown.

At Vanderbilt University and Northwestern Medicine’s HIV Translational Research Center, scientists unlocked the switch that turns HIV’s sugar and nutrient source on and off, finally halting its wild growth.      \\"It's a monster that invades the cell and says 'feed me!'\\" the study’s co-author, Harry Taylor, a professor and scientist at Northwestern Medicine, said in a press release. \\"It usurps the entire production line. This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today.\\"      The idea for the study, which was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens, was based off of a discovery Taylor and his colleagues made in 2012 at Vanderbilt University that found breast cancer hijacks the body’s sugar source. When they cut off its source by blocking a part of the cell called phospholipase D1, researchers were able to stop the breast cancer cells from spreading. They thought they could starve HIV the same way — and they were right.      \\"This discovery opens new avenues for further research to solve today's persisting problems in treating HIV infection: avoiding virus resistance to medicines, decreasing the inflammation that leads to premature aging, and maybe even one day being able to cure HIV infection,\\" Dr. Richard D'Aquila, director of Northwestern's HIV Translational Research Center, said in a statement.      When HIV is introduced into the bloodstream, it targets and attacks CD4+ T cells, which are active immune cells in charge of responding to danger. When allergies hit, for example, the CD4+ T cells feed off of sugar (glucose) and amino acids in the blood, which are used to build an army of soldiers to repair and protect the body. HIV needs to grow inside of CD4+ T cells, so it ultimately steals the cells’ sugar source in order to create an army of its own that eventually attacks other cells in the body.      Because of this, HIV patients suffer from premature organ damage and excess inflammation that researchers believe is caused by the abnormal immune cell growth. Currently, HIV medications are limited with middling success, because they can stop the HIV growth itself but are unable to slow the immune system’s reaction to HIV. However, not only was the research team able to stop HIV from replenishing its army with the cells' stores of sugar, but they did so without harming other cells.      \\"Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,\\" Taylor said. \\"It's essential to find new ways to block HIV growth, because the virus is constantly mutating. A drug targeting HIV that works today may be less effective a few years down the road, because HIV can mutate itself to evade the drug.\\"      Source: Taylor H and D’Aquila R. PLOS Pathogens. 2015. |||||Summary:","output":"HIV is a dangerous virus because it loves sugar and grows very fast once it gets inside a person's body. When a person gets sick, their body's immune cells need sugar to help fight against whatever is making the person sick. But when HIV gets into a person's body, it steals the sugar from the immune cells and uses it to make more of itself. This makes it hard for the body to fight against HIV. Scientists have discovered a way to stop HIV from taking sugar from the immune cells. They found a special switch inside the cells that turns on the flow of sugar, and they shut it off so that HIV can't get to the sugar. This stops the virus from growing and will help people fight against it. This discovery is important because it can help make new medicines that can treat HIV. HIV is very good at changing itself to hide from medicines, so scientists need to find new ways to fight against it. This new way of stopping HIV from stealing sugar is a very promising way to help people who have the virus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a news article: (CNN) -- He had been on the run for four decades. He escaped from prison when Richard Nixon was in the White House, joined the Black Liberation Army in Detroit, hijacked a plane and (in)famously demanded that FBI agents deliver ransom money in bathing suits. And they did.      Now, after a manhunt spanning three continents that often appeared to run cold, the FBI has finally found George Wright.      At age 68, he was living quietly in the resort of Sintra near Lisbon in Portugal when he was arrested Monday.      The United States is seeking his extradition from Portugal to serve the remainder of a 15- to 30-year sentence for murder. Portuguese judicial authorities could not be reached Tuesday for details of the extradition process.      Wright is fighting extradition, a U.S. federal agent said, and his next court appearance in Portugal is in about two weeks.      Wright's life story reads like an international crime novel. In 1962, at the age of 19, he and three associates carried out a series of robberies in New Jersey. Wright and another man shot and killed a World War II veteran in a gas station robbery in Farmingdale.      He was arrested soon afterward and, after pleading no defense, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison. But in 1970, Wright escaped from Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, reportedly stealing the warden's car to make his getaway.      Wright made his way to Detroit, then a hotbed of militant black politics, and joined the Black Liberation Army. (He is also reputed to have made some money during this period as a part-time model, using an alias.)      On July 31, 1972, Wright and four other members of the Black Liberation Army went to Detroit airport and boarded Delta Flight 841 for Miami. Wright was dressed as a priest and carried a handgun in a hollowed-out Bible.      Airport security was different in those days. Various Palestinian groups were hijacking planes regularly, as were individuals keen to go to Cuba. Altogether, the U.S. Department of Transportation recorded 364 hijackings worldwide between 1968 and 1972: more than one a week on average.      The hijackers of Delta 841 -- three men and two women accompanied by three children -- seized the plane as it approached Miami. The FBI says \\"subsequent investigation identified Wright as one of the hijackers.\\"      Once on the ground, the hijackers demanded that FBI agents dressed only in bathing suits deliver 1 million ransom to the plane. They wanted to be sure the agents were not carrying guns. The money was duly delivered by the scantily clad agents.      The hijackers allowed the 88 passengers off but kept the flight crew on board and ordered that the plane fly to Boston. With the addition of an extra navigator (wearing swim trunks and a shirt), the DC-8 was refueled there and flew on to Algiers.      Algeria in the early 1970s was run by a hard-line socialist government that was no friend of the United States and allowed various dissidents, militants and alleged terrorists to take sanctuary there. A leading member of the Black Panthers, Eldridge Cleaver, had been welcomed as a political refugee there in 1968 after jumping bail in California.      The Algerian government confiscated and returned the 1 million in ransom money to the U.S., but Wright and his associates melted away. Some of the hijackers were arrested in Paris in 1976, but for decades, there was no trace of Wright.      Then, nine years ago, a fugitive investigator with the New Jersey Department of Corrections working with the U.S. Marshals Service got a lead. Officials won't comment on reports that Wright had begun to contact relatives in the United States.      Juan Mattos, U.S. marshal for the District of New Jersey, said: \\"Over the course of nine years, their tenacious resolve has proven to be very powerful in seeking justice and closure for the victims.\\"      And in a press release Tuesday, Michael Ward of the FBI's Newark Division said the case should \\"serve notice that the FBI's determination in pursuing subjects will not diminish over time or distance.\\"      At the time of the hijacking, there was limited screening of passengers at U.S. airports. This screening system did not require every passenger to be examined, only those who met a profile established by the Federal Aviation Administration.      After the Algiers flight and several hijackings that turned violent, the Nixon administration instructed the FAA to adopt emergency regulations to improve screening. At the end of 1972, the FAA ordered airports to ensure that all passengers and their carry-on baggage be inspected before boarding.      CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this report. ||||| A convicted killer who escaped a New Jersey prison in 1970 and hijacked a U.S. airliner two years later while dressed as a priest has been captured in Portugal after more than 40 years as a fugitive, authorities said Tuesday.      This arrest photo taken Feb. 15, 1963 and provided by the New Jersey Department of Corrections shows George Wright while in custody for the 1962 murder of a gas station owner in Wall, N.J. Wright was... (Associated Press)      George Wright was arrested Monday by Portuguese authorities in a town near Lisbon at the request of the U.S. government, the head of the FBI's New Jersey office said.      Wright was convicted of the 1962 murder of a gas station owner in Wall, N.J. Authorities say Wright and three associates had already committed multiple armed robberies on Nov. 23, 1962, when he and another man shot and killed Walter Patterson, a decorated World War II veteran and father of two, during a robbery of the Collingswood Esso gas station in Wall.      He received a 15- to 30-year sentence and had served eight years when he and three other men escaped from the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, N.J., on Aug. 19, 1970.      The FBI says Wright became affiliated with an underground militant group, the Black Liberation Army, and in 1972 he and his associates hijacked a Delta Air Lines flight from Detroit to Miami _ and on to Algeria.      The group lived as a \\"communal family\\" together in Detroit before the hijacking, according to Associated Press reports at the time.      News reports said Wright, then 29, dressed as a priest and used the alias the Rev. L. Burgess to board Delta Air Lines Flight 841 on July 31, 1972, accompanied by three men, two women and three small children.      When the plane landed at the Miami airport, the hijackers demanded a 1 million ransom _ the highest of its kind at the time _ to free the 86 people on board. After an FBI agent delivered the money, the passengers were released, according to AP accounts.      The hijackers then forced the plane to Boston, where an international navigator was taken aboard, and the group flew on to Algeria, where the hijackers sought asylum.      The group was taken in by Eldridge Cleaver, the American writer and activist, who had been permitted by Algeria's Socialist government to open an office of the Black Panther Movement in that country in 1970, after the Algerian president at the time professed sympathy for what he viewed as worldwide liberation struggles.      Algerian officials returned the plane and the money to the U.S. at the request of the American government, and briefly detained the hijackers before letting them stay. Coverage of the hijackers' stay in Algeria said their movements were restricted, and the president ignored their calls for asylum and requests to return them the ransom money.      Wright's associates were eventually tracked down, arrested, tried and convicted in Paris in 1976.      Wright was the last remaining fugitive, and his case was among the top priorities when the New York-New Jersey Fugitive Task Force was formed in 2002, according to Michael Schroeder, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service. The Department of Corrections brought along all its old escape cases nine years ago when the task force began operating, Schroeder said.      The investigators started the case anew, he said, and for nine years never took a prolonged break from working on it.      They looked at reports from the 1970s, interviewed Wright's victims and the pilots of the plane he hijacked. They had age-enhanced sketches made and tried to track down any communications he may have made with family in the U.S.      The address in Portugal was one of several on a list of places they wanted to check out. But Schroeder said there was nothing about it that made it seem especially promising. \\"It was another box to get checked, so to speak,\\" he said.      That changed last week, when details started falling into place with the help of authorities there.      \\"They have a national ID registry,\\" he said. \\"They pulled that. That confirmed his print matched the prints with the DOC. The sketch matched the picture on his ID card.\\"      By the weekend, U.S. authorities were on a plane to Portugal. And Monday, Portuguese police staking out his home found him.      Schroeder said he has not been told what, if anything, Wright said when he was caught.      U.S. authorities are trying to have him sent back to New Jersey. Until then, he said, it's not clear whether U.S. law enforcers will be able to interview him.      ___      Associated Press writers Geoff Mulvihill in Trenton, N.J., and Associated Press News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.      ___      Follow Samantha Henry at http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"George Wright, a convicted killer who escaped a New Jersey prison in 1970 and hijacked a U.S. airliner two years later while dressed as a priest, was captured in Portugal after more than 40 years as a fugitive.

Act 3: - Dr. Harris, overwhelmed with guilt, decides to create a serum to neutralize the shrews' mutated DNA and hopefully reverse the horrific effects of her experiments. - In a race against time, the lab team must evade the bloodthirsty shrews while working together to develop the serum. - Ultimately, the team manages to synthesize the serum and deploy it using a drone to spray the antidote across the island. - The shrews, affected by the serum, revert back to their natural, non-cannibalistic state. Conclusion: - The island returns to normalcy, but Dr. Harris faces the consequences of her actions, both ethically and professionally. - The scientific community becomes more cautious about genetic experimentation, and tighter restrictions on such research are implemented. - Dr. Harris looks for ways to redeem herself, focusing on more ethical and humane methods of solving global issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who witnesses the attack? Title: Blood Beach Movie plot: In the opening scene, a woman named Ruth is walking her dog on Los Angeles, California's Venice Beach, and is suddenly pulled under the sand of the deserted beach by an unseen force. The woman's screams for help are heard by Harry Caulder, a harbor patrol officer who is swimming nearby. Harry reports Ruth's disappearance to two LAPD detectives, Royko and Piantadosi, who claim that without a body, there is little they can do. The next day, Ruth's estranged daughter, Catherine, arrives from San Francisco after Harry calls her regarding her mother's disappearance. Meanwhile, the mysterious and crazed Mrs. Selden, who resides in an abandoned section of the Santa Monica Amusement Pier, witnesses the attack and disappearance (and others throughout the film), but does not come forward. That night, while staying in Ruth's house, Catherine hears Ruth's dog barking on the beach near the location where Ruth disappeared. Catherine investigates and finds the dog beheaded, near a small sinkhole. Royko and Piantadosi, as well as Harry, are called to the scene, but police pathologist Dr. Dimitrious cannot accurately determine a cause of death for the dog. Royko and Piantadosi believe it to be the work of a serial killer, due to reports of other disappearances over the past few months. The next morning, a teenage girl is buried in the sand at the beach, and begins screaming. Her friends pull her out of the sand, only to see that her legs have been injured from an attack by an unseen creature. The police, led by Captain Pearson, begin an investigation by digging up various sections of the beach at night, but find nothing.

By 1934, Stefan has established an investment bank; in gratitude, he provides the capital that Nicole needs to set up her own business and become a successful dress designer (though she insists on paying him back). British diplomat Anthony Wayne romances Nicole and wins her heart.

However, it's essential to consider both options thoughtfully and strike a balance to make a well-informed decision for everyone involved. Here's a detailed approach that may help you in this situation: 1. Consider the things that you are envisioning for your life: a. Long-term Goals: Examine your long-term goals and aspirations in terms of career, personal development, and relationships. By evaluating your long-term objectives, you can better understand which girl aligns better with your plans and can support you in achieving your goals. b. Personal Values: It's crucial to identify and understand the core values you hold dearly. Consider which girl shares similar values, as this often means a higher compatibility level. Those values may include honesty, integrity, loyalty, family values, or spiritual beliefs. c. Lifestyle Preferences: Think about your preferred lifestyle and what you enjoy doing in your leisure time. Which girl has similar interests, hobbies, and habits that harmonize with yours? Spending life with someone who shares a similar lifestyle can be more enjoyable and fulfilling. d. Emotional Compatibility: Emotional compatibility is an essential factor in long-lasting relationships. Determine which girl understands and fulfills your emotional needs and with whom you can connect and communicate effectively. 2. Think about which one is immediately pleasing to your gut instinct: a. Natural Chemistry: Sometimes, despite ticking all the compatibility checkboxes, relationships lack the natural chemistry that holds them together. In this case, pay attention to your gut instinct and evaluate which girl you feel more naturally drawn to and genuinely excited about being around. b. Support System: Consider each girl's ability to be a support system for you when you're experiencing tough times. Your gut instinct can be a good indicator of who would be more supportive and understanding during difficult moments. c. Emotional Attraction: Emotional attraction is a vital factor in determining the success of a relationship. Trust your gut instinct about which girl you feel emotionally attracted to and can see forming a deep bond with over time. d. Individual Growth: Reflect on which girl encourages your personal growth and is willing to grow together with you as a couple. It is crucial to choose someone who not only supports your individual progress but also shares the commitment to strengthen the relationship over time. While it may be tempting to rely solely on your gut instinct, it's essential to balance that instinct with careful and deliberate evaluations. Give equal importance to the things you envision for your life and the immediate reactions you have based on your instincts when deciding between the two girls pursuing you.

Beehive as a Hairstyle: The beehive is a woman's hairstyle in which long hair is piled up in a conical shape on the top of the head slightly resembling a beehive. It is also known as the B-52 due to a resemblance to the distinctive nose of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. Created by Illinois-based stylist Margaret Vinci Heldt in 1960, it remains one of the most recognizable and enduring hairstyles, becoming a symbol of 1960s fashion. 2. Beehive as a Wing of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings: The Beehive is the common name for the Executive Wing of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings, located at the corner of Molesworth Street and Lambton Quay, Wellington.

The pair met at the age of 15 at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, often compared to Veruca Salt, in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama in the mid and late 1990s and released two albums with the band on Tim/Kerr records.  - Art in Manila (formerly Art Bell) is an indie rock band consisting of Adrianne Verhoeven (The Anniversary), Dan McCarthy (McCarthy Trenching), Steve Bartolomei (Mal Madrigal), Ryan Fox (The Good Life), Corey Broman (Dance Me Pregnant), and Stefanie Drootin (The Good Life) led by a former member of Azure Ray, Orenda Fink. They are currently signed to Saddle Creek Records.  - The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.   - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Set the Woods on Fire is the first full - length studio album from indie rock band Art in Manila .  - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Orenda Fink (born September 18, 1975) is an American musician on Saddle Creek Records.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Answer: The answer is:","output":"Tigers hunt alone because they are big eaters and need to catch a large number of animals to sustain themselves. If they lived in big groups, they would not be able to find enough animals to feed them all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the word \\"break\\" mean the same thing in \\"He finally got his big break.\\" and \\"It was presented without commercial breaks.\\"?","output":"No, the word \\"break\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In the sentence, \\"He finally got his big break,\\" the word \\"break\\" means a good opportunity or a chance for someone to become successful. It's like when a kid gets a chance to perform at a big talent show or gets picked to be on a great sports team. In the sentence \\"It was presented without commercial breaks,\\" the word \\"break\\" means a short pause or interruption. A commercial break is when a show or program stops for a few minutes so the television station can play advertisements. So, in this sentence, it means the show went on without any interruptions for commercials. It's like when you are watching your favorite cartoon, and it stops for a few minutes so they can show some toy commercials before the cartoon comes back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Soil is a natural, living ecosystem comprising of organic matter, minerals, living organisms, and water. It is a fundamental component of the Earth's terrestrial ecosystem and supports life on the planet. The nutrients and chemical substances present in soil play a crucial role in nourishing plants, which in turn provide sustenance to the food chain. These chemical substances include essential macronutrients and micronutrients that are vital for the growth and development of plants and, subsequently, the food chain. Organic matter in the soil consists of decaying plants, animals, and microorganisms, which provide key nutrients and chemical substances such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. These elements are present in various forms and compounds, and they facilitate numerous biological and biochemical processes essential for life. In addition to the macronutrients mentioned above, plants and other living beings require micronutrients to thrive. Some of these micronutrients include iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, and chloride. Micronutrients are needed in smaller quantities as compared to macronutrients, but they play a substantial role in the overall growth and wellbeing of living organisms. Soil is teeming with life and is home to millions of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and protozoa that participate in nutrient cycling and decomposition of organic matter. These microorganisms, in turn, are consumed by other organisms, thus becoming a part of the food chain. Earthworms, insects, and other invertebrates living in the soil also contribute to nutrient cycling by breaking down organic matter into simpler compounds that can be easily absorbed by plant roots. The quality and composition of soil have a direct impact on the food chain. Rich, nutrient-dense soil provides a healthy foundation for plant growth and supports a diverse and balanced ecosystem, which benefits the entire food chain from primary producers (plants and algae) to higher-level consumers (herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores). As plants take up nutrients from the soil and convert them into edible biomolecules (such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids), these molecules are consumed by animals, transferring the nutrients along the food chain. This continuous transfer and transformation of nutrients significantly influence the health and productivity of ecosystems worldwide. In conclusion, soil is an essential component for sustaining life on Earth, as it contains vital chemical substances found in every living thing. The nutrients present in soil are critical for the growth and survival of plants and eventually enter the food chain. Through the process of nutrient cycling and energy transfer, the nutrients and chemical substances in soil play a significant role in maintaining the balance of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: And a focus on pure politics is surely better than a focus on personal misbehavior or the issue of whether evangelical Christians should be alone with women not their wives. Sentence 2: Ignoring personal misbehavior to focus only on politics is a bad idea. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment is a logical deduction or implication from one statement to another, meaning if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. However, in this case, the relationship between the two sentences is not one of entailment. The first sentence suggests that focusing on pure politics is better than concentrating on personal misbehavior or discussing the issue of whether evangelical Christians should be alone with women not their wives. It presents a preference or evaluation, asserting that it's more fruitful to deal with political matters rather than other aspects. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that ignoring personal misbehavior to solely focus on politics is a bad idea. This statement expresses an opinion against overlooking aspects related to personal conduct in favor of exclusively addressing political matters. The second sentence highlights a negative approach to such narrow focusing. While both sentences touch upon the balance between concentrating on politics and considering personal behavior or morality, they do not have a direct relation of entailment. The first sentence expresses that focusing on politics is \\"better,\\" but it does not suggest that personal misbehavior should be completely ignored. The second sentence explicitly states that ignoring personal behavior for the sake of politics is a bad idea, which is not the message of the first sentence. Therefore, one cannot logically deduce or imply the second sentence based solely on the truth of the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Il est prévu que la population diminuera de 20 % entre 1996 et 2050, mais le nombre de personnes âgées dépendant de la sécurité sociale devrait s'accroître de façon spectaculaire au cours des décennies à venir. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"It is predicted that the population will decrease by 20% between 1996 and 2050, but the number of elderly people dependent on social security is expected to grow dramatically in the coming decades. The above statement highlights the demographic changes that are expected to occur over a period spanning from 1996 to 2050. According to the prediction, there will be a significant decrease in the overall population, with a drop of 20%. This could be due to factors such as low birth rates, increased emigration, or higher mortality rates. However, despite the overall reduction in population, there is an expectation that the number of elderly individuals who rely on social security will see a substantial increase. This may be a result of multiple factors including, but not limited to, advancements in healthcare leading to longer lifespans, continuing improvements in living standards and quality of life, and potentially inadequate personal savings and retirement planning efforts by individuals. These demographic shifts will have wide-ranging implications for societies and economies, particularly in the areas of healthcare, social welfare, and employment. As the number of elderly people grows, there will be an increasing demand for healthcare services, long-term care, and specialized housing options. Governments may be pressured to allocate additional funding for services and programs designed to address the needs of an aging population, possibly leading to increased taxation or a redistribution of resources. At the same time, the workforce is expected to shrink due to the overall decrease in population. This reduced labor supply may result in shortages of skilled workers and could potentially limit economic growth. As a result, governments and businesses may need to implement policies and strategies to incentivize individuals to stay in the workforce longer or create pathways for new migrants to fill vacant positions and support economic growth. Furthermore, the escalating number of elderly people dependent on social security payments may place additional stress on public finances, leading to concerns about the long-term sustainability of social welfare systems. Governments may be forced to make tough decisions on the allocation of funds, possibly considering reforms to address the growing financial burden. Such reforms could include increasing the retirement age, adjusting the calculation of benefits, or raising contributions made by workers and employers. In conclusion, the anticipated decline in population and the concurrent growth of elderly individuals dependent on social security present significant challenges for societies and governments across the globe. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals will need to adapt to these demographic changes and work together to find solutions that promote economic stability, maintain social welfare programs, and support healthy and fulfilling lives for citizens of all ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: Area code 810 is the telephone area code serving eastern Michigan . Question: what area code is 810 A:","output":"Yes, area code 810 is indeed the telephone area code that serves eastern Michigan. It was first introduced on December 1, 1993, as a split from area code 313. The 810 area code comprises the cities of Flint, Lapeer, Port Huron, and several surrounding communities. Michigan's telephone area codes are part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), which is a group of standardized codes mainly used in the United States, Canada, and various Caribbean nations. These area codes were established with the objective of facilitating direct dialing of long-distance telephone calls. The NANP mainly divides three-digit area codes with a three-digit central office code, followed by a four-digit station code. The area code system has evolved significantly since its inception in the late 1940s, due in part to an increasing demand for telephone numbers. This increase is primarily attributed to the growth in telecommunications services and the subsequent need for more number assignments in specific regions. As a result, several new area codes have been introduced alongside existing ones to meet this demand for telephone services, such as the 810 area code in eastern Michigan. Area code 810 is currently one of twelve main area codes within Michigan, representing an important part of the state's telecommunications infrastructure. The region it covers includes several significant cities, such as Flint, Lapeer, and Port Huron. Flint, for instance, is the largest city within area code 810 and is known for both its manufacturing history and its presence in the automotive industry. Port Huron, on the other hand, is a smaller city located along the St. Clair River and is known for trade and transportation. Lapeer is another city in the 810 area code that holds historical significance, such as its origins as a lumber-producing town. In summary, area code 810 is the telephone area code serving eastern Michigan, which includes major cities such as Flint, Lapeer, and Port Huron. Established in 1993, this area code has become an integral part of eastern Michigan's telecommunications landscape, serving diverse communities and industries across the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine facts and answer this:  William Samoei arap Ruto served as the Acting President for a Kenyan politician who is currently a member of what party? A:","output":"William Samoei arap Ruto served as the Acting President for Uhuru Kenyatta, the incumbent Kenyan President, who is currently a member of the Jubilee Party.  Uhuru Kenyatta is the son of Kenya's founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, and was born on October 26, 1961, in Nairobi. He pursued his higher education in the United States, studying political science and economics at Amherst College. Prior to his presidency, Kenyatta held various other leadership positions, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. His entry into politics started in the early 2000s when he served as a nominated Member of Parliament. In 2002, Kenyatta ran his first presidential campaign as a candidate representing the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party. However, he lost the elections to Mwai Kibaki of the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). Over the years, Uhuru Kenyatta continued to gain prominence in Kenyan politics through his association with different political parties, including the National Alliance (TNA), which later formed a coalition with Ruto's United Republican Party (URP) to create the Jubilee Alliance. This alliance contributed to the formation of the Jubilee Party of Kenya. In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto successfully contested the Kenyan general elections, with Kenyatta being elected as Kenya's fourth president and Ruto as the Deputy President. In 2017, both politicians were re-elected for a second term under the banner of the newly-founded Jubilee Party. The Jubilee Party, which officially launched on September 10, 2016, emerged as an outcome of the merger of TNA, URP, and other smaller national parties. It is currently the ruling party in Kenya and aims to promote unity, development, and economic progress in the country. During their term in office, Kenyatta and Ruto have focused on implementing policies to improve economic growth, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and national security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting on line, sending e-mails, sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary. The article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day. I don't agree with this because I send e-mail only twice a week. However, I do check my e-mail once a day. I like receiving e-mails. About chatting online, the article says that chatting on line is becoming more and more popular among teenagers. I think this is true. Whenever I arrive at home, I turn on my computer and log on  to chat online with my friends. I prefer chatting online to calling a friend, because I can chat with many friends at the same time. But I like using mobile phones. When I do not have my computer with me I can send short massages to my friends. I also like keeping in touch with them in this way. I keep an online diary four times a week. I like telling others what has happened to me. I think I am one of the people living in the e-age. I can live without computers or mobile phones.

Then he appeared at CPAC, where he fueled the fire of conservatives calling for him to run for president in 2016: \\"Let's just say if you magically put me in the White House...\\" he said, to cheers. Carson, whose fame has exploded as his prayer breakfast speech went viral on YouTube, has no political background but quite a compelling story: He rose from poverty in Detroit to become director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, he has several books to his name, and Cuba Gooding Jr. once played him in a movie. His latest book, America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great, has sold 46,000 copies since the speech. Appearances on Fox News have bolstered his popularity. But Carson won't identify himself as a Republican, though his views have turned decidedly conservative since his \\"flaming liberal\\" days in college, he tells the New York Times. He's religious and supports a flat tax, in which someone who makes 10 billion pays 1 billion and someone who makes 10 pays 1. But not all Carson's views are popular with the GOP: The Daily Caller, which calls him \\"a conservative star on the rise,\\" reports that he did not support the invasions of either Iraq or Afghanistan. Expand this summary.","output":"Dr. Benjamin Carson, a highly-acclaimed pediatric neurosurgeon, gained significant attention among conservatives during the National Prayer Breakfast. At the event, he criticized ObamaCare with President Obama in attendance. His popularity further increased after his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he hinted at the possibility of running for president in 2016. Carson's fame has skyrocketed ever since his prayer breakfast speech went viral on YouTube, although he has no political background to speak of.  Dr. Carson's personal journey is indeed inspirational. He overcame poverty in Detroit and rose to prominence as the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. He has authored several books, one of which, \\"America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great,\\" has sold 46,000 copies since his speech. Cuba Gooding Jr. even portrayed Dr. Carson in a movie about his life. Dr. Carson's popularity has also been boosted by appearances on Fox News. Although Dr. Carson's views have become more conservative since his time as a \\"flaming liberal\\" in college, he does not identify as a Republican. He is known to be religious and is an advocate for a flat tax system, in which an individual making 10 billion would pay 1 billion in taxes, while someone making 10 would pay 1 in taxes. Interestingly, not all of Dr. Carson's views align with the GOP. According to The Daily Caller, which describes him as \\"a conservative star on the rise,\\" Carson did not support the invasions of Iraq or Afghanistan. Despite his lack of political experience, Dr. Benjamin Carson's remarkable story, his recent rise in popularity, and his outspoken stance on various political issues have led to calls from conservatives for him to run for the U.S. presidency in 2016. Although it remains to be seen whether he will pursue a political career, Carson's avid supporters undoubtedly hope that his unique perspective and life experience could bring positive change to the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A court found in December last year the Chinpo Shipping Company was in breach of the UN sanctions on North Korea. The company paid a Panamanian shipping agent 72,000 (£50,000) for the passage of North Korean ship the Chong Chon Gang through the Panama Canal. The arms shipment was hidden under more than 10,000 tonnes of sugar. The Chong Chon Gang was stopped while navigating the Panama Canal, by officials who suspected it was being used to smuggle drugs. Cuba said it had shipped the weaponry to North Korea for repair. It did not explain why it was hidden under a cargo of sugar. Chinpo was also fined S100,000 for operating a remittance business without a license, for performing hundreds of remittances, worth tens of millions of dollars, on behalf of North Korean entities. During the trial, the prosecution said the company often did not provide relevant names or documents when carrying out transactions, in a bid to obscure the counterparties involved. The arms included disassembled radar systems, missiles, MiG fighter jets and engines, many of which dated from the Soviet era - something the shipping company attempted to use in its defence, arguing they were \\"obsolete\\". The defence also claimed the aircraft were intended for training, not battlefield use, although training weapons are also covered by the sanctions Chinpo director Tan Cheng Hoe, also cited what he said were his well-known connections to North Korea, stretching back decades, as evidence that he and his company were not trying to hide their dealings with Pyongyang, dubbed \\"proliferation finance\\" by experts. He claimed that omitting such details was a common way to speed up money transfer times. Both Singapore-based Chinpo Shipping and Pyongyang-based Ocean Maritime Management (OMM), which operated the seized ship, have been named by the UN as entities involved in shipping North Korean arms. Under United Nations sanctions, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as it is formally known, is banned from weapons exports and the import of all but small arms. The Panama incident was the largest seizure of arms going to or from North Korea since the UN began its current sanctions on the country in 2006, said the Singapore District Court judge.","output":"A shipping company called Chinpo Shipping got in trouble for secretly helping a North Korean ship carry weapons, which is not allowed by the United Nations, and now they have to pay a big fine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grunge guitarists \\"flatly rejected\\" the virtuoso \\"shredding\\" guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs, instead opting for melodic, blues-inspired solos – focusing \\"on the song, not the guitar solo\\". Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill. In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had \\"guitar anti-heroes\\" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument.In Will Byers' article \\"Grunge committed a crime against music—it killed the guitar solo\\", in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge. He states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement. The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana \\"killed the guitar solo\\". Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the \\"death of the guitar solo\\"; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? The floor is the part of the room that is most likely to show wear and tear. Once of the best ways to refresh a room is to install new flooring. If you’ve had carpet before, consider changing to hardwood or laminate floors.  If you choose carpet, make sure it reflects your lifestyle. For example, white carpet probably isn’t a wise choice if you have small children or a playful puppy. Visit a flooring store to look at samples and get a feel for what materials cost. For example, laminate is less expensive than actual hardwood. You could compare the 2 to see what works for you. Painting is probably the easiest way to give a room new life. For a bedroom, try to stick with cool tones such as blue. This will create a soothing environment. Feel free to be creative in your living space. For example, you could have a gray room with 1 red wall to create a dramatic accent. Whether you’re looking for a new dining table or an updated sofa, furniture will help make your newly redone room feel like home. Spend time browsing design magazines to get a sense of what you like. If you’re working with a designer, provide them with plenty of clippings before they shop.  For the kitchen, look at tables, storage racks, and bar stools. You might price couches, end tables, and lamps for your living room. For the bedroom, consider headboards, dressers, and nightstands. You might want a new table or buffet for the dining room. Your furniture should fit your lifestyle. For example, if you have a large family, consider a long dining table with a bench on 1 side to accommodate several people. If you and your partner love movie night, a comfy sofa might be your priority. the room for an easy update. If you don’t have the budget for a complete remodel, add accessories to any room for an easy update. In the living room, add new picture frames, lamps, and area rugs. You could add a new end table to your bedroom.  For your dining room, you might display decorative plates on the walls. To jazz up your table, add new place mats and napkins. Mirrors are a great way to make a small room look larger. To fill a large room, consider purchasing some oversize pieces, such as a long table or sectional sofa. Harsh overhead lights can make a room feel less homey. Try adding several table and floor lamps to a room to make it feel more welcoming. You can also add a chandelier or pendant to give your room an interesting new focal point.

Summarize the following: If it is malfunctioning, or is a sand-bed filter, backwash cleaning methods could have damaged the filtration media. It is essential to continue pool maintenance, and any malfunction should be treated seriously.  Check the lines and filtration media before deciding what to replace. Vacuum any loose debris, scrub the sides and floor with a brush, and vacuum any loosened detritus. Run the pool filter for 8-12 hours to remove any flotsam and detritus that might be clouding the pool. Loose colloidal particles cause cloudiness. They are either organic in nature (like algae) or mineral buildups (loose calcium). Adjust the chemicals to these ranges and run the pool filter system for another day before re-testing.  Free chlorine: 1-2 ppm Combined chlorine: <.3ppm pH: 7.2 – 7.8 Total alkalinity: 80 – 120 ppm Calcium hardness: 180 – 220 ppm (higher levels are acceptable up to approximately 400ppm) Do not attempt to mix strong acids or bases in your pool or without eye and skin protection and respirators. Combined chlorine is free chlorine that has reacted with an agent in the water to form chloramine, which produces a strong chlorine scent. Pool shock kits should raise the chlorine to over 30ppm.  If your pH test kit uses litmus paper and produces a purple or off color, this may be due to high levels of chlorine. Test kits often have a reagent, typically thiosulfate, that will remove the chlorine and enable an accurate test. High levels of cyanuric acid can reduce chlorine’s efficacy as a sterilizing agent and can be reduced with dilution. High variance day-to-day indicates a chlorine demand problem. Monitor cyanuric acid levels, which acts as a stabilizer for chlorine to prevent UV degradation, and consider investigating your chlorinator or investing in one to ease the process of keeping your pool stable. Add them according to the directions on the package according to the volume of your pool. The solutions should be dispersed and accomplished their chemical reactions within six hours of treatment. You can also use dilution with softer water to soften the water. These are agglomerating solutions that work best in slightly alkaline water, and take several days for the full effect to be observed.  The hardness of local water resources varies tremendously from area to area, and the strength and dilution of these products can be recommended by pool cleaning professionals. Clarifiers are agglomerating solutions that bind to colloids from the water and bring them out of suspension, to be removed by vacuum or through the filter. These chemicals are called flocculents, and the process is referred to as flocculation.  Continue filtering for without interruption until the water clears. and continue to run your filtration system if the pool has not cleared. Keep in mind that too much clarifier will actually work against the clarifying process; particles will repel one another rather attract, and the concentration of the clarifier will increase. Follow label instructions to the letter. Do not repeat more often than 2 additional times over the course of one week. Discoloration, buildup, or rust, is likely the result of water hardness or alkalinity changes, rather than the flocculent. Multiple treatments failing generally indicates a secondary, unseen problem that can be detected and treated most effectively and safely by a professional. Multiple cleanings can cause skin and mucous membrane irritation for swimmers. Make sure any cleaning hardware is not malfunctioning.","output":"In case of a malfunctioning or sand-bed filter, backwash cleaning might damage the filtration media.

Write a text based on \\"netanyahu hints israel would be flexible in talks with syria\\" Text:","output":"Title: Netanyahu Hints at Israel's Flexibility in Talks with Syria In recent developments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted at the possibility of Israel being more flexible in its approach to negotiations with Syria. This suggestion comes amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East, specifically regarding the long-standing disputes over territorial rights and regional stability. In an effort to alleviate some of these issues, Netanyahu emphasized the need for ongoing discussions between both nations. By conveying a willingness to be flexible in the negotiation process, Israel aims to facilitate a more constructive dialogue and foster a conducive atmosphere for reaching an agreement. Throughout the history of the relationship between these two neighboring countries, discussions have predominantly revolved around the Golan Heights – a strategically important area that was captured by Israel during the Six-Day War of 1967. The status of this region has been a persisting point of contention between both nations, and any progress in negotiations would likely involve concessions from Israel, given that it currently occupies this territory. It's worth noting that the present situation in the Middle East continues to be highly volatile, with multiple factions exercising influence. As such, any agreement reached between Israel and Syria would need to take into account various stakeholders, including the United States, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, among others. The statement by Netanyahu demonstrates Israel's commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to these decades-long issues. This newfound flexibility could be a stepping-stone to reach a middle ground, paving the way for a sustainable truce between the two nations. Consequently, it may ultimately result in a more stable and secure Middle East. However, it is crucial that both Israel and Syria engage in meaningful dialogue and demonstrate mutual respect and understanding to find a viable solution to their disputes. While Netanyahu's hint at flexibility is a positive indicator, it should be seen as merely the first step in a potentially long and challenging process to restore peace and stability in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average  temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers   in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles   rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes  , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting   for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days.

The now orphaned M'Liss is left in the guardianship of her father's friends, gambler Lou Ellis and the town barber Alf Edwards. When the mayor's wife Delia disapproves of M'Liss and tries to have her placed in an orphanage, M'Liss decides to leave Smith's Pocket. Stephen kisses M'Liss to persuade her not to run away.

Article: It's true that many dads in the wild aren't interested in parenting, but there are some that work pretty hard to give their little ones a good start. Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches. For about 62 to 67 days, the egg stays on top of the father's feet, in very cold temperatures that drop down to -39deg C.

Detectives are reporting a massive rise in the number of reported child abuse linked to witchcraft, they said today. Scotland Yard has received 27 allegations of ritual child abuse this year alone - a dramatic increase on a decade ago, when just two such cases were reported to police in the whole of 2004. Examples of the faith-based abuse include a child being dunked in a bath to 'wash away evil spirits', children being raped, and a pastor swinging a child around banging its head to 'drive out the devil'. Now teachers, social workers and doctors are to be taught to spot the signs of the abuse in a drive to tackle the growing problem across Britain. Police say witchcraft-based child abuse is on the rise - this shows an alleged exorcism ceremony in a suburban street in south London last month. Last month police were called to a leisure centre in south London after residents reported a string of dawn 'child exorcisms' in which adults surrounded a toddler chanting 'Get the demon out'. A number of child killings have been linked to these beliefs, including the murder of Kristy Bamu, 15, who was tortured and drowned by his sister and her boyfriend in 2010; and the death of Victoria Climbie. The number of cases of ritualistic or faith-based abuse of children reported to Scotland Yard has increased year-on-year over the past decade.  But detectives believe the number of reports is just the tip of the iceberg, with many more such cases being kept secret among communities. Police and child protection experts have now created a training film for all front-line professionals who work with children to teach them how to recognise the signs that a child may be suffering, or likely to suffer harm from witchcraft. The DVD will be launched at a conference on the subject in London today, organised by the Met police and the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service (CCPAS), before being distributed to those in the force area who work with children who may be affected. Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Met's Project Violet which tackles faith-based child abuse, said: 'Abuse linked to belief is a horrific crime which is condemned by people of all cultures, communities and faiths. 'Families or carers genuinely believe that the victim has been completely taken over by the devil or an evil spirit, which is often supported by someone who within the community has portrayed themselves as an authority on faith and belief.' This alleged exorcism ceremony, performed on the street in south London, did not involve children but police say child abuse linked to faith-based rituals is on the rise and professionals must learn to recognise the signs. 'But regardless of the beliefs of the abusers, child abuse is child abuse and it is important that professional are clear about the signs to look for.' At the event at City Hall, detectives will debate with teachers, social workers and healthcare professionals to discuss how to tackle what is now a growing problem in Britain. In 2004 just two such cases were reported to Scotland Yard.  By 2009 it had risen to seven, and by 2012 it had risen again to 19. Among this year's 27 reports of such abuse, cases included a child forced to drink unknown substances to 'rid them of evil spirits' and parents removing their children from school and taking them abroad to attend an 'exorcism' ceremony. One case has already resulted in an arrest for rape, and another in a charge of rape being brought. Previous cases dealt with by Scotland Yard include a child having chillies rubbed into its eyes to 'remove an evil spirit' and being cut with a knife for the same reason. Extreme cases have seen children killed as a result of these rituals. In 2000 Victoria Climbié, an eight year old originally from the Côte d'Ivoire who lived in Haringey, north London, was tortured and murdered by her guardians who believed she was possessed by an evil spirit. The belief, which was supported by their church leaders, led to her being beaten, burned with cigarettes, and forced to sleep in a bin liner in a bath before she was killed. Victoria Climbié, eight, and Kristy Bamu, 15, were murdered by relatives who thought they were possessed. Victoria's aunt and adoptive mother, Marie Therese Kouao, then 44, and her boyfriend Carl Manning, 28, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for Victoria's murder. In 2010, 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was tortured and beaten before he drowned in a bath at his sister's flat in east London after his sister and her boyfriend became convinced he was possessed by 'kindoki', or witchcraft, and was trying to harm or control another child in the family. Magalie Bamu, then 29, and her partner Eric Bikubi, 28, were jailed for life in 2012 after they were convicted of Kristy's murder. And in 2001, the torso of a young boy, named Adam by police, was found floating in the Thames.  It is believed he may have been the victim of a ritual sacrifice practised in parts of Africa. Simon Bass from the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service said: 'We are not remotely surprised that the Metropolitan Police alone has already received 27 referrals of this type this year - or three a month. 'We are pleased that the Metropolitan Police has undertaken such great work in this area, but we are convinced that this form of abuse is hidden, and that the statutory agencies across the UK are facing similar situations.' Abuse survivor Kevani Kanda said: 'Mass migration has made this a pervasive problem worldwide, and it is not confined to cities or areas where there are large migrant communities. 'Belief-related abuse can result in significant physical and emotional harm, neglect, sexual abuse and even death.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article discusses a significant rise in the number of reported child abuse cases linked to witchcraft and faith-based rituals in the UK, particularly in London. Scotland Yard has received 27 allegations of ritual child abuse this year, a stark increase compared to just two cases reported in 2004. Examples of such abuse include children being dunked in water, raped, or physically harmed to \\"drive out evil spirits\\" or the devil.

The increasing number of reported cases year-on-year highlights this as a growing problem in Britain. Two high-profile child murder cases mentioned in the article are the murder of Kristy Bamu, who was tortured and drowned by his sister and her boyfriend in 2010, and the death of Victoria Climbie.

News article: Transportation Emerges as Crucial to Escaping Poverty James Baker was pedaling to work along a slick, snow-covered road in Frederick County, Md., when a traffic light changed abruptly. He braked and skidded to the ground, unhurt but making a mess of his clothes before a long day of work and school. He was on his bicycle that snowy morning last December, about an hour northwest of Washington, because the bus service in Frederick was so erratic. Routes were far apart and the buses often late, making a 30-minute bike ride, whatever the weather, a better option. His commuting problems highlight a central theme for many low-income people trying to build a better life: A lack of reliable and efficient transportation is often a huge barrier. In a large, continuing study of upward mobility based at Harvard, commuting time has emerged as the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty. The longer an average commute in a given county, the worse the chances of low-income families there moving up the ladder. The impact of transportation on social mobility is stronger than several other factors, like crime, elementary-school test scores or the percentage of two-parent families in a community, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the researchers on the study. It notes the connection in places with notoriously long commutes and poverty including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Fla., and Birmingham, Ala. A separate report focusing on New York, from New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation, came to a similar conclusion. The study compared neighborhoods by accessibility to mass transit and the number of jobs within an hour’s commute. It found that residents of the areas least well-served by mass transit relied on personal vehicles. Areas in the middle third — those with some, but insufficient, access to transportation — had the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest incomes, the study found. For Mr. Baker and his fiancée, Andrea Zona, the lack of good transportation has been one of the few downsides of moving to Frederick County. He grew up in Washington and moved to the city of Frederick four years ago to study at Hood College, where he met Ms. Zona. Mr. Baker has worked at two 8-an-hour jobs — one as a lifeguard and another running a student activity room on campus — while interning at the Interfaith Housing Alliance. They live paycheck to paycheck, he said, with a little help from the state in the form of food stamps. Ms. Zona, who hails from northeast Pennsylvania, volunteers and works a 15-an-hour job in an archaeological laboratory. She hopes to get a job as a volunteer coordinator for AmeriCorps, a national organization focused on community service. Eight months ago she gave birth to their son, Quinn. “We’re working our way up in life,” said Mr. Baker, who has lined up a job coordinating financial classes with AmeriCorps after graduation. The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment, which costs 900 a month — a rent that would require them to live in a rougher neighborhood in Washington, where he said he wouldn’t want to raise his son. “You don’t have to worry about getting hurt at night in Frederick, compared to the way I would be living in D.C.,” Mr. Baker said. The couple feels that the town offers Quinn a bright future and that Frederick’s school system will set him on a better path. “I want him to have a better education than I had,” Mr. Baker said. The data from the Harvard study supports Mr. Baker’s hopes. It has tracked more than five million people who moved as children during the 1980s and 1990s and controlled for a variety of factors in an effort to isolate the way that a place affects children. The researchers concluded that Washington is roughly an average place for a lower-income child to grow up — but that Frederick is above average. Children who have previously moved from an average place to Frederick end up earning about 8 percent more as adults than similar children who did not move. Moreover, the younger a child is in such an above-average place, the more impact that place has on future earnings and other factors of social mobility. Frederick does not lift the odds of upward mobility quite so much as Washington’s closer-in suburbs, like Montgomery County, Md., or Fairfax, Va., — which have more expensive housing and better public transportation. But Mr. Baker and Ms. Zona seem to have solved, at least for now, their transportation problems. In January, they discovered a silver 2001 Toyota Corolla listed for 1,700 on the website of a local nonprofit, Second Chances Garage. Spotted with old stickers for Chicago sports teams, it has changed their daily routines. Commuting is easy, and they can now get to less expensive stores like Walmart and Target. “The car,” Mr. Baker said, “is the key to life in Frederick.” The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

It highlights the story of James Baker, a low-income individual who struggled with unreliable transportation options in Frederick County, Maryland. The article emphasizes that a lack of reliable and efficient transportation is often a significant barrier for many low-income people trying to improve their lives. According to a large, ongoing study at Harvard University, commuting time has emerged as the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty. Longer average commute times in a given county result in worse chances of low-income families moving up the ladder.

The article also mentions a report from New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation, which found that residents of areas with poor access to mass transit relied on personal vehicles, while those areas with some but insufficient access to transportation had the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest incomes. The story of Baker shows that even though he was able to secure low-paying jobs and a place to live, his lack of reliable transportation made it difficult for him to maintain those jobs and attend school. The lack of good transportation options was one of the few downsides of living in Frederick County for Baker and his fiancée, Andrea Zona. The couple eventually found a solution to their transportation problems by purchasing a used car, which greatly improved the ease of commuting and enabled them to access more affordable stores like Walmart and Target. In conclusion, transportation emerges as a crucial factor in escaping poverty due to its strong impact on social mobility, job prospects, and access to resources. Reliable transportation options can significantly improve the lives and opportunities of low-income individuals and their families."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Fazlur Rahman Khan (Bengali: phjlur rhmaan khaan, Fozlur Rohman Khan) (3 April 1929 - 27 March 1982) was a Bangladeshi-American structural engineer and architect, who initiated important structural systems for skyscrapers. Considered the \\"father of tubular designs\\" for high-rises, Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center. Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century. Context: Among Khan's other accomplishments, he received the Wason Medal (1971) and Alfred Lindau Award (1973) from the American Concrete Institute (ACI); the Thomas Middlebrooks Award (1972) and the Ernest Howard Award (1977) from ASCE; the Kimbrough Medal (1973) from the American Institute of Steel Construction; the Oscar Faber medal (1973) from the Institution of Structural Engineers, London; the International Award of Merit in Structural Engineering (1983) from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering IABSE; the AIA Institute Honor for Distinguished Achievement (1983) from the American Institute of Architects; and the John Parmer Award (1987) from Structural Engineers Association of Illinois and Illinois Engineering Hall of Fame from Illinois Engineering Council (2006).  Khan was cited five times by Engineering News-Record as among those who served the best interests of the construction industry, and in 1972 he was honoured with ENR's Man of the Year award. In 1973 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. He received Honorary Doctorates from Northwestern University, Lehigh University, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).  The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat named one of their CTBUH Skyscraper Awards the Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal after him, and other awards have been established in his honour, along with a chair at Lehigh University. Promoting educational activities and research, the Fazlur Rahman Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture honours Khan's legacy of engineering advancement and architectural sensibility. Dan Frangopol is the first holder of the chair.  Khan was mentioned by president Obama in 2009 in his speech in Cairo, Egypt when he cited the achievements of America's Muslim citizens.  Khan was the subject of the Google Doodle on April 3, 2017, marking what would have been his 88th birthday. Question: Did he win a Chair? Answer:","output":"Yes, Fazlur Rahman Khan won a special kind of chair called the \\"Fazlur Rahman Khan Endowed Chair of Structural Engineering and Architecture\\" at Lehigh University. This chair is not like a regular chair you sit on, but it's an important title that shows how great he was in his work.

Input: Passage: Despite the adversity they had gone through, the Pacers made the 2005 NBA Playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years. In the first round, Indiana defeated the Atlantic Division champion 2004-05 Boston Celtics season in seven games, winning Game 7 in Boston by the decisive margin of 97-70, just the third time the Celtics had dropped a Game 7 at home. The Pacers then advanced to the second-round against the 2004-05 Detroit Pistons season, in a rematch of the previous years Eastern Conference Finals. The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the scene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the Pacers season. After losing Game 1, the Pacers won the next two games to take a 2-1 lead. However, the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the Pistons and lost the next 3 games, losing the series 4-2. The final game (Game 6) was on May 19, 2005; Reggie Miller, in his final NBA game, scored 27 points and received a huge standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Millers effort, the Pacers lost, sending Miller into retirement without an NBA Finals in his 18-year career, all with the Pacers. Miller had his No. 31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30, 2006 when the Pacers played the Phoenix Suns.  Question: How many total games did the Pacers lose in the playoffs?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: King Crimson are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968. King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists. The band has undergone numerous formations throughout its history of which 21 musicians have been members; since October 2017 it has consisted of Robert Fripp, Jakko Jakszyk, Tony Levin, Mel Collins, Pat Mastelotto, Gavin Harrison, Jeremy Stacey and Bill Rieflin. Fripp is the only consistent member of the group and is considered the band's leader and driving force. After a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and Ian Wallace on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from Bryan Ferry and John Gaydon, the band's manager,. The position went to Raymond \\"Boz\\" Burrell. Bassist John Wetton was invited to join, but declined (at the time) in order to play with Family. Rick Kemp also declined an offer to join, leaving Fripp and Wallace teaching Burrell to play bass rather than continue auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument. With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.  In 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded Islands. Loosely influenced by Miles Davis's orchestral collaborations with Gil Evans and Homer's Odyssey, the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \\"Sailor's Tale\\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). Islands also featured the band's one-and-only experiment with a string ensemble on \\"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \\"Ladies of the Road\\". A hint of trouble to come came when one member of the band allegedly described the more delicate and meditative parts of Islands as \\"airy-fairy shit\\". Released in December 1971, Islands charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a period of touring Islands, Fripp asked Sinfield to leave the band, citing musical differences and a loss of faith in his partner's ideas. The remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals shortly afterward, owing to Fripp's refusal to incorporate other members' compositions into the band's repertoire. He later cited this as \\"quality control\\", with the idea that King Crimson would perform the \\"right kind\\" of music.  King Crimson reformed to fulfil touring commitments in 1972, with the intention of disbanding afterwards. Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as Earthbound in June 1972, noted and criticised for its sub-par sound quality and playing style that occasionally veered towards funk, with scat singing on the improvised pieces. By this time, a definite musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band existed, since Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured a more rhythm-and-blues style. Though personal relations improved during the 1972 tour (to the point where most of the band wished to continue), Fripp opted to part company with the existing band and to restructure King Crimson with new members, since he felt the current members wouldn't be able to play the new material he had in mind. Did they record any other albums during that time?","output":"Based on the information given in the text, King Crimson did record albums during that time. In 1971, they recorded the album \\"Islands\\" which was influenced by an array of sources and styles. The album incorporated softer jazz-folk approach and also harsher instrumental styles. A year later in 1972, they released \\"Earthbound\\", an album that was notable and criticized for its subpar sound quality and playing style that veered towards funk. It seems the band underwent a series of creative differences and changes in their musical direction during this period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We are trying to find the number that 'i' represents. So, we have: -52 * i = -71 * i - 186 + 53 First, let's add 71 * i to both sides of the equation. This helps us get the 'i' terms together: -52 * i + 71 * i = -186 + 53 Now, if we combine the terms on the left side, we have: 19 * i = -186 + 53 Next, we'll simplify the right side, by subtracting 53 from -186: 19 * i = -133 Now, we just need to find out what 'i' is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 19: i = -133 / 19 When we do the division, we get: i = -7 And there we have it! The number 'i' represents is -7, like finding the last piece of the puzzle.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the \\"Journal Editorial Report,\\" as the president unveils his gun control agenda, we'll look at the good, the bad and the probably unconstitutional. Plus, from immigration to deficit reduction, what else is on his second-term to-do list. And is compromise or confrontation the real goal? Plus, the suicide of an Internet activist has his family crying foul. Was Aaron Swartz a victim of government intimidation and a run-away federal prosecutor? PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: While there's no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try it. GIGOT: Welcome to the \\"Journal Editorial Report.\\" I'm Paul Gigot. That was President Obama rolling out the administration's plan to curb gun violence. The president outlined 23 executive actions, including steps to make more federal data available from background checks and increased access to mental health services. And he called on Congress to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban and prohibit high-capacity gun magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. So, what's likely to get passed and what difference will it make? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Political Diary editor, Jason Riley; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel. So, Dan, just as a hypothetical, let's assume that everything the president is proposing becomes law. What difference would it make? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, it's not quite a hypothetical, Paul. The president just said, if we can save just one life, if we have to do this. From 1994, to 2004, we had the law banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. The National Research Council and the Centers for Disease Control took a deep look at the effect of that law and their conclusion was it was impossible to determine whether it had reduced any crime in the United States. In 2005, the National Research Council looked again. Their conclusion was that the government's collection of data about guns is so poor, that it's impossible to understand whether any good is coming of these laws. You'd hate to reduce it to something as bureaucratic as the federal government's inability to track these guns, but that is about what it comes down to. There is just no evidence that those laws make any difference. JASON RILEY, POLITICAL DIARY EDITOR: In fact, Paul, gun violence has fallen since the assault weapons ban expired. GIGOT: In 2004 was it, I think? RILEY: In 2004. So, the relevant question is that these are proposals being put forward in response to Sandy Hook and gun violence overall in the country. So, will they address that problem? The universal background check would have been passed by the person who bought the gun used in Connecticut. GIGOT: Well, let me argue that some the things he's proposed on mental health, for example, easing the law called HIPAA, which is a federal privacy law, if you ease that and allow people, like administrators in schools or doctors and medical officers, to be able to share information when they see some kid who seems to be troubled, and identify him and maybe push him into assisted treatment, that kind of thing would help, seems to me. HENNINGER: It would definitely help. That side of it is the piece we haven't had much of a conversation about. GIGOT: It's almost like an afterthought. The president offered it, but may be the most effective. HENNINGER: But the Newtown events, the Virginia Techs, the sort of killing in the theaters in Colorado by these violently mentally ill people really is not related to gun control. It's about what you're describing, which is monitoring and ensuring that those people are taking their medication, and that's what's been a weak part of the system until perhaps now. RILEY: Let's also keep in mindless that than 3 percent of gun crimes in this country involve the assault weapons that the president wants to ban. GIGOT: Most of them are handguns actually. GIGOT: So why isn't he proposing then to ban handguns? If most people, who are victims of gun violence, are killed by handguns, why not ban handguns. HENNINGER: Because the banned guns, they are illegal on the streets of Chicago and New York -- HENNINGER: -- in gang crimes. RILEY: There is a Second Amendment there, right. GIGOT: And that was found in 2008, the Heller case -- GIGOT: -- which expressly involved handguns and guns in common use.

Democrats on Tuesday captured the House of Representatives and are set to exert a major institutional check on President Trump, while breaking the Republican monopoly on power and ushering in a younger, more female and more racially diverse political generation.      But the GOP solidified their Senate majority after an acerbic midterm election that enshrined America's deep divides and shaped a highly contentious battleground for the stirring 2020 presidential race.      Stick with CNN Politics as we sort through the changed political landscape. ||||| Republicans retained control of the Senate on Tuesday, ousting Democratic incumbents in Indiana and North Dakota and handing President Donald Trump a triumph by ensuring they will remain as guardians of his conservative agenda for two more years.      Despite Trump's deeply polarizing effect on voters, the GOP harnessed his rock-solid popularity with hard-right voters in rural, deep-red states. They held onto seats in the South, Midwest and West and ensured at least a 50-50 Senate — enough to give Republicans control because Vice President Mike Pence as president of the Senate would tip the balance to the GOP.      Republicans paved their path to victory by defeating Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. They also held on to competitive seats in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz fended off Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the well-financed liberal darling, and in Tennessee, where Rep. Marsha Blackburn prevailed.      The GOP Senate victory was magnified because Democrats stood a solid chance of wresting control of the House from Republicans.      That would give the Senate the role of blocking House-passed Democratic initiatives on everything from health care to the potential repeal of tax cuts on the wealthy that the GOP enacted last year.      It would also leave the Senate as the showcase for the GOP's goals of tax and spending cuts, trade, immigration restrictions, curbs on Obama's health care law and judicial nominations.      Republicans entered the night commanding the Senate only narrowly, 51-49. But a crucial piece of math was in their favor Tuesday: The Democrats and their two independent allies were defending 26 seats, Republicans just nine.      Blackburn, a conservative who is also an ardent Trump backer, defeated former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, 74. Bredesen had promised a bipartisan approach if elected and had won the endorsement of music star Taylor Swift.      Heitkamp lost to GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, whom Trump persuaded to seek the Senate seat. Heitkamp was hurt late in her campaign by an ad that mistakenly named some women as victims of sexual abuse.      The night's news wasn't completely disastrous for Democrats.      Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin was re-elected in West Virginia, a state Trump captured by 42 percentage points in his 2016 election triumph. Democratic incumbents also prevailed in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Midwestern states that Trump carried narrowly two years ago.      Overall, Democrats were defending seats in 10 states that Trump took in 2016, including five he won by at least a huge 19 percentage points. Trump prevailed in Indiana by 19 points.      Tuesday's midterm elections were among the most bitter in years.      Democrats' longshot prospects for capturing a Senate majority were pinned on expectations that their supporters, roused by revulsion toward Trump, would surge to the polls. Fueling their intensity have been Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and policies, his efforts to dismantle health care protections enacted under President Barack Obama and the #MeToo movement's fury over sexual harassment.      \\"Ever since President Trump has been in office, it has just been not the country that I am used to or that I thought I would be in,\\" said Sarah Roth, 22, a Democratic voter from Minnetonka, Minnesota. \\"And so this really was my opportunity to help this country in changing who is making the decisions.\\"      Democrats also had history on their side: 2002 was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.      Republicans were banking on those dynamics being offset by a vibrant economy and by a president whose insult-laden approach to political discourse was as stirring for conservative voters as it was infuriating to liberals.      Trump's racially tinged anti-immigrant rhetoric, while unpopular among college-educated urban and suburban voters, seemed helpful in deeply conservative areas.      \\"I believe he values immigration, but he wants to make sure we're safe,\\" said Tina Newby of Wetland, Michigan, a GOP voter. \\"I like the fact that he is not a politician, and I forgive some of the socially incorrect or politically incorrect things that he says.\\"      With so much at stake, Trump campaigned in over a dozen states with Senate elections since Labor Day, visiting some multiple times. He himself has characterized the election as a referendum on his presidency.      AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press, highlighted the effect Trump was having on voters. Nearly 4 in 10 said they were casting ballots to express opposition to him, while just 1 in 4 said their vote was an expression of support for the president.      In other results, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democrats Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar were easily re-elected. Along with Sherrod Brown, a pro-labor lawmaker re-elected in Ohio, the four are considered potential 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.      GOP hopes of gaining a seat from New Jersey were dashed when Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez won a third Senate term. Menendez won in the heavily Democratic state despite a federal bribery indictment that prosecutors dropped this year after a mistrial.      Also victorious was Republican Mitt Romney, the vanquished 2012 GOP presidential candidate who grabbed the Utah seat being vacated by the retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch. Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, his party's defeated 2016 vice presidential candidate, won re-election to the Senate.      Amid the recent rash of letter bombs and the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, Trump issued alarming and often unfounded warnings about caravans of migrants crossing Mexico toward the U.S., blaming Democrats, without evidence, for the threat he claimed they pose.      AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago      ___      AP reporters Jeff Baenen in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and John Flesher in Traverse City, Michigan, contributed. ||||| Conservative Rep.

Problem:Abstract: We evaluated certain histochemical tests for their ability to detect premalignant mucosa in the dimethylhydrazine model of colonic carcinogenesis. Biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure, rectum, and any visualized tumors were taken. The specimens were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to detect neutral mucins, high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins, fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin, and fluoresceinated Ulex europeus agglutinin. None of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa. However, Ulex europeus agglutinin, which bound to only 3% of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study, bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals, reaching a maximum of 90% positivity by 13-16 wk. Moreover, Ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93% of tumors. Mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum (but not the splenic flexure) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals, but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia.

If it's during the day, I would just make sure all of your curtains are drawns, shades and blinds pulled up and shutters open, to get as much natural light in the house as possible. Put some fresh flowers around, too. Otherwise, sounds like you're all set. – May 19, 2011 11:06 AM I have an end row house in NW w/vintage, contemporary and quasi traditional pieces. My one fireplace is in the dinning room with built in cabinets. Above the fireplace, the wall and the wall facing the fireplace is a goldenrod/mustard color. The side walls are off-white. The brick is the original to the 1908 house. What are your thoughts? Also, what are your thoughts on a fireplace in the dinning room and not in the living room. I'm envious of your dining room fireplace! How cozy to eat and entertain in the winter with a fire roaring in the background. My thoughts on what you describe: paint all the walls the same color, built-ins includedm especially if the room is small. – May 19, 2011 11:10 AM Good morning! I have a collection of antique children's ABC plates and some large feather edge platters. I would like to hang them on my dining room wall, but I am concerned that the spirng-loaded hangers might damage the plates. Any suggestions? Many many collectors have used the spring-loaded hangers over the years. I personally have several brown and white transferware platters in my kitchen hung with these gadgets. I would not worry about damaging them. Your collections sounds lovely by the way and what a great way to add your personal style to your room. – May 19, 2011 11:10 AM Not to open this up for discussion again, but I was recently in my cousin's home. She had fake flowers everywhere and I have to say they just did not look good and made the rooms look really fusty. How hard can it be to buy a five dollar bouquet of daisies at the grocery store each week? (If you have the money, of course). I just don't think that fake flowers add anything to a room except clutter. I agree with you. I think they are dust collectors. But plenty of people love them. – May 19, 2011 11:18 AM If you have easy to move furniture, try rearranging the furniture to leave an \\"aisle\\" to allow flow from the front to the back of the house. The problem with row houses is that they are narrow and once people are standing around, moving from the back of the house to the front or vice versa can be tricky especially if you have to navigate around furniture. The best situations I've seen is where you rearrange the furniture to provide easy flow. Also make sure there is adequate seating so that people have a way to socialize without standing in the walkways. – May 19, 2011 11:19 AM I recently visited some relatives and stayed in a wide range of guest rooms. Of course, I was happy to enjoy everyone's hospitality and so glad they opened their homes to me. But it did make me realize that I need to lie down on my own guest bed to see if the light on the nightstand shines in my eyes when I'm trying to read. And I have to say that I really dislike futons. (BTW, the best guest bedroom was the one with the view of the ocean--awoke each morning and lay in bed watching the waves crash on the shore.) Everyone should make a habit of spending an occasional night in their guest room to make sure it's comfortable and to make note of anything it lacks. Lighting is especially important. – May 19, 2011 11:22 AM And paint the fireplace brick a contrasting color that works with the rest of the decor. You want the fireplace to be a focal point, so make sure that it \\"pops\\" from the wall color. This is good advice. Here is another idea. I was at a party this week in house where the den was painted coral - the walls, fireplace, surround, bookshelves, everything. The family says this small room is their most cozy, favorite hangout. – May 19, 2011 11:22 AM I'm thinking, yet again, about paint my family room. The problem is that the space is open from the kitchen, a small dining area and the family room. I want to differentiate the areas without it looking like I've lost a battle with a box of crayolas. Yout don't have to rely on paint to differentiate between the spaces. You can use area rugs, furniture, window treatments, etc. – May 19, 2011 11:24 AM What advice would you give someone that is new (and clueless) with vintage furnishings and markets? It's best to just dive in. Keep in mind that you don't have to comprimise on quality just because it's vintage. For instance, I have a \\"butt\\" test for vintage seating. ALWAYS sit in it before you buy. Look for wobbles and sturdiness in tables. Know what your budget and stick to it. There will always be something in your price range, you may just have to be patient and look for a bit. – May 19, 2011 11:27 AM It's best to just dive in.

I need a place to store my shoes, and the entryway where I'd be putting them on seems like an ideal space. I'd like to put some sort of organizer under my console table, but I don't want the storage to detract from an otherwise neat and clutter free area. Do you know of any storage solutions that would hold about a dozen pairs of shoes in a hidden but accessible fashion under a regular height console table? I would use a storge ottoman tucked beneath the console table. Urban Outfitters has a nice one for only 240. YOu could also use two storage cubes, which you could also use for extra seating when you have guests, like these from Overstock.com. – May 19, 2011 11:28 AM Do you think it is appropriate to give a flea market or vintage item as a gift? I've always wondered this... I think giving a vintage item as a gift is a wonderful idea; I do it all the time. – May 19, 2011 11:30 AM That's not hard, but cleaning up the spilled mess when my toddler or cat knocks them over stinks. Try to keep them on bookshelves or on your mantel. – May 19, 2011 11:31 AM I have two matching, floor to ceiling (almost), bookshelves from Restoration Hardware in my dining room. The wood of the shelves and my table is rustic, and reclaimed, ashy colored. What do I put on the shelves? Books seem wrong for a dining room, but my crystal and fine china seems wrong too--too formal for such casual wood and open shelf display. Suggestions, please? (P.S. The shelf height is fixed around 20 inches apart.) Have you ever thought about using your china serving pieces as display instead of your crystal. Platters and bowls look a bit more rustic and substantial than crystal. Make sure to add a bit of texture with faux plants and natural pieces like shells, whatever your theme is. Go ahead and mix in some books to add height and interest. – May 19, 2011 11:32 AM Rather than think the choice is between fake flower and real flowers, how about having a living potted plant (one time cost) if buying fresh flowers every week is not in the budget? Much prettier than fake flowers and comparably priced. Yes! Great suggestion. Thank you. – May 19, 2011 11:33 AM I love flea markets, really I do! But shopping them can be overwhelming because amidst the treasure is, well, a lot of crap. How do you become a discerning shopper and bring home the items you don't regret, but cherish, later? It's best to make a list of the items/furniture you are looking for along with measurements before you leave the house. Make sure to look the piece over carefully before buying it. I have two rules, if you LOVE it, buy it! You will always find room for it. However, if you're not sure, walk AWAY! Don't talk yourself into a piece because it's a good deal. There will always be more stuff to buy! – May 19, 2011 11:35 AM Does anyone have experience with Pantone paints? (Am interested in a specific blue -- Pantone 287). I know there are retailers (Monarch, for one) but do not live near one. The paint is pricey and would love to know if anyone has used it. Terri and I have not used it, but it is a very well respected brand. Anyone out there want to chime in? – May 19, 2011 11:36 AM I saw on one of the HGTV shows, if you want variety for rooms that are visible to each other, select different shades from the same paint chip. You can make the room with the most windows the darkest shade and then use lighter shades for rooms with less natural light. And sometimes the colors look quite different when painted on walls, but they are still complementary. Yes. This is a good idea. Thanks for sharing it. – May 19, 2011 11:36 AM Just adding my 2 cents from what a previous poster said, I just brought a real houseplant for 2.98 at my super Walmart & if taken care of properly will last for yrs. Maybe she should buy her friend a real plant & see how long before she throws out those dust collectors for the real deal. – May 19, 2011 11:37 AM Our guest room has a queen size futon couch. To make it more comfortable, after we replaced our queen size bed, I keep the mattress in the basement and when I am expecting guests, I open the futon, put the mattress from the basement on the futon and then make the bed. Much more comfortable and doesn't cost anything, other than sweat labor to get the mattress back upstairs. If you don't want a full mattress, you can get thick mattress pads (Ikea has some that are like 2 inches thick) that roll up and are easier to maneuver. Very considerate of your overnight guests. – May 19, 2011 11:37 AM As part of our den redo, we plan to buy a flat-screen TV. We're having a hard time finding a cabinet to put it on, and to put the components into. I think the problem is size: We can only accommodate 42 inches of width and don't want a high, armoire type piece. Aside from the usual suspects (C&B, West Elm, R&B, Restoration Hardware), do you have any suggestions of possible sources? Many thanks.

Separated them out into three vases by keeping the same colors together (a la Martha Stewart's directions). They are just finally dying now. And I didn't have to dust them. Although I will say that I like fake flowers that aren't trying to be real, like the ones made of paper or wood. You make a good point. Buy a mixed bouquet for under 10 and fill a number of vases. I do not personally like paper or wood flowers. – May 19, 2011 11:39 AM We're remodeling our (extremely small) master bathroom in our 1917 home in DC - any suggestions for a design/style direction (e.g. finishes, tile, etc.) to make the space appear larger? Two words: classic and white. – May 19, 2011 11:40 AM I forwarded you a photo of the multi-colored brick of my 1940s house for you to suggest colors for shutters and trim. Currently all white. I also have a front porch with columns. Lots of multi-colored Victorians and Sears craft houses in the neighborhood, so I am tempted to go bold. Terri and I think you should either go with teal blue or a sage green to go with the Craftsman style of your neighborhood. Meanwhile, the best way to see what might look good with your brick is to drive around the neighborhood and look for houses like yours and see what colors they have used. It really helps to visualize the colors and see what strikes you as fun and good looking. – May 19, 2011 11:42 AM Are there any good online places (I'm in Boston) to buy ready made something other than the solid-or-just-faintly-striped-curtains-like-they-have-at-bed-bath-and-beyond at a pretty cheap pricepoint? My rented apartment needs something with pattern and color and summer-ness since I can't paint the white walls and it will apparently never stop raining here. West Elm has nice options. Try Anthropologie, too. – May 19, 2011 11:43 AM Can we please just agree to disagree? Taste is a subjective thing and while you may not like faux plants/flowers, I do for a myriad of reasons. I happen to dislike traditional furniture much more than faux plants, but I don't make it a point to try to dissuade someone who likes it from decorating with it. If you don't like them, don't decorate with them. How about everyone just do what makes them happy in their houses and not care what anyone else thinks. – May 19, 2011 11:45 AM If I have real flowers, my cats will nip at them and pull the vase over, creating a mess. They leave fake flowers alone. I rotate mine for each season and keep them clean. Not to mention, I have a lovely garden outside where I can enjoy fresh flowers. My cat has no interest in cut flowers. Thank goodness! – May 19, 2011 11:48 AM I think you can only give a gift from a thrift store or flea market if you've really put thought into it. If I see extra pieces of a friend's china or glassware or see a horribly wonderful Xmas sweater for a snarky friend, I snatch them up, but I wouldn't give a random, used cookbook as a hostess gift (unless maybe it was out of print, and I knew the hostess was searching for it!). You give really wise advice here. Love the idea of finding a friend's china or glassware pattern. – May 19, 2011 11:49 AM Just wanted to share a few vintage shopping points! Remember to always look a piece over thoroughly BEFORE you buy it. Sit it in, wiggle it, wobble it! Don't buy it if it's not sound! You will always find more treasures at the nest venue! – May 19, 2011 11:50 AM There are all sorts of creative solutions for hiding shoe storage, like this one that hides inside a small sitting bench and could be easily tucked under a console. You can google for \\"shoe storage\\" and find loads of options. First thing to do: declutter your shoes. – May 19, 2011 11:51 AM For the person in Boston, Country Curtains has a web site and some Massachusetts stores. I believe an Annapolis one also. They are not expensive, mostly fairly traditional looking and made in Massachusetts. Think it is countrycurtains.com. A curtain suggestion for the Boston chatter... – May 19, 2011 11:54 AM Try Country Curtains (www.countrycurtains.com). They have very nice products with a variety of patterns and fabrics. Free swatches. I'm currently drooling over the sheers with dragonflies on them. And I apologize for reopening the fake flowers vs real flowers debate again. Mea culpa. – May 19, 2011 11:54 AM Why is outdoor furniture so expensive? I want to buy a dining set and a small seating set, but it will cost thousands of dollars, it seems. Has anyone found a reasonable place to buy outdoor furniture that has quality options? My last set from Target was beautiful, but faded and rusted. Any unique sources that I would have not yet considered? I feel like I've looked everywhere and to get all of the furniture I want for 1800 or less is impossible. Thanks for any insights that you have to offer! Retail furniture can be expensive! Trying vintage! Look for sound wicker and metal furniture. Make sure to give it a good scrub! Don't skip this step! Use Rust-o-leum (love it) indoor/outdoor spray paint. At least 2 coats! Great seating at a great price! – May 19, 2011 11:54 AM Then there'd be no need for a Home column in the paper, lol!

Thanks to Robin for joining us (and for soldiering on despite of technical difficulties). Enjoy your weekend and chat with you next Thursday. Good morning! I'm interested in replacing my patterned dishware with just plain white dishes that I can then dress up with patterned serving pieces and such.

Question: I can use this background: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.  Now, I have a new situation: Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought.  Answer this question please: Which region had more plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to decrease water use? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant background information needed to answer the question.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Shell is today setting out plans to break up its Brent field platforms, after nearly 40 years of being battered by the elements. As BBC Scotland's Kevin Keane explains, it takes a lot of planning to remove the topside, and a whole lot more for the jacket and seabed storage tanks. To do the job, the double-hulled, Swiss-owned Pieter Shelte has recently arrived in the North Sea from South Korea, capable of lifting 48,000 tonnes of topside, and a 25,000 tonne jacket. (Its name, crewing and Panamanian flag are rather less awe-inspiring to the RMT trade union, which points out it is named after a Nazi war criminal). Now, multiply that Brent Delta by 475 other offshore installations, 5,000 wells, 10,000km of pipelines and 15 onshore installations.  And more are now being installed east and west of Shetland, which will need removed after a few more decades. I was writing about this big economic opportunity in the world's biggest scrapyard more than four years ago, and about the giant ships being built to lift equipment. When I wrote that, the estimated cost of decommissioning had just risen from £19bn to £27bn. It has most recently been put at £37bn, spread out until 2040. But it has been slow to get started, while the oil price has remained high. Oil & Gas UK, representing the industry, published its projections before the rapid slide in the price of Brent crude, and it reckoned that the £900m spend on decommissioning last year will rise to an annual average of £1.3bn for the rest of this decade, peaking at £1.7bn next year. That schedule may change a lot if fields are becoming less economic. The boss of BP has today said that he's heard, anecdotally, a third of North Sea fields are now running at a loss. BP has confirmed plans to cut back harshly on its capital expenditure plans for this year, down by between £2.6bn and £4bn to less than £14bn. The value of its global reserves has been slashed by £2bn, and those of fellow UK energy company BG Group by £4bn. For these big oil companies, the North Sea is among the more mature and least profitable of basins. In trying to cut costs, at least two companies plan a rota change from working two weeks on and two weeks off, to a three-week turnaround. And where fields are getting old, much more decommissioning could be brought forward. Who gets the work? Teesside seems to be in the lead. Shell intends to send its equipment for breaking up and recycling on a quay at Hartlepool yard. Norwegian yards are also poised to grab a share. The facilities, supply chain and expertise can be found in Scotland, but they appear to be lagging somewhat. The argument that the decommissioning boom will be brought forward depends on that oil price remaining low. Yet it's bouncing back. Having fallen close to 45 last month, it's now trading above 56. \\"People are very, very skittish,\\" according to one trader. If there's one explanation for the rise, it is the self-correcting nature of the oil glut. Oil exporters, led by Saudi Arabia, have kept pumping rather than cutting supply to support price. The price fell. Data published last Friday showed the industry quickly cut back on the number of shale rigs at work in North America. That should feed through to falling supply in about nine months, as pressure runs down in the shale seams. For BP and others, there's less money being put into exploration, and that will feed through to less supply in a few years. It's expected that some expensive fields will be plugged earlier than planned. So taken together, there are lots of reasons why supply will fall. And so the price can be expected to rise again. However, don't expect it to be without bumps along the road. The harsh winter in America is boosting demand for heating oil. There are huge inventories being built up, with marine tankers now being used to store oil in anticipation of a higher price, and that in itself depresses the price. If the price lifts to about 70 per barrel, you can expect those fracking rigs to become viable once more, and they can quickly be put back to work. While the price will surely remain volatile, that seems a more comfortable equilibrium price on which exporting companies can get along with their American competitors. It's unfortunate for the North Sea, meanwhile that the long-term break even point for a significant number of oil fields is above 70. And after this week's Aberdeen summit of oil industry leaders and Scotland's two governments, it's worth remembering that all the talk of tax cuts in next months' Budget may be not only too late, but of little consequence. If oil fields are not profitable, then there is no profit on which to levy tax. Summary:","output":"Royal Dutch Shell is outlining plans to dismantle its Brent field platforms, after enduring nearly 40 years of harsh conditions in the North Sea. Decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure is a complex project requiring significant planning and costs. The Brent field decommissioning process involves the use of the Swiss-owned Pieter Shelte, a double-hulled vessel capable of lifting 48,000 tonnes of topside and a 25,000 tonne jacket. This is only one of the 475 offshore installations, 5,000 wells, 10,000 km of pipelines, and 15 onshore facilities that will require dismantling in the coming years. Decommissioning is estimated to cost around £37 billion, stretched out until 2040. Decommissioning will become more common as oil fields become less profitable. Teesside and Norwegian yards are expected to lead the race in receiving decommissioning work, while Scottish facilities lag behind. The future of decommissioning projects largely depends on oil price fluctuations and the resulting profitability of oil fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"TT Jackson\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who are the parents of Tito, Taj, and Taryll?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"TT Jackson\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Who are the parents of Tito, Taj, and Taryll?\\". The correct answer is Tito Jackson and Delores Martes Jackson. Tito, Taj, and Taryll are the children of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson, and they form the R&B group 3T."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. – The (potentially) former prime minister of Lebanon's mysterious two-week stay in Saudi Arabia has come to an end, as Saad Hariri arrived in France on Saturday morning and met with French President Emmanuel Macron, the New York Times reports. Hariri was in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4 when he suddenly and shockingly resigned as prime minister. Since then, Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept his resignation among widespread speculation Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will, according to the AP. Early Saturday, Hariri tweeted that it was a \\"lie\\" that Saudi Arabia was detaining him. However, speculation of Saudi leverage continues as Hariri was joined by his wife and eldest son in France while his younger children—attending school in Saudi Arabia—were notably absent. Aoun says Hariri will return to Lebanon in time for its Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, and it's unclear if Hariri will go ahead with his resignation or take it back upon his return. Hariri told reporters in France that he will \\"declare my political stance\\" after meeting with Aoun. He has not publicly discussed what happened during his time in Saudi Arabia. Hariri's resignation and lengthy absence started a political crisis in Lebanon that goes beyond the organization of the government. There is speculation that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign as part of a power struggle with Iran, which Hariri denounced during his resignation, the BBC reports. There is fear of a looming war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which only increased Saturday when Saudi Arabia asked its citizens to leave Lebanon for the second time in two weeks. Expand this summary.","output":"The sudden and shocking resignation of Saad Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, has sparked significant political upheaval and speculation regarding his mysterious two-week stay in Saudi Arabia. On November 4th, Hariri announced his resignation while in the kingdom, fueling widespread speculation that he was being held there against his will. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept Hariri's resignation, and there are concerns regarding potential Saudi influence over Hariri's actions. Recently, Hariri arrived in France, joined by his wife and eldest son, and met with French President Emmanuel Macron. In his first public statement since his resignation, Hariri dismissed the notion that he was detained in Saudi Arabia. However, some still question whether Saudi Arabia is exerting control over him, as his younger children studying in the kingdom remained behind. Hariri has not yet addressed the reasons behind his stint in Saudi Arabia or the nature of his relationship with the Saudis. President Aoun has indicated that Hariri will return to Lebanon for Independence Day on November 22nd. It remains unclear whether Hariri will uphold his resignation or rescind it upon his return. He has vowed to \\"declare my political stance\\" upon meeting with Aoun. The political crisis in Lebanon reaches beyond the organization of its government, as Saudi Arabia's potential role raises broader questions about the regional power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Some believe Hariri's resignation was a move orchestrated by the Saudis to challenge Iran, which Hariri criticized during his resignation speech. The prospect of an escalating conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia has only intensified with recent events, such as Saudi Arabia urging its citizens to leave Lebanon for the second time in two weeks. As tensions continue to mount, the situation involving Lebanon's former Prime Minister Hariri, Saudi Arabia, and the broader geopolitical landscape raises concerns about the stability of the region and the potential for conflict between rival powers Iran and Saudi Arabia. This development underscores the need for careful attention and diplomacy to prevent further escalation and promote a stable political environment in Lebanon and the surrounding nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article using the following points: Scientists claim ancient riverbeds on Mars were created by warm spells. These arose from volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and orbit changes. But they would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop. Study was carried out on craters at 3.6billion-year-old Aeolis Dorsa region. Comes just weeks after mysterious light was caught on camera on Mars.","output":"Title: Ancient Riverbeds on Mars: A Study of their Origins and Implications for Life Introduction The quest for understanding the history and potential habitability of Mars has captivated scientists and laypeople alike. The red planet has often been the subject of speculation about whether it could have once harbored life, a question that remains gripping as space agencies across the world continue to explore and investigate the mysteries of Mars. Recently, researchers have made a significant discovery that sheds new light on the planet's geological history. Ancient Riverbeds and Warm Spells on Mars In a groundbreaking study, scientists have determined that ancient riverbeds located in the Aeolis Dorsa region on Mars were likely created by periodic warm spells, which were in turn, caused by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the planet's orbit. These findings reinforce the idea that Mars has undergone dramatic environmental changes over its 4.6 billion-year history. The research, carried out by examining 3.6 billion-year-old craters in the Aeolis Dorsa region, has provided valuable insights into the climatic conditions of ancient Mars. The presence of these riverbeds indicates that significant water flow was present during the planet's early history, enabling these ancient rivers to carve their way through the martian landscape. The Role of Volcanic Eruptions, Asteroid Impacts, and Orbit Changes Scientists believe that the warm spells responsible for the flow of water on Mars were triggered by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the planetary orbit. The immense heat generated by volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts would have melted subsurface ice, releasing vast quantities of water that flowed across the martian surface. Additionally, as Mars' orbit gradually shifted over time, periodic climatic fluctuations may have also caused changes in temperature, promoting the periodic formation of riverbeds. Limited Timeframe for Life While the discovery of ancient riverbeds suggests a wetter and more Earth-like past for Mars, researchers emphasize that these warm spells were relatively short-lived. The temporary nature of these warm periods would not have provided the necessary stable temperatures and water supply for the development of complex organisms. Consequently, despite the identification of ancient riverbeds, the likelihood that life once thrived on Mars remains speculative at best. Intriguingly, this study comes hot on the heels of another captivating mystery on Mars. Just weeks ago, a peculiar light was caught on camera by the Mars Curiosity rover, sparking widespread curiosity and generating further intrigue surrounding the red planet. Conclusion The discovery of ancient riverbeds on Mars provides a fascinating glimpse into the planet's past, when volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and orbit changes created conditions favorable for water flow. While these warm spells were insufficient in duration to support life, the findings of this research continue to unlock new mysteries about Mars and its ancient geological history, fostering even greater interest in the ongoing exploration of our enigmatic planetary neighbor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What will be the result of people not hiding their emotions probably?

Abby, who had never met Nicole before, was shocked by the intensity of the situation. \\"She certainly knows how to make an entrance,\\" she commented, her voice tinged with both awe and sympathy. From the way Dominic talked about Nicole, she had expected a confident, albeit obnoxious sister. But the confrontation had revealed a much deeper and darker side to their family dynamic. Dominic continued to chuckle, attempting to brush off the events that had just transpired. \\"Well, that's Nicole for you. Always the emotional one. Never mind her, let's just get back to planning our next move.\\" It was clear, however, that the situation was far from over. Thomas, who was still processing the implications of the argument, turned to Dominic. \\"You can't ignore this, Dominic. I know you two never see eye-to-eye, but threatening legal action? That's a whole new level.\\" Dominic sighed, frustration seeping out of him as he slowly realized the gravity of the issue. \\"I know, I know. But honestly, what was I supposed to do? She was getting out of control with her demands.\\" His voice had lost its mirth, replaced by a defensive tone that indicated he was feeling cornered. In that moment, Abby decided to step in as the mediator. \\"Look, Dominic, I may not know the full history between you two, but it's obvious that there's a lot of hurt and anger on both sides. I just think it might be better if you two sit down together and talk things through calmly, without threats or accusations.\\" Thomas nodded in agreement, adding, \\"Abby's right. This isn't just about the current dispute. It's about years of sibling rivalry and unresolved issues. It's about time you two faced it and tried to work it out.\\" Dominic hesitated for a few seconds before reluctantly agreeing. \\"Fine. I'll call her and see if we can meet up to discuss things rationally.\\" The following day, Dominic and Nicole met at a local coffee shop, a neutral territory where they could talk without distractions. Their conversation was tense at first, but as they opened up about their feelings and past experiences, progress was slowly made. They acknowledged the mistakes they had both made, which resulted in apologies and the eventual realization that they needed one another more than they had ever thought possible. In the end, it was Abby and Thomas's intervention that helped them see the importance of family and restoring their relationship. They both knew the road to healing wouldn't be easy, but they chose to put their differences aside and work towards creating a better future together. As for the business dispute that had ignited their recent argument, they eventually agreed to a compromise, allowing both parties to come out of the ordeal with a fair resolution. With the weight of past anger and resentment slowly lifting, Dominic and Nicole found themselves able to enjoy each other's company and slowly rebuilt their bond as siblings. Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to help us recognize the value of our relationships and make the effort to reconnect with those we've hurt or lost along the way. It may not be easy, and it may take time, but healing old wounds and restoring relationships can ultimately be worth the effort – for family always holds a special place in our hearts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate.

Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks.  - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions.  - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake.  - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war .  - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations.  - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767  5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America.

Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel  - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes.  - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron.  - George Downie (19 January 1778  11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada, Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya.   - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.   - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance.

The Utah governor is considering whether to sign a bill that would make Utah the first state to require... (Associated Press)      SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The governor has signed a bill that makes Utah the first state to require doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later.      The bill signed by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert Monday is based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point.      \\"The governor is adamantly pro-life. He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child,\\" Herbert spokesman Jon Cox said.      Many doctors in Utah and across the country are concerned that the requirement could increase the health risks to women by giving them unnecessary heavy sedation in order to protect a fetus from pain that it may or may not feel.      Dr. Sean Esplin of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah said anesthesia or an analgesic would need to go through the woman in order to reach the fetus. Doctors could give a woman general anesthesia, which would make her unconscious and likely require a breathing tube, or a heavy dose of narcotics.      No other U.S. state has passed this same law, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the abortion-rights nonprofit Guttmacher Institute. Montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries, including abortions, performed after 20 or more weeks of gestation, but its Democratic governor vetoed the measure.      Twelve states ban abortions after around 20 weeks of gestation, while a handful of other states give women the option of having anesthesia.      Previous Utah law gave women the choice to have anesthesia during an abortion.      The new law by Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, targets a small subset of women who have elective abortions beginning at 20 weeks. State law normally allows abortions until viability, which is at about 22 weeks.      But it could affect women in many other medical situations.      Utah law defines abortions in part as \\"the intentional termination or attempted termination of human pregnancy after implantation of a fertilized ovum through a medical procedure carried out by a physician or through a substance used under the direction of a physician.\\"      David Turok of the University of Utah's obstetrics and gynecology department said that could apply to instances in which a woman is past her due date so the doctor induces labor or there's a problem with the pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia, so it's safer to deliver the baby early. These common procedures could now require general anesthesia, he said.      \\"You never give those medicines if you don't have to,\\" Turok said.      Laura Bunker of the conservative group United Families International said if there is any chance a fetus feels pain at 20 weeks, doctors should do everything possible to make sure they are comfortable.      The new law would not apply to women who must have an abortion because their life is at risk or the fetus will not survive outside the womb.      Utah Medical Association CEO Michelle McOmber said her organization feels neutral toward the legislation. The association convinced Bramble to change its language from saying a fetus \\"is capable of experiencing pain,\\" to it \\"may be capable of experiencing pain.\\" She said the association would have preferred that the proposal stated it is inconclusive whether or not the fetus feels pain.      Bramble initially sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks entirely, but he changed course after the Legislature's attorneys warned him that any such measure would likely be unconstitutional. ||||| Weeks after last menstruation      Usually when fetus is deemed viable      When fetus is considered full term      Fertilization      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9      10      11      12      13      14      15      16      17      18      19      20      21      22      23      24      25      26      27      28      ...      36      37      38      39      40      Mississippi’s law is based on the fetal pain assertion.

This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion.      Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks’ gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.      Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks’ gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.      Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures. ||||| Gov. Gary Herbert (R-Utah) signed a bill that makes Utah the first state to mandate anesthesia use in abortions at 20 weeks or later. Supporters say it prevents the fetus from pain, but some decry the evidence as unfounded and say it could complicate procedures. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)      A woman in Utah is allowed to have an abortion at 20 weeks. But does she have to give her fetus painkillers in the process?      Yes, the state said Monday, when it became the only state in the nation to require doctors to give anesthesia to women undergoing abortions at 20 weeks or later.      Advocates of the law say that the regulation prevents fetuses from suffering during abortions. But doctors in Utah and elsewhere say there’s no proof that fetuses are able to feel anything at that point in pregnancy, and that sedating women during the procedure puts them at risk of complications.      “You’re now mandating [women] take that risk, based on inconclusive and biased evidence. You don’t understand what you’re legislating,” Dr. Sean Esplin, a doctor with Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, testified at committee hearing on the bill earlier this month.      The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Curt Bramble (R-Provo), said he initially hoped to ban abortions after 20 weeks, but he was told that such a law would probably challenged on constitutional grounds. This measure was next best option, he told the Salt Lake Tribune; it requires doctors to take steps to “eliminate or alleviate organic pain to the unborn child” except for in cases when the abortion is necessary to prevent the health of the mother, when the fetus suffers from a deadly congenital defect, or when the administration of anesthetic might put the mother at risk.      “In this quote ‘medical procedure,’ let’s call it what it is. It’s killing babies. And if we’re going to kill that baby, we ought to protect it from pain,” Bramble said.      This is a new twist on an old argument: For years, antiabortion advocates have used the fetal pain argument to justify bans on abortion 20 weeks after conception. According to the National Right to Life Committee, “pain-capable unborn protection” laws are currently on the books in 12 states (though they’re being challenged in two).      But the idea that 20-week-old fetuses can feel anything is disputed; a 2005 review of more than 300 studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester (28 weeks).      Utah generally does not allow abortions after the point of viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.      Esplin told the Associated Press that the new law means that any anesthetic or analgesic will have to be administered to the mother; women having abortions will either be placed under general anesthesia — meaning they’re unconscious and hooked up to a breathing tube — or sedated with a heavy dose of narcotics. Previously, women were given a choice to be anesthetized.      General anesthesia carries its own side effects and risks, and doctors say they try to avoid it except in cases where it’s absolutely necessary.      “You never give those medicines if you don’t have to,” David Turok of the University of Utah’s obstetrics and gynecology department told the AP.      Turok and some lawmakers have expressed concern that the rule could be interpreted as mandating that pregnant women be anesthetized for all procedures that happen after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Utah law defines abortions as “the intentional termination or attempted termination of human pregnancy” through a medical procedure carried out by or ordered by a physician — loosely interpreted, that could include instances of induced labor, such as when a woman is past her due date.      State Sen. Brian Shiozawa (R-Cottonwood Heights), who is also an emergency room doctor, told the Deseret News earlier this month that if the law was passed, “you can forget natural birth and labor” because there’s probably pain to a fetus coming down the birth canal as well.      In an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, Shiozawa said he is “all for” changing the statutes on abortion. But this bill, he added, was “cumbersome” for women and their doctors.      The new law makes Utah the only state in the country where women must undergo anesthesia to have an abortion. The Montana legislature passed a similar law last year, but it was vetoed by the state’s democratic governor Steve Bullock.      Utah’s governor, Gary Herbert (R), who signed the bill into law Monday, said last month that rather than get into a debate about abortion, he just wanted to address the question: “If we’re going to have abortion, what is the most humane way to do it?”      “Fetuses have a heartbeat after about five weeks. And the idea of just being callous about that should cause all of humanity concern” regardless of their stance on abortion, he continued.      Though the new law is controversial, its impact will likely be limited, Karrie Galloway, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Utah, told the Salt Lake Tribune. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, only 17 Utah women had abortions after 20 weeks. Planned Parenthood is the only provider in the state that provides abortions during the window covered by the law.      But Galloway said the idea that lawmakers with no medical knowledge are dictating what women and their doctors can do “is what’s infuriating.”      “I mean, we have fetal medical specialists speaking and they were discounted by a citizen who said, ‘I read it on the Internet and therefore it must be true,'” she said. “That’s how we do policy here in Utah.” ||||| Thie March 10, 2016 file photo Utah Gov.

Gary Herbert signed a bill that requires doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion 20 weeks into their pregnancy or later — the first law of its kind in the USA.      Among other provisions, SB 0234 requires doctors who perform abortions to administer an anesthetic on women who are at least 20 weeks pregnant, suggesting it would reduce or eliminate pain a fetus may be feeling.      \\"The governor is adamantly pro-life,\\" said Jon Cox, spokesman for the Republican governor, in an emailed statement. \\"He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child.\\"      At the center of the debate in the Legislature was the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point.

Curt Bramble, R- Provo, speaks during a news conference at the Utah State Capitol, in Salt Lake City. Utah's Senate on Friday, March 4, 2016, will debate a proposal that would require doctors to administer anesthesia before an abortion performed after 20 weeks gestation, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. State law currently gives women the choice to have anesthesia for the fetus to reduce potential pain during abortion. Anesthesia would be mandatory under the legislation sponsored by Republican Sen. Curt Bramble. (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP)      Unlike several states, Utah does not ban abortions, but it has several provisions that pro-choice advocates say complicate the process for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies. A woman looking to get an abortion must get counseling in person before making the final decision and then wait 72 hours before getting the procedure done. Public funding is available for abortion in cases of rape, incest or when necessary to save the woman or prevent long-lasting damage to her physical health, according to the abortion-rights nonprofit the Guttmacher Institute.      The state Senate amended the bill before passing it earlier this month to make sure the anesthesia was not mandated in cases where it could hurt the mother.      Many doctors in Utah and throughout the country are concerned that the plan could pose a risk to women because fetal anesthesia is unnecessary.      “You’re telling women that they have to have something that’s going to increase their risk based on a conclusion that is not true,” Dr. Sean Esplin of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah told the Associated Press.      But supporters of the law say a fetus should be protected if there’s even a chance it can feel pain. Bramble believes the evidence suggesting a fetus can feel pain by 20 weeks outweighs opponents' arguments.      The law makes sense in Utah, he said, where convicts sentenced to death and animals facing euthanasia receive anesthetics.      \\"We go to extraordinary lengths in Utah to prevent the pain of an individual sentenced to death,\\" he said. \\"With euthanasia, we make every effort to not inflict pain on that animal....(mandating anesthesia) it is consistent with other policies we have in the state of Utah.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MxfXsS ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Utah Governor Gary Herbert has signed a bill making Utah the first US state to require doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later, as it is based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point; the law is aimed at \\"minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child\\".

A: Answer:","output":"The part of a plant that protects the plant cell, maintains its shape, and prevents excessive uptake of water is called the cell wall. The cell wall is a rigid, semi-permeable, and non-living structure that surrounds the plant cell, providing mechanical support and maintaining cellular integrity. It is composed of complex carbohydrates, mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, as well as a small amount of proteins. These components are organized in a network-like structure, giving the cell wall its strength and flexibility. The primary functions of the cell wall in plant cells include: 1. Protection: The cell wall serves as a physical barrier against external factors such as mechanical stress, pathogens, and herbivores. It safeguards the delicate and sensitive cytoplasmic components, helping plants resist damage and infections. 2. Structural support: One of the main roles of the cell wall is to provide mechanical support and maintain the shape of plant cells. The rigidity of the cell wall, particularly in combination with the pressure exerted by the central vacuole, allows plant cells to maintain their shape, resist compression, and grow upright, even under the weight of the plant itself. 3. Regulation of water uptake: The cell wall plays a vital role in controlling the amount of water that enters the cell through a process known as osmosis. The semi-permeable nature of the cell wall ensures that only a certain amount of water can be absorbed by the plant cell, thus preventing excessive uptake of water that could cause the cell to burst. This regulation of water uptake also helps to maintain the turgor pressure inside the cell, which is crucial for its proper functioning and growth. 4. Cell expansion and growth: As plant cells grow, their cell walls must expand accordingly to accommodate the increasing size and volume. The cell wall is dynamic and can be modified through the actions of various enzymes that break and re-form the bonds between the wall components, allowing the cell wall to stretch as the cell grows. This ability to expand is essential for plant cell growth, elongation, and differentiation. 5. Cell-to-cell communication and adhesion: The cell wall also plays a role in cell-to-cell communication and adhesion, enabling the exchange of nutrients and signaling molecules between adjacent plant cells. Channels called plasmodesmata span across the cell walls and connect the cytoplasm of neighboring cells, facilitating this cell-to-cell communication. In summary, the plant cell wall is a dynamic and essential structure that supports, protects, and regulates plant cells, assisting with various functions such as maintaining cellular integrity, controlling water uptake, facilitating growth, and enabling cell-to-cell communication. Its unique composition and organization allow it to perform these critical roles and contribute to the overall growth and development of plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the name of that which had become the most commonly used drilling fluid by 2009? is inside the article: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

It is part of a consolidated city-county government known as the \\"Unified Government\\". Wyandotte County also includes the independent cities of Bonner Springs and Edwardsville. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 145,786 residents. It is situated at Kaw Point, which is the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers.  - State Line Road is a major northsouth street in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area that runs along the KansasMissouri state line. It runs 12.5 miles (20 km) from Chester Avenue in the north, crossing U.S. Highway 56 a couple of miles from the northern end and continuing south to the intersection of 135th St. in Kansas, Missouri route 150 in the South. It continues north as Eaton St. and continues south as Kenneth Rd., both in Kansas. It's northernmost point is roughly 3/4 mile (1.25 km) south of Interstate 35. It is the dividing line between Kansas and Missouri for most of the Kansas City metro area south of the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers. Cities along the road include Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas, and several smaller communities in Kansas such as Leawood, Mission Hills, Prairie Village, and Westwood Hills.  - Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri and the sixth largest city in the Midwest. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had an estimated population of 475,378 in 2015, making it the 36th largest city by population in the United States. It is the anchor city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the KansasMissouri border. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a Missouri River port at its confluence with the Kansas River coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850 the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory. Confusion between the two ensued and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon thereafter.  - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.  - Interstate 35 (IH-35 or I-35) is a major northsouth Interstate Highway in the central United States. I-35 stretches from Laredo, Texas, on the AmericanMexican border to Duluth, Minnesota, at Minnesota Highway 61 (London Road) and 26th Avenue East. Many Interstate Highways formerly had splits or spurs indicated with suffixed letters (N/S/E/W), and I-35 was the only one that still had such divisions, before the recent opening of I-69C, I-69E, and I-69W in South Texas.

With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - Southwest Trafficway is a major north/south road that runs in Kansas City, Missouri from 27th Street & I-35 to 43rd Street at Madison Avenue and Belleview Avenue.  - The Kansas City metropolitan area is a 15-county metropolitan area anchored by Kansas City, Missouri, that straddles the border between the U.S. states of Missouri and Kansas.

There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy.

Lesbian pulp fiction was published in the 1950s and 60s by many of the same paperback publishing houses that other genres of fiction including westerns, romances, and detective fiction. Because very little other literature was available for and about lesbians at this time, quite often these books were the only reference the public (lesbian and otherwise) had for modeling what lesbians were. Stephanie Foote, from the University of Illinois commented on the importance of lesbian pulp novels to the lesbian identity prior to feminism: \\"Pulps have been understood as signs of a secret history of readers, and they have been valued because they have been read.

The character first appeared in 1930. The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs and to eliminate racist stereotypes, with arguable success. In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less assertive and more feminine.

Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.

By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his  novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens  said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion.

Here is a news article: Apple Beijing Shop Pelted With Eggs as IPhone Debut Botched      By Bloomberg News      (Adds background on Hong Kong crowds in 11th paragraph.)      Jan. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., whose skill at hyping new products helped make it the world’s most valuable technology company, became a victim of its own success after a botched introduction of its iPhone 4S in China led it to suspend sales.      Would-be customers who waited overnight as temperatures dropped below minus 9 degrees Celsius reacted with fury after the company’s main store in Beijing’s Sanlitun district failed to open. The company sold out of the handsets at stores that did open and later halted sales of all iPhones at its five retail outlets in the country “for the time being,” spokeswoman Carolyn Wu said by phone.      Apple had advertised that the store would open at 7 a.m. At 7:15 a.m., people began chanting “Open the door!” and “Liars!” after an unidentified man said over a bullhorn that the phone wouldn’t go on sale today, without giving an explanation. The store stayed closed “for safety reasons,” Wu said. Beijing police temporarily cordoned off the shop after it was pelted with eggs by the crowd.      “This is a debacle,” Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, a Shanghai-based retail advising company, said in a phone interview today. “Everybody knows there will be massive numbers of people when Apple has this kind of a launch. This shows very poor retail management ability.”      ‘Very Angry’      Elsewhere in the capital, the introduction went more smoothly. At Apple’s store in the Xidan neighborhood, the company handed out 1,000 tickets good for the purchase of a maximum two iPhone 4S handsets each. In Shanghai, a store in the Pudong district opened an hour early to accommodate the waiting crowds before selling out of the phones immediately.      “I’m very angry,” said Li Yun, 59, a retiree who said she tried to buy the device on behalf of her daughter at the People’s Square store in Shanghai. “They had said they would start selling the iPhone 4S at 7 a.m. but I was told they were already sold out by the time I got here at 6 a.m.”      About 60 migrant workers, hired by resellers to line up last night outside Apple’s store in Beijing’s Xidan, weren’t paid the 120 yuan (19) they were promised because they failed to get an iPhone 4S after the 12-hour wait, according to several of them, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. They came by bus from a labor market in the suburbs and received only a 10-yuan food allowance, they said.      Expansion Slowed      The crush of crowds at the stores is a reflection of the company’s decision to slow the opening of outlets in China, Rein said.      Apple in February 2010 announced a plan for 25 stores in China over two years, then slowed the expansion. Including the Hong Kong shop, which started selling the iPhone 4s on Nov. 11, there are six in the country.      “There isn’t enough product in enough retail points,” Rein said. “If they had more points of sale, it would disperse the crowds.”      Hundreds of people lined up outside the store in Hong Kong’s IFC Mall for several nights when the new iPhone went on sale, prompting police to use metal barricades to keep order.      Apple has more than 300 outlets worldwide and planned to sell the latest iPhone model through its three stores in Shanghai, two in Beijing, the two main cities in the world’s largest mobile-phone market.      Second-Largest Market      The Cupertino, California-based company sold 5.6 million iPhones in China in the first nine months of last year, giving it a 10.4 percent share of the smartphone market in the third quarter, according to research company Gartner Inc. Apple’s Wu earlier declined to comment on the outlook for iPhone 4S sales in China.      Apple’s stores in China generate the highest traffic and highest revenue of any of the company’s stores in the world, on average, Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said last January.      The maker of Macintosh computers and the iPad tablet increased its revenue in China to 13 billion in the year ended Sept. 24, from 3 billion a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in October. China accounted for 16 percent of Apple’s revenue in the fiscal fourth-quarter, making it the company’s biggest national market after the U.S.      Foxconn Suicides      Today’s confrontation wasn’t the first during a product introduction at the Sanlitun store, which opened in 2008 as Apple’s first in the country. In May, the store was temporarily closed when a group that lined up outside to buy the iPad 2 “became unruly,” Wu of Apple said at the time. Four people were injured and a glass door to the shop was smashed, the China Daily reported.      The violence adds to challenges for Apple in China, where company supplier Foxconn Technology Group was hit by a series of employee suicides. The Taipei-based company installed safety nets on buildings, raised pay and hired counselors in 2010 after at least 10 workers killed themselves. Apple also commissioned a review by a team of suicide-prevention experts.      China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest carrier, is the only one of the country’s three service providers offering the iPhone with a service contract. The company sent a text message to subscribers trumpeting free home delivery of the new handset through its online store.      Yellow Bulls      “Buy the iPhone 4S without lining up!” China Unicom said in a text sent to subscribers in Beijing. Unicom’s online shop made the device available at midnight, the text said.      While Apple suspended iPhone 4s sales at its China shops, the handsets remain available on its website as well as from Unicom and resellers, Wu said.      Sophia Tso, a spokeswoman at China Unicom in Hong Kong, didn’t immediately reply to messages left by phone and e-mail seeking comment.      The Unicom site lists the 16-gigabyte model for 5,880 yuan (932), with different levels of subsidies. The handset is free to users committing to a three-year plan for 286 yuan a month or a two-year plan costing 386 yuan a month, the website said.      The crowd around Apple’s main Beijing store diminished after police lifted the cordon and the doors remained closed. Some waited a while longer for a chance to buy the phone, which includes voice recognition software that doesn’t work with Mandarin, before giving up.      “We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees,” Wu said.      The fracas outside the store was caused by yellow bulls, a euphemism for people who buy the phones for sale at a markup, Tony Si, an 18-year-old bartender, said outside the store. The disorder, police response and store closing was their fault, not Apple’s, though he is still disappointed, he said.      “I’m angry because they said they’d sell it, and now they aren’t selling it,” Si said.      --Edmond Lococo, with assistance from Margaret Conley and Stephanie Wong in Shanghai, Shiyin Chen in Singapore, Feifei Shen and Bloomberg News in Beijing and Mark Lee in Hong Kong.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) (Associated Press)      Apple reacted to the scuffle by postponing iPhone 4S sales in its mainland China stores to protect the safety of customers and employees. It said the phone still will be sold online and through its local carrier.      Customers including migrant workers hired by scalpers in teams of 20 to 30 to buy iPhones for resale at a markup to Chinese gadget fans waited overnight in freezing weather at the Apple store in Beijing's east side Sanlitun district.      The crowd erupted after the store failed to open on schedule at 7 a.m. Some threw eggs and shouted at employees through the windows.      A person with a megaphone announced the sale was canceled. Police ordered the crowd to leave and sealed off the area with yellow tape. Employees posted a sign saying the iPhone 4S was out of stock.      \\"We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd, and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, iPhone will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being,\\" said Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu.      Other Apple stores in China opened Friday and Wu said iPhone 4S quickly sold out. She said the phone still will be sold in China through Apple's online store, its local carrier China Unicom Ltd. and retailers that are authorized resellers.      Wu declined to comment on what Apple might know about scalpers buying iPhones for resale.      China is Apple's fastest-growing market and \\"an area of enormous opportunity,\\" CEO Tim Cook said in October. He said quarterly sales were up nearly four times over a year earlier and accounted for one-sixth of Apple's global sales.      Apple's iPhones are hugely popular in China and stores are mobbed for the release of new products.      iPhones are manufactured in China by an Apple contractor but new models are released in other countries first. That has helped to fuel a thriving \\"gray market\\" in China for phones smuggled in from Hong Kong and other markets.      Last May, the Sanlitun store was closed for several hours after a scuffle between an employee and a customer during the release of the iPhone 4, the previous model in the series.      Customers began gathering Thursday afternoon outside the Sanlitun store. People in the crowd said the number grew to as many as 2,000 overnight but many left before dawn after word spread that the store opening would be cancelled. There were about 350 people left when the protest erupted after 7 a.m.      \\"On the one hand there is poor organization and on the other there were just too many people,\\" said a man outside the Sanlitun store Friday, who would give only his surname, Miao. \\"I don't think they prepared well enough.\\"      Another man who refused to give his name said he was a migrant laborer who was paid 100 yuan (15) to wait in line overnight.      Others in the crowd said scalpers had organized groups of 20 to 30 migrant workers to buy phones or hold places in line. Organizers held colored balloons aloft to identify themselves to their workers.      Others said they were waiting to buy the phone for themselves.      \\"I just like the 4S,\\" said Zhu Xiaodong, a Beijing resident. He said he was upgrading from the previous iPhone 4 model.      ___      Associated Press videographer David Wivell and researcher Zhao Liang contributed.      ___      Online:      Apple Inc.: http:://http://www.apple.com ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4S launch in China led to a chaotic situation in 2012.

The Others are divided into two camps, with each Other either allied with the forces of Light or the forces of Darkness, and the prologue recounts a great battle between the two sides. Geser, the Lord of the Light, realized that the two forces would eventually annihilate each other. He stopped the battle and offered a truce to the forces of Darkness, led by Zavulon. To make sure each side honored its side of the agreement, the Light would have a \\"Night Watch\\" to monitor the forces of Darkness at night, and the Darkness would have a \\"Day Watch\\" to police the forces of Light during the day.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — In the face of a storm of controversy and a slew of challengers, U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election.      This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican.      \\"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening.      Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using 84,000 in taxpayer funds.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement.      The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold.      The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination.      Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \\"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\\"      All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career.      Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary.      Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C.      Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign.      Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment.      Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out.      But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior.      In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation.      Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble.      Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest.      A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\\"      And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson.      “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.”      “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.”      Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery      WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \\"sexualized commentary\\" in his Capitol Hill office.      The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint.      ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims      The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office.      Now Playing:      Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress.      Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for 84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay.      Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \\"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\\" she said on CNN Thursday.      Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit.      Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican.      Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \\"poor performance.\\"      Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint.      Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold.      SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation      Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation.      Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing.      The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now.      \\"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case.      After details of their 84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute.      But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March.      Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact.      In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \\"sexual fantasies\\" and \\"wet dreams\\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her.      Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \\"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\\"      Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \\"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\\"      Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \\"anger issues.\\"      She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized.      Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter.      According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \\"differently.\\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \\"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\\"      The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \\"nothing to add.\\"      In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \\"independent investigative team\\" to address the two women's concerns.      \\"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement.      \\"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\\" Daniels said.      Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \\"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\\"      Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \\"full compliance with office policy and the law.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’”      Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said.      As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an 84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation.      A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work. ||||| Summary:","output":"US Rep. Blake Farenthold is facing sexual harassment allegations and challenges from five Republicans as well as four Democrats in his bid for re-election in his 27th Congressional district. Despite the increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, Farenthold has remained defiant and has pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit. The issue sources back to 2014 when the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics recommended the U.S. House Ethics Committee to dismiss the charges against Farenthold. However, the U.S. House Ethics Committee has recently announced that it would give the allegations a closer examination.

What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different aspects of a rental situation. The first question is about the obligations of a tenant who has signed an 11-month rental agreement, while the second question pertains to the potential disadvantages faced by the house owner if a rental agreement is made for a period longer than 11 months. Question 1: Is it mandatory to stay for 11 months in a rented house if the rental agreement was made for 11 months? Answer: It is not mandatory for a tenant to stay in a rented house for the entire duration of an 11-month rental agreement. However, the agreement serves as a legally binding contract between the landlord and the tenant that stipulates the terms of the tenancy, including the duration of the lease and the conditions for lease termination. While it is not mandatory to stay for the entire lease term, it is expected that both parties honor the agreement and its terms.  In the event that a tenant wishes or needs to vacate the premises before the 11 months are up, proper communication with the landlord is essential. Tenants should review the lease terms and identify specific conditions that deal with early termination of the lease. Typically, there may be an early termination clause that may require the tenant to provide notice in advance or pay a termination fee, which could be equivalent to one or two months' rent. However, the specifics of notice period and termination fee may vary depending on the rental agreement. Question 2: What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Answer: A rental agreement for a period of more than 11 months may impose certain disadvantages on the house owner, though these disadvantages may vary depending on the regulations and laws of the specific jurisdiction. Some potential disadvantages may include the following: 1. Legal and tax implications: In certain jurisdictions, rental agreements longer than 11 months are considered long-term leases and may have different legal, tax, and stamp duty obligations than short-term leases. This may involve extra paperwork and result in higher taxation. 2. Lower flexibility: A longer lease term can limit the landlord's flexibility in adjusting rent according to changing market conditions or their own financial needs. If the rental market is experiencing growth, it may be more difficult for the landlord to increase rents if they are locked into a long-term lease agreement. 3. Difficulty in evicting problematic tenants: If a lease term is longer than 11 months, the house owner may face more difficulties in evicting a problematic tenant. Long-term lease agreements may offer stronger legal protections for tenants, making it harder for landlords to resolve issues without resorting to time-consuming and costly court proceedings. 4. Reduced ability to sell or renovate: A long-term rental agreement may limit the house owner's ability to renovate, sell, or move back into the property if circumstances change. Longer leases can complicate the selling process, especially if potential buyers want vacant possession of the property. It is important to note that these disadvantages are not universal, as laws and regulations vary between jurisdictions. House owners should consult with local legal and real estate professionals to understand the implications of a specific rental agreement term in their area."},{"instruction":"Given the question \\"Where will they have something to eat?\\" and the answer \\"In a nearby restaurant.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Living in a small town in Nevada, he spends his days working as a mechanic and his nights partaking in underground street races, holding an unbroken winning streak. One day, as Jack is working on his 1968 Ford Mustang, an anonymous letter arrives in the mail. It's an invitation for him to participate in The Royale Race, a prestigious, yet dangerously illegal racing event where the greatest drivers from around the world come to compete, with bets placed by international billionaires. The winner of this race will take home a cash grand prize of 10 million. The location of the race changes each year, and it is only revealed to those who are invited. This year, the race will take place in the breathtaking Swiss Alps within the next month. Seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Jack begins training rigorously to sharpen his driving skills. He visits his estranged older brother, Bobby, to seek guidance from an experienced racer. Bobby agrees to help and together, they prepare Jack and his Mustang for the treacherous terrain of the Alps. As the day of the race approaches, Jack learns of a cunning rival racer and the reigning champion, Victor Maverick. Victor only participates in the race under an alias which is rumored to be a famous name from the racing world. This year, the mysterious racer is rumored to use the name of Roger Moore. Jack, after considering different strategic moves, decides to take up the false identity of Roger Moore and register under it. He believes that by stealing his rival's alias, it will unnerve and intimidate Victor to think an even more skillful racer has taken his place. Jack starts referring to himself and signs into the race under the name of Roger Moore. The day of the race arrives, and the participants are introduced. Under the alias of Roger Moore, Jack lines up at the starting line with the rest of the racers, anxiously waiting for the green flag. Victor Maverick takes notice of \\"Roger Moore\\" and feels the pressure and frustration boiling inside. The race begins, and the competitors speed through the treacherous twists and turns of the Swiss Alps. The anxiety, skill, and intensity only escalate with each passing mile. Jack faces numerous challenges along the way – sabotages by rival racers, extreme weather conditions, and deceptive shortcuts that lead to dangerous drop-offs. However, his determination and brotherly bond with Bobby fuel his unwavering focus. As the finish line approaches, the rivalry between Jack and Victor reaches its culmination. A fierce duel between their vehicles leads to Victor losing control and crashing, leaving Jack ahead of the pack. Jack crosses the finish line first, claiming the title and the grand prize. In the aftermath, Jack reveals his true identity as Jack Goldfarb, earning the respect of the fellow racers, international racing community, and fans. He uses the prize money to build a better life for himself and his brother while pledging to race under his own name from that point onwards, becoming a true icon in the world of racing. The Race: Goldfarb's Gambit becomes a thrilling tale of ambition, strategy, deception, and the power of family bonds, with Jack realizing that his true identity is far more valuable than any alias."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review has a mixed opinion of the movie.

Write an article based on this summary: A scaffolder who had to have his leg and hands amputated after suffering an electric shock has had a further operation to remove his left foot.","output":"Title: The Perseverance of a Scaffolder: Overcoming Challenges with Strength and Resilience Introduction On any given workday, scaffolders face dangerous and challenging circumstances to ensure that buildings and other structures are accessible and secure for construction work. Electrical hazards are often a common risk in their line of work, accounting for a considerable number of injuries and fatalities. In this article, we will focus on the personal journey of a scaffolder who had to have his leg and hands amputated after suffering an unfortunate electric shock and how he dealt with the additional surgery to remove his left foot. The Incident The scaffolder, known for his strong work ethic and commitment to his trade, was going about his usual tasks on a construction site. The job required him to handle metal rods that served as structural frameworks for the building. Unbeknownst to him, an exposed high-voltage wire had come into dangerously close proximity to his workspace. When disaster struck, the scaffolder's world changed in an instant. In an unfortunate split second, an electrical current surged through his body as he inadvertently made contact with the exposed wire. His co-workers responded quickly, alerting emergency services and trying to provide first aid until the professionals arrived at the scene. The man was rushed to the hospital, where doctors assessed and treated his extensive injuries. Amputation and Recovery Despite the best efforts of the medical team, it became evident that the severity of his injuries would require the amputation of his leg and both his hands.

Process:  - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Coal cannot be grinded happens, how will it affect HURTING owls to hunt at night.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that coal cannot be grinded does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of owls hunting at night. Owls' hunting behavior is primarily influenced by biological and environmental factors, such as their highly developed senses of hearing and vision, and the availability of prey in their habitat. The grinding of coal is an unrelated industrial process that does not have any direct connection to owls or their hunting behavior. While it is possible that coal mining and related activities could have indirect effects on some owls through habitat destruction or pollution, the specific scenario of coal not being grindable does not influence owls' ability to hunt at night. Instead, it is more likely that changes to the habitats or ecosystems where owls live would impact their hunting behavior, rather than a specific industrial process like coal grinding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Combine like terms on the left side of the equation.    -1912 - 501 = -2413 2. The equation now becomes:    -2413 = -74v + 399 3. Next, we need to isolate the term with v, so we will subtract 399 from both sides of the equation.    -2413 - 399 = -74v + 399 - 399 4. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation.    -2812 = -74v 5. Now, to solve for v, we will divide both sides of the equation by -74.    -2812 / -74 = -74v / -74 6.

In traditional context, a hermit is a person who willingly isolates themselves from society, often to seek a spiritual purpose or clarity through solitude. As a result, it is more probable for a hermit to live in a dwelling, which can be a small, simple shelter serving as a functional living space away from urban areas, rather than any other given options. 2. Options such as \\"apartment,\\" \\"at hotel,\\" \\"condo,\\" and \\"loft\\" indicate urban or suburban housing structures that are typically close to other occupants, specifically created for social interaction or at least regular encounters with neighbors and community members. This is in direct contrast to the hermit's intended lifestyle and living arrangement. 3. The given question highlights that the hermit's living space is located \\"on the hill.\\" This geographical context reinforces the idea of the hermit seeking seclusion in a natural environment. A hill is an unlikely place for an apartment, hotel, condo, or loft, making \\"dwelling\\" the most suitable option in this situation. In conclusion, considering the hermit's preference for solitude and seclusion in a natural environment, the most logical answer is \\"dwelling,\\" as it best aligns with the hermit's lifestyle, and the other options do not suit the desired living conditions or geographical context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ghouls relentlessly search for human flesh to consume and thrive upon. A group of unlikely heroes unites to uncover the origin and purpose of these unearthly beings to save the town from complete eradication. Act I: Whispering Creek, a peaceful town surrounded by thick forests, is home to families who have lived there for generations. Rowena, a young independent investigative journalist, moves to town after inheriting her late grandmother's house. Intrigued by the town's dark history, Rowena begins digging through dusty archives at the local library. She meets Oliver, a librarian with a keen interest in the town's folklore. One night, a series of disturbances are reported at the local cemetery. The town sheriff, Alex, hesitant to involve the eccentric outsiders, grudgingly asks for Rowena and Oliver's help. They soon discover that ghouls have risen from their slumber within the Earth's depths and have started feasting on human flesh. The first victim is discovered at the cemetery, horribly mutilated and drained of all life. Act II: As the gravity of the situation sets in, the town comes together under the leadership of Sheriff Alex to devise a plan to combat the ghouls. Local legends narrate the sealing of the ghouls long ago by a band of powerful mystics where they were trapped in the underground caverns, away from human contact. However, recent mining activities have unleashed the ghouls, awakening them from their dormant state. As the feast on human flesh continues, the ghouls grow more powerful and exhibit horrifying abilities to manipulate shadows and darkness. Rowena, Oliver, and Alex come across an ancient grimoire in her grandmother's belongings that contains crucial information regarding the ghoul's weaknesses and methods to reseal them. Meanwhile, tensions rise as townspeople start disappearing one by one, including the Mayor of Whispering Creek. Act III: Armed with the information from the grimoire, Rowena, Oliver, Alex, and a small group of remaining townspeople face the ghoulish horde during the night of the new moon, when the ghouls are at their weakest. The battle is brutal and unforgiving. The heroes use traditional methods such as holy water, sacred talismans, and incantations to weaken the ghouls. Melinda, a local medic, saves the day when she discovers that a rare herb found in the surrounding forests, 'lunarsbane,' weakens the ghouls when ingested and renders them vulnerable. With the help of a community effort, the majority of the ghouls are tracked down and eliminated. The spirits of the fallen town members are honored in a ceremony led by Oliver. However, a few of the strongest ghouls manage to escape into the night. Act IV: In a final stand, Rowena, Oliver, and Alex track down the remaining ghouls to their underground lair, where they discover the Mayor has become the 'Ghoul Master' - a human who has embraced the dark powers controlling the ghouls to take revenge on the town he felt had betrayed him. Through a combination of knowledge, bravery, and teamwork, the heroes defeat the ghouls and the Ghoul Master. Using the grimoire, they enact the sealing ritual, sacrificing a part of their own life force to ensure that the ghouls remain trapped for good. As the battle is won, the three heroes vow to keep the people of Whispering Creek safe from such evil in the future. The town begins to rebuild, grateful for the return of peace and relative normalcy. Rowena decides to call Whispering Creek her permanent home, and together with Oliver and Alex, they form an alliance to safeguard their community from any supernatural threats lurking in the shadows."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The super bout between Mayweather and","output":"Manny Pacquiao in 2015 was a prime example of the negotiations and organization required from boxing promoters. In Mayweather's case, he was promoted by his own company, Mayweather Promotions, and Top Rank represented Pacquiao. Here are the steps that Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, would need to take to organize and market a fight in Nevada: 1. Identify the fighters: The first step is to identify the fighters who will be participating in the event. This includes considering their records, popularity, and potential draw for attracting viewers and ticket buyers. Based on these factors, Mayweather would select the fighters that would participate in the boxing event he wants to promote. 2. Secure the venue: With the fighters selected, Mayweather would need to book a venue for the event. In Las Vegas, popular options include the MGM Grand Garden Arena or the T-Mobile Arena. He would need to negotiate rental fees, event dates, and secure necessary permits. 3. Set the fight date: Scheduling the event date is crucial. It needs to be a date that works for the fighters, the venue, and ideally, does not conflict with other major sporting events that could deter viewers. Mayweather would coordinate with all parties to finalize an agreeable date for the fight. 4. Negotiate fighter contracts: As a promoter, Mayweather would need to negotiate and finalize contracts with the fighters. This includes determining fighter purses, the division of pay-per-view revenue, and other terms related to the event and fighter compensation. 5. Coordinate with sanctioning bodies: Mayweather would need to work with the Nevada Athletic Commission and the relevant boxing sanctioning organizations, such as the WBC or WBA, to ensure that the fight is sanctioned and abides by all necessary rules and regulations. 6. Marketing and promotion: With fighters, venue, and date confirmed, Mayweather would need to develop and execute a marketing strategy to promote the event. This could include creating promotional materials such as posters, promotional videos, and press releases, as well as coordinating press conferences or media days for additional exposure. 7. Event logistics: Mayweather, as a promoter, would be responsible for handling all event logistics, such as hiring staff and providing security, ticket sales, and accommodations for fighters and their teams. Promoters also arrange for important services like medical staff, ring announcers, and referees. 8. Insure fighters and testing: Mayweather would need to have all fighters insured against injury, as well as arrange and pay for any necessary drug testing as required by the sanctioning bodies. 9. Post-event: After the event, Mayweather would be responsible for any post-fight tasks, such as settling any financial matters, paying fighters and staff, and filing required reports with the Nevada Athletic Commission. By following these steps, Floyd Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, can effectively organize and market a fight event in Nevada and create memorable moments for fight fans worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Robert Dunne (Arthur Franz). Tough-as-nails career Marine Sergeant John Stryker (John Wayne) is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by PFC. Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway (John Agar), the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC. Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), who blames him for his demotion. When Stryker leads his squad in the invasion of Tarawa, the men begin to appreciate his methods, except Conway, who considers him brutal and unfeeling when he apparently abandons a wounded comrade to the enemy. Within the first couple of minutes of the battle, the platoon leader, Lt. Baker (Gil Herman, is killed only seconds after he lands on the beach, PFC. \\"Farmer\\" Soames (James Holden) is wounded in the leg, and PFC. Choynski (Hal Baylor) receives a head wound. The marines are aggressively pinned down by a pillbox. As a result of three unsuccessful attempts to reach the pillbox, two demolition marines and a flamethrower operator are killed and PFC. Shipley (Richard Webb) is left mortally wounded in the line of fire. Sgt. Stryker takes action and demolishes the pillbox.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima,\\" which tells the story from the viewpoint of Cpl. Robert Dunne, the narrative follows a group of Marines led by the tough Sergeant John Stryker. His rigorous training methods make him unpopular among the squad, especially with PFC. Peter Conway and PFC. Al Thomas. The movie showcases the battle in Tarawa, where the men slowly realize the importance of Stryker's training methods throughout various challenging situations. However, the question asks for the number of Japanese that must be battled in Iwo Jima. The movie portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima as one of the most significant battles in which the Marines participate. This battle was an actual historical event that took place between February 19, 1945, and March 26, 1945, involving the United States and Japan.  The Japanese forces present on the island of Iwo Jima consisted of approximately 21,000 men. These forces were primarily located in hidden bunkers and tunnels throughout the island, making it a well-fortified defense point. The American forces invading the island consisted of around 70,000 Marines.  In the movie, the events leading up to the Battle of Iwo Jima are focused on the Marines and their training, rather than providing an exact count of the Japanese forces they would come up against in battle. During the battle itself, the squad led by Sergeant Stryker would likely face numerous Japanese soldiers, but the movie does not provide specific numbers.  Therefore, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to the question regarding how many Japanese must be battled in Iwo Jima based solely on the context of the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima.\\" In real-life events, the U.S. Marines faced around 21,000 Japanese soldiers, but it is important to note that this figure applies to the overall battle and not specifically to the squad depicted in the movie."},{"instruction":"This article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music?, what is it ?

The review highlights two key things: it is affectionately goofy and a satire. Let's deconstruct these elements for a better understanding: 1. Affectionately goofy - The use of the word \\"affectionately\\" suggests that the movie has a certain warmth and that the goofiness is endearing and charming to the viewer. Goofy refers to the silly, lighthearted humor present in the movie. By stating that the movie is affectionately goofy, the critic implies that they enjoyed the humor and appreciated the warmhearted approach to it. 2. Satire - Satire is a genre of film and literature that uses humor, irony, or exaggeration to criticize or expose the flaws and follies of a particular subject, often focusing on politics, social issues, or human vices. By mentioning the movie is a satire, the critic acknowledges that the film has a deeper meaning and intent behind its humor, challenging the audience to think critically about the subject matter. Considering both of these components, it is evident that the critic sees value and enjoyment in the movie. They perceive it as a humorous, lighthearted satire that strikes a balance between entertaining the audience and making them think about a specific topic. The positive tone of the review indicates that the critic appreciated the movie for its unique blend of entertainment and thoughtfulness, making it a worthwhile experience for viewers.

Analyzing the question: The question presents an event (coup-de-etat) that happens with the aim of modifying society. We need to determine the appropriate response or outcome from the given options. 2. Examining each option: - Happiness for: Happiness as a result of a coup is potentially vague and not directly connected to the transformation of society. - New laws: While new laws can be part of the societal change process, they are not the primary driving force by themselves. - Protest: Protests can lead to change, but they are not an outcome or result in the context of a coup-de-etat seeking societal change. - Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat often involves the removal of existing leaders and the establishment of new ones. This factor could significantly impact societal change and aligns with the given context. - Cultural revolution: Although a cultural revolution can lead to changes in society, it is typically broader in nature and not a direct consequence of a coup-de-etat specifically aimed to change society. 3.

She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop... Answer:","output":"Considering the various elements of the movie plot, a possible question to generate about this story could be: How do the characters in the film deal with grief, guilt, and the uncertainty surrounding the disappearance of Alex, and how do these emotions impact their relationships and actions throughout the film? This question encourages an exploration of the emotional aspects of the story, focusing on the characters' reactions and personal growth in response to the challenging circumstances. Specifically, the question addresses the complexities of the relationships between Susan, Graham, Menetti, and other characters while they cope with the uncertainty of Alex's disappearance. Analyzing Susan's character, we can observe how she faces public scrutiny and criticism for allowing her son to walk to school alone. Despite this pressure, she remains determined to find her son and navigates the emotionally challenging situation by cooperating with the authorities and facing media attention. Her resilience and hope throughout the investigation reveal her character's strength and highlight how she bears the emotional burden of being a mother searching for her missing child. Graham, Susan's estranged husband, copes with the guilt of not being present for his son's life and tries to take matters into his own hands by investigating the ransom call. His vigilante-like actions and subsequent hospitalization further strain his relationship with Susan and the authorities, specifically Lieutenant Menetti. However, these events also demonstrate his need to find a sense of control in the face of uncertainty and the emotional weight of the situation. Lieutenant Menetti, the central figure of the investigation, experiences mounting pressure in the form of time constraints, budget cuts, and competing caseloads while attempting to solve the Selky case. Menetti's prioritization of Alex's disappearance displays his commitment to helping Susan find closure, even as his resources are limited and priorities shift to new cases. His character embodies the persistence and determination of police officers in solving such mysteries. In conclusion, exploring the emotions and dynamics of the main characters in the film, in the context of Alex's disappearance, allows for a deep understanding of how grief, guilt, and uncertainty impact the characters' lives and decisions. Moreover, it emphasizes the human element in such tragic circumstances and highlights how people cope with adversity and seek closure and answers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter. A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Carson gave Addison a piece of his mind after she stood him up.  And I was wondering Why did Carson do this? Answer:","output":"Carson's decision to give Addison a piece of his mind after she stood him up is rooted in a variety of factors, which can include the following emotional, social, and even psychological reasons: 1. Disappointment and hurt: Carson likely felt disappointed and hurt by Addison's act of standing him up. When someone is looking forward to spending time with another person and that person unexpectedly doesn't show up, it is natural to feel let down. Giving Addison a piece of his mind might have been Carson's way to express his hurt emotions and convey the impact of her action on him. 2. Confrontation of disrespectful behavior: Standing someone up is considered disrespectful, as it disregards their time and efforts to meet up. Carson might have thought it was important to address the situation and communicate his feelings about her disrespectful behavior. By doing so, he may have hoped to prevent such incidents from happening in the future and maintain better communication between them. 3. Reestablishing boundaries: When someone doesn't follow through with their plans, it can make the other person question the trust and boundaries within the relationship. By addressing Addison's behavior, Carson might have tried to reestablish clear boundaries and expectations about what is and isn't acceptable in their relationship. 4. Assertiveness and self-respect: Carson might have felt the need to be assertive and stand up for himself. Doing so can help maintain one's self-respect and ensure that others understand that their time and feelings are valuable. Confronting Addison about her act of standing him up may have allowed Carson to express that he respects his own worth and would not tolerate such behavior without addressing it. 5. Encouraging communication and understanding: By voicing his concerns, Carson aimed to open the lines of communication with Addison and seek clarity on why she stood him up. By understanding and addressing the reasons behind her actions, both parties would have the opportunity to work through any issues and improve their relationship. 6. Catharsis and emotional release: Sometimes, expressing one's feelings about a disappointing or hurtful situation can provide relief and aid in healing. By openly discussing the incident with Addison, Carson may have experienced a sense of closure or relief from the emotions that were triggered by her standing him up. In conclusion, Carson's decision to give Addison a piece of his mind was likely driven by various factors that include emotional hurt, asserting self-respect, confronting and discouraging disrespectful behavior, reestablishing boundaries within the relationship, opening lines of communication, and seeking catharsis from the whole incident. Different people react differently to similar situations depending on their personality, past experiences, and expectations. It is important to remember that establishing clear communication and understanding between individuals can help resolve conflicts and nurture healthier relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lisa Marie was born on February 1, 1968, to Elvis and Priscilla Presley at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, nine months to the day after her parents' May 1, 1967, wedding. After her parents divorced, she lived with her mother. When her father died in 1977, 9-year-old Lisa Marie became joint heir to his estate with her grandfather Vernon Presley and her great-grandmother Minnie Mae Presley. Following the deaths of Vernon in 1979 and Minnie Mae in 1980, she became the sole heir and inherited Graceland. Lisa Marie Presley was indoctrinated into the Church of Scientology in 1977 by her mother, Priscilla. Priscilla had discovered books pertaining to Scientology among the belongings of her ex-husband, Elvis Presley, after his death on August 16, 1977.  In October 1997, Presley, along with friend and fellow Memphian and Scientologist Isaac Hayes, opened the Literacy, Education and Ability Program (LEAP). LEAP is run by Applied Scholastics, a group run by Scientologists.  On January 5, 2002, Presley received the Humanitarian Award from the World Literacy Crusade for her efforts to help children across America learn valuable skills for study and improve their lives. Lisa Marie Presley received her award from Isaac Hayes, Chaka Khan and Yolanda King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr. World Literacy Crusade is regarded by critics as a front group for the Church of Scientology. On September 26 of that same year Lisa Marie Presley addressed a Congressional hearing in opposition to the use of medication in treating ADHD, stating: \\"I have spoken to children who have been forced to take a cocaine-like stimulant to control their behavior; I have shared their sense of sheer desperation. Children have been wrenched from their family's care simply because their parents favored an alternative, drug-free approach to addressing educational and behavioral problems. The psychotropic drugging of millions of children has to stop.\\" These views reflected her beliefs as a Scientologist. Addressing the Committee as the International Spokesperson for Children's Rights, for the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a group run by Scientologists, Presley expressed her view that parents should be informed about alternatives to drugs so they may \\"make an informed choice about their child's educational and medical needs\\".

But before they do, we just wanted to make sure they all knew that their proposal ideas are terrible and not nearly elaborate enough.      That cute idea of making a “Will You Marry Me?” ugly Christmas sweater with the ring literally sewn into place above your heart simply won’t do. Why not?

Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in.

Options: + chance level; + motion; + vector count; + entropy; Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Scientists use a quantity called __________ as a measure of disorder, or randomness.   A: A:","output":"Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, it provides a way to quantify the amount of disorder present in a system. It was first introduced by the physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics states that in an isolated system, natural processes tend to progress in a direction that leads to an increase in disorder or randomness, also known as an increase in entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations a system can have, given its macroscopic properties such as temperature, volume, and energy. In simpler terms, it accounts for the variety of ways particles can be arranged or distributed among individual energy levels. A system with a low entropy value has only a few possible states, which means the particles are organized and structured. On the other hand, a system with a high entropy value has many possible states, which means the particles are disordered and less structured.  It is crucial to note that entropy is not an inherent property of an object or a system, but rather depends on the observer's choice of macroscopic variables to describe the system. In this sense, an increase in entropy can be understood as an increase in the amount of information needed to describe a system fully. In practical applications, entropy often helps scientists and engineers understand and predict various processes that involve the transfer of heat, such as heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and heat pumps. It can also be applied in other fields, including information theory, where entropy represents the minimum amount of data required to transmit a message optimally, and in the study of complex systems, where entropy can describe the level of uncertainty or instability present in those systems. Overall, entropy is a crucial concept that allows scientists to quantify and analyze the degree of disorder in various systems. By understanding and predicting the way systems evolve from order to chaos, researchers can better understand the fundamental properties of our universe and develop more effective technologies for harnessing and controlling energy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script--the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas--as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. Context: The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.  During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.  In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown. Question: Was there a population of these cities? Answer:","output":"Yes, there was a population in the cities of the Maya civilization during the Preclassic period. The development of sedentary communities, establishment of settlements, and growth of small villages into cities, as seen with Nakbe, El Mirador, and Tikal, are indications that there were populations inhabiting these cities. These populations engaged in agriculture, cultivating staple crops, and participated in the cultural aspects such as the creation of pottery, fired clay figurines, and the development of the early Maya script."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me break both questions down and explain the subjects they are referring to: Question 1: \\"Can I use the Pac-man character with teeth for my own game?\\" This question is about the legality and copyright issue of using a specific character, the Pac-man, in a personal game project. Steps to address this question: 1. Research the ownership and copyright of the Pac-man character. 2. Determine if there are any licensing options available for using the character. 3. Consult legal resources or professionals to confirm the possibility of using the character in a personal game project without violating copyright. Question 2: \\"Can anyone get any government college through MAT?\\" This question is related to education, specifically asking about the possibility of securing admission in a government college by means of the Management Aptitude Test (MAT) scores. Steps to address this question: 1. Identify the government colleges that accept MAT scores during their admission process. 2. Understand minimum score requirements and other eligibility criteria at the respective colleges. 3. Research the admission process of the selected colleges and prepare accordingly. Since both questions talk about unrelated subjects: one about using a character in their game while the other one about college admissions via an aptitude test, they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Article: If you struggle to feel secure in a relationship, practice good communication skills. Ask people to speak directly and honestly to you without using sarcasm. When you speak with others, put most of your energy on listening to what they say and understanding them. If you're unclear about something, ask a question. Overall, be curious in your interactions and avoid jumping to conclusions. If you start to doubt what the person is doing or saying, ask a question. However, don't be accusing. For example, if your partner is going out and you're feeling suspicious, ask, “Do you know what time you'll be back? I was hoping we could spend some time together tonight.” If you generally tend to be untrusting toward people, this likely affects your ability to have friendships and relationships. While it's true some people shouldn't be trusted, it doesn't mean that everyone is not trustworthy. Think about what it costs you when you doubt someone; their time, their presence, their love, and perhaps even their friendship.  For example, if someone calls and says they will be late, then it simply means they are running late and nothing more. Even if there is a pattern of lateness, it doesn't mean they're up to something else based solely on this one trait, however much you dislike it. If you're having a hard time believing someone, say to yourself, “I am choosing to believe they are telling me the truth.” Maybe an ex cheated on you and now you're wary of dating or being with someone new for fear they may also betray you. Living in the past is not a healthy way to direct your present and future behavior. Avoid letting past bad experiences cloud your present judgment, and learn how to stop yourself from falling into automatic suspicious responses whenever a similar situation arises. Rebuilding trust starts with you, not anybody else. Learn from your past experiences and improve your resilience, but use the past like a stepping stone rather than a weight dragging you down. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of good communication skills and trust in maintaining healthy relationships.

Orlando City SC were an American professional soccer team based in Orlando, Florida, United States that was the precursor to Orlando City SC.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015. The team initially known as Orlando City Soccer Club, played in the USL Pro, which was the third tier of the American soccer pyramid from 2010 to 2014. Orlando City SC was the precursor to the Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise, which was established in Orlando in 2015. The founders and ownership group behind Orlando City SC had ambitions to bring professional soccer to a higher level, and they saw the MLS as the right platform for this goal. The MLS launched an expansion initiative in the early 2010s, and Orlando City SC actively pursued a spot in the top-tier league. The ownership group, led by Flavio Augusto da Silva and Phil Rawlins, worked diligently to secure the necessary financial and political commitments, including plans for a new soccer-specific stadium in downtown Orlando. Eventually, the efforts of the ownership group paid off. In November 2013, MLS Commissioner Don Garber announced that Orlando City SC would become the league's 21st franchise, set to begin its first MLS season in 2015. The transition from USL Pro to MLS meant radical changes to the organization, including a new team roster and a rebranding effort in terms of identity and team colors. This rebranding marked the end of the previous Orlando City SC and led to the birth of the new MLS franchise team under the same name. Therefore, with the ambitions of playing in the top-tier league being realized through the establishment of the Major League Soccer expansion franchise, the previous version of Orlando City SC that had competed in the USL Pro from 2010 to 2014 no longer existed and was effectively dissolved in 2015. The current Orlando City SC that plays in the MLS is structurally different from the earlier version, although the name and some core elements have been retained in order to maintain continuity and build upon the growing fan base and soccer community in Orlando."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the given premise, it is essential to analyze the structure and logical relationship between both statements. Let's first break down the premise and hypothesis to understand them better. Premise: \\"As the UAW (United Auto Workers) members at Caterpillar have learned, if the stakes are high enough, Wall Street can be very, very patient.\\" - This statement suggests that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned that Wall Street can display immense patience when the stakes are high. Hypothesis: \\"The UAW members at Caterpillar learned nothing.\\" - This statement contradicts the premise and implies that the UAW members at Caterpillar have not learned anything. In the context of logical reasoning, a conclusion can be derived when the premise leads to or supports the validity of the hypothesis. In this case, we can observe that the premise and the hypothesis are in direct opposition to each other. The premise affirms that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned about Wall Street's patience, while the hypothesis negates this idea by claiming that they have learned nothing. Given the contradictory nature of the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.
