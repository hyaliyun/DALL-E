And it always happens when you're least expecting it. It creeps up on you and jumps on you out of the blue, It grabs you by the throat, shakes you and says, ‘I'm here! You'd better take notice of me!” I mean, think about it. One minute you're going along very nicely, thank you. You get up every morning for work and you come home every evening, You make dinner. You watch your favourite TV program on Tuesdays and ‘Thursdays. You go out, you come in, You have a drink on Friday nights. The highlight of your week is lunch out on Sundays. Thav’s life as you know it. At least you think you're alive, but then real life comes along and does a little dance in front of you and you realize that you've been half dead. ‘Thar’s the way it was when I met Ria. One minute I was just going along like this, bored but kind of OK. Well at lease I was healthy. Next thing I knew Twas out late at night, freezing to death, doing all kinds of strange things. And it seemed to me that I just had to do them; somehow I didn't have any choice. Now I don't know about you, but there’s a certain pattern to my falling in love. First of all, it always happens in winter, so it’s freezing cold, October, November and December are the usual months, and they're cold in Holland, really cold. And in The Hague the wind comes off the sea and goes right through you like a knife. Not the kind of weather for hanging around on street corners or in telephone boxes, but that’s always what I end up doing. One day I’m going to bed at nine thirty with a good book, the next 'm out at one o'clock in the morning, knowing that I’m going to be exhausted the next day. Exhausted, but excited. Then comes a cold, or even worse, flu. Pd like to fall in love in summer, but it never happens that way. Then there’s the poetry. Suddenly I start writing poetry; it just pours out of me. And it’ all deep meaningful scuff that has to be written in the early hours of the morning, usually accompanied by lots of alcohol. So the next day, on top of the cold I already have, I have a hangover from the drink. It’s a miracle that my bass hasn’t sacked me. ‘And the worst bit is when I realise that there’s probably another man in her life. And of course he’s really good- looking and has a sports car and a big bank account. So everything followed more or less the usual pattern with Ria, First came the cold and the poems. I hadn't seen the good-looking boyfriend yet, but I had the feeling that it was just a matter of time. There was something about Ria that was different, though. She was different from other gitls. First of all there was her job. She was a tram driver. But lec me tell you a little bie about myself, because no doubt you're wondering what an English guy is doing living in Holland, in The Hague to be exact. Well, my name’s Harry Brent, I'm twenty-nine and I've been here for ‘wo years. I work for an international import and export company, JGD. They're based in Manchester but have offices all over Europe. They sent me here to work in their Dutch office. I'll probably be here for another two or three years. Import and export. Sounds kind of boring, eh? Well, it’s OK really, and Holland is an interesting country. For one thing, you can more or less do what you want here, I mean, it’s very liberal, very tolerant. And although I don’t really do much that’s exciting, if you know what I mean, I like it. I like the atmosphere and just the thought that if I wanted to take all my clothes off in the middle of the street, no one would care. No. No one would even notice. So, like I say, I live in The Hague. It’s not as beautiful or as exciting as Amsterdam, but it has its advantages. The best thing about it is that its near a place called Scheveningen, which is almost unpronounceable but lovely. Ie has long soft sandy beaches, which are wonderful for walks. And the sea here, the North Sea, is just beautiful, a soft blue-grey. I go to the beach a lot. The traffic in The Hague is pretty bad, but it has good public transport. The noisy red trams and their rails are a familiar sight and that’s how I get about. Number one to work, number three to the city centre. And number eleven from my place down to the beach. I live alone in one of those typical tall Dutch houses on a little street between the city centre and the beach. I often go down to the beach after work and at weekends, to walk and relax and look at the sea, Which brings me back to Ria, I first noticed Ria when I was going to the beach on tram cleven one Sunday afternoon. It was early October and a beautiful cold bright day. The tram suddenly stopped somewhere in the middle of nowhere; something was stuck on the rails, Ie happens a lot, and I didn’t take much notice until I looked out of the window and saw the tram driver removing a small piece of wood. Now, you can get on a tram in Holland without seeing the driver, and that’s exactly what I'd done. But now I saw her, I couldn't take my cyes off her. ['ve never seen a tram driver wear a uniform as well as Ria did. She was tall and slim. And even from a distance I could see that she was beautiful, with long dark hair. Really attractive. She was wearing a skirt, unlike most female tram drivers who usually wear trousers. ‘And she had legs that seemed to go on forever. Yeah, she was different. But the most amazing thing about Ria was her eyes, which I noticed straight away, and which were the exact colour of the North Sea, a lovely soft blue-grey. And those eyes kind of grabbed me, that’s the only way T can put it, so that I couldn't think of anything else. Pd been grabbed by the throat. ‘Well, she got back into the tram and we carried on towards the beach. I moved up the tram so that I could be nearer to her. And I just looked at her all the way to the beach, though I tried not to let her see. I was kind of dazed, as if I'd been hit on the head. I was confused, I don’t mind telling you. ‘Anyway, the number eleven stops at the beach, on the south side of Scheveningen not too far from the port; it’s the end of the tramline, It waits for ten or fifteen minutes, turns round and goes back to the city. I got out and just sort of hung around for a while, looking at Ria but pretending I wasn't looking. The idea of going away was scary; I might never see her again. After a few minutes, Ria got out of the tram and talked for a while to another tram driver, That's when I discovered that she was called Ria, because I heard him shout something to her. It looked like she was going to drive tram eleven back to the city. Thad a little time so I went over to the other side of the road and bought some chips from a little shop near the beach, keeping my eyes on the tram, and Ria, all the time. Then I walked back slowly to the tram, eating my chips and mayonnaise — 1 know it's a strange combination, bur I've got used to it. I got back on the tram and went back to the city with Ria. So that was it really. For the next two weeks I spent all of my spare time on trams, especially on tram eleven, hoping that she would be the driver, and that I'd get to see her. I got to love that little red tram; it was kind of comforting. I also spent a lot of time waiting for trams, which is when I got the cold. I got to know her routine, and I managed to see a lot of her one way or another, And at nights I would go home to my house and write poetry. ‘Anyway, one late afternoon I was waiting for the tram on the platform. Ie pulled up and, as luck would have it, Ria was driving. I was feeling kind of brave that particular day, and I got on at the front, just so I could really see her. As I got on, she smiled at me and said, ‘goede middag’ which means, ‘Good afternoon,’ Well, not so unusual you might think, but I knew when she said it that she recognised me. Ie was the way her eyes met mine. I don’t remember much about that tram ride, I can tell you! I could feel my face burning red. I was completely overcome with ie all. I kepe reliving that moment when she had said ‘goede middag’ for days afterwards. Well, from then on we said hello to each other quite often. I was working towards asking her out, you know, kind of trying to find the courage. Finally, one Friday evening, I knew I had to go for it. For one thing, it was starting to look very strange, you know, me following her around like that. I didn’t want anyone to think I was some kind of weird guy who follows women — you know, a stalker or something. So this particular Friday evening T left work at six o'clock as usual, What I needed was a drink, I thought. Otherwise there was no way I could talk to Ria, not really talk, I mean. The office where I work is near the centre of the city, on a street called Korte Voorhout, so I decided to go to the Dudok. Irs a big new bar just a few minutes’ walk away. A cool kind of place, if you know what I mean. A fashionable place to be seen. I sometimes went there for a quick drink after work, just because its near the office. The Dudok was already crowded; it was a popular spot for an carly evening drink, what the Dutch call a borrel. Yeah, it was definitely borrel time. I found a place at the bar and drank a couple of beers quickly. There was a new barman there, a friendly sort of bloke who came over and started chatting, ‘English, ch?” he asked. Turned out his brother had gone to work in London, I didn't have the heart to tell him Td never been there. I mean, just Heathrow airport. So I just nodded when he mentioned Notting Hill and Chiswick. ‘Lovely part of London, Chiswick,’ he said. ‘Gorgeous,’ I said. ‘Another beer?” ‘Er, Yd better not,’ I said weakly. ‘Come on,’ he said. ‘Its. . . how do you say it. . .? On the house.’ ‘Anyway, he was a friendly guy, like I said. He kept coming over to talk to me from time to time, and I kept drinking. I was thinking about whar I was going to say to Ria, to be honest, and I wasn't getting very far. After about an hour, he asked me, ‘So, what are you doing all alone on a Friday evening, Harry? By then we were on first-name terms. His was Hans. Well, Id had a few beers by then, so I told him about Ria. I told him about tram eleven and the fact that fd decided to try to get to know her and to ask her out. Hans smiled at me with big round eyes. ‘Oh, well, good luck, Harry? he said. ‘And I hope she doesn’t disappoint you. They say that Dutch women are really strong! You take care of yourself? Funny thing to say, I thought, Anyway, I had a few more beers, and before I knew it was eleven o'clock! I felt like I knew London like the back of my hand, bur that wasn't the point. The point was to talk to Ria and ask her out, I told myself, It was time to get on tram eleven. I wasn't totally drunk, though I must say I'd had enough. I said goodbye to the barman and ran off to catch tram one so that I could get on tram eleven at the Hollands Spoor Station. On the platform I stood where the front of the tram would stop to make sure that it was Ria driving, The first driver was a man, some big blond guy with a moustache, so I waired for the next. Ah, there she was! She looked as attractive as ever, with those lovely North Sea eyes. I got on at the back of the tram this time. I didn’t want her to see me before I was ready, if you know what I mean. I put my tram ticket in the little machine and sat right at the back. It was late October by now and it was really cold and windy. As a matter of fact, it’s always windy in The Hague. But the moon was up and it was nice and clear. I still wasn't sure how I was going to approach her but, like I said, I had to try, Well, I sat there and sat there and I couldn't think of a way to talk to her — I mean, say more than ‘Good evening.’ What do you say? ‘Do you come here often?” I just couldn't imagine myself asking her, if you know what I mean. Truth is, I'm not very good with women, I suppose. So, before I knew it, we were at the beach and everybody had to get off, There were about ten people on the tram, mostly people who lived up there, I reckoned, and they all got off and walked away pretty quickly. I got off quickly too so thar Ria wouldn't see me. T went and stood behind the tram shelter, where I could see her but she couldn't see me. It was obvious from the way that she collected her stuff together that she was going off duty. I tried to think of a way of hanging around for a while and kept my eye on her. Then, she said something to another tram driver who was going to take the tram back to the city centre and then she set off walking quickly in the direction of the port. I didn't know what to do, to be honest, seeing her go like that, s0 I followed her. Oh, I know it looked like I was stalking her, which is exactly what I said I didn’t want to do, But it seemed like my only choice. Like I said, love is a dangerous emotion. Well, by now the wind was blowing up a storm over the North Sea and the sky was full of huge black clouds, Dutch weather is like that old joke: ‘If you don’t like it, just wait a while and it'll change.’ The sky reminded me of one of those paintings you see at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, painted by Rembrandt or Vermeer or someone. It wasn’t raining yet, but it was only a matter of time. I kept quite far behind Ria, Well, I didn’t have much choice, to be honest. She was a very fast walker! She kept up a quick pace along the seafront, trying to get home before the storm blew up, I suppose. I was almost running, just to keep her in sight! I suppose I was drunk too, to be honest, and it’s hard to move fast when you've drunk too much. There were a few people still around, coming out of the bars and restaurants in Scheveningen and walking to their cars, or just taking the sea air. I didn't look too strange, It was about midnight by now. I was thinking to myself ‘this is stupid,’ and telling myself that I was a coward but, like T say, T couldn't help ir. The beach front at Scheveningen is long, and there's a kind of wide path that goes right down towards the port. That was obviously where Ria was heading, so I was thinking that she had to live somewhere near the port. Part’ of the old fishing village, the original Scheveningen, is down there. So I carried on walking, following her. The weather at the beach changes pretty quickly, like I said, and, sure enough, before long it started raining quite hard, that kind of horizontal rain you get around here. I didn’t have an umbrella of course, so soon I was completely soaked. After about twenty minutes’ walk, we got near the port, At the beginning of the port area, there are a lot of fish restaurants and small bars. But by now they were almost all closed, and the place was nearly deserted. Ria looked round at one point, but I was far enough away that she couldn't recognize me. Then we got into the port itself. There were quite a few boats there: a few local fishing boats, and some ships with the names of English ports on them. Around the harbour itself it was pretty dark, and the only noise I could hear was the sound of Ria’s heels on the pavement. Right in the corner of the harbour there's a little bar called De Hoek. It’s a place where the fishermen go, and some Scheveningen locals. Td never been in there myself, though I'd heard people at the office talk about it. It had a reputation as a wild kind of place. It was still open; I could see a kind of dim yellow light and there was music and voices coming from inside. I looked at my watch. It was one o'clock! It was late, but the bar was so far away from any houses thar it could probably stay open as long as it liked, I thought. ‘Anyway, Ria walked over towards it, opened the door and went right in. Odd, I thought. Did she live there, or was she just going in for a quick drink before bed? Hard to say. By now the rain had died down a bit, so I decided to wait a little longer. Well, I was already wet through so it didn’t marter. Yeah, | know it sounds crazy, but that’s what Itold you. You do strange things when you'r in love. So I waited quite a while, My mind was working overtime, I can tell you. Did she live here, or did her boyftiend live here? There had to be a boyfriend. Perhaps he was a fisherman or sailor! A good-looking sailor with a sports car and a big bank account of course. That would be just my luck. So there I was, waiting. And I thought, ‘Hey, I haven't got anything to lose.’ You know what I mean? So what if she’s got a boyfriend? It can't be any worse than standing out here, dripping wet and shivering. By now I was like a dog that had just come out of the sea. And it looked like it was going to start raining again. So I walked over to the bar and opened the old wooden door. ‘The only things I noticed at first were the overpowering smell of cigars, and a fair amount of smoke. I could hear music playing too, sounded like jazz, I looked around, trying to see Ria. ‘Are you sure you want to come in here?” I looked up into the face of a huge Dutch guy. He was standing right next to me blowing smoke in my face. ‘Er, I’m not sure,’ I answered. ‘Well, decide,’ he said. ‘The bar was full of people, men mainly, though there were a couple of women too. I looked around for Ria, but I couldn't see her anywhere. I moved away from the tall Dutchman and pushed through the crowd towards the bar. ‘As I moved through the smoke I could see a kind of stage on the other side of the room. And on the stage someone was dancing to the music. After a minute or so, my eyes got used to the smoke and the dim light, and I could see the dancer. It took me a little while to work out that she was completely naked! Well, I didn't know where to look, I can tell you. The big Durch guy was looking at me, smiling and watching for my reactions. I sort of smiled back. To be honest, I wanted to leave. I felt kind of embarrassed. But I didn’t want to seem foolish or anything, so I acted like it was the most natural thing in the world. I ordered a beer, though it was the last thing I wanted, to tell you the truth. I just wanted to run out of there, Ria or no Ria. Then the music stopped and everyone clapped. ‘Oh good,’ I thought, ‘this is my chance to get out of here.’ But the music started again almost immediately and someone else came onto the stage. ‘Look at this,’ said the big Dutch guy, pushing my elbow. ‘You'l like this! I smiled kind of awkwardly, and looked over to the little stage and at the face of the new dancer. She was wearing a bit more make-up than usual, but there was no mistaking those eyes. It was Ria! ‘Well, I was shocked, I can tell you! But it got worse. The music started and Ria started taking her clothes off Everyone in the bar was shouting and whistling. Part of me wanted to leave, but the other part just made me stay there. I couldn't move. Little by litte, Ria’s clothes came off until she was completely naked. And then came the greatest shock of all, because then I saw that there was something about Ria that was different. She was different from other girls. And ie wasnt only that she was a tram driver. She was aman! ‘Aaagh!’ I sort of screamed and moved quickly towards the door. ‘See what I mean?’ said the big Dutch guy behind me, laughing. I ran outside. The Dutch guy followed me, shouting, “So, you like our entertainment, do you, little English boy?” Abit rude, I thought, calling me ‘litde’, but I thoughe Pd lec it pass, I ran as fast as I could. I ran all the way back home. I couldn't help thinking about what Hans had said about ‘strong women’, He didn’t know how right he was. Yeah, there are times when life comes and grabs you by the throat. So, all that happened about six months ago. Since then, things have, well, calmed down a bit. I get up every morning for work and I come home every evening. I make dinner. I watch my favourite TV program on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I go out, I come in. I have a drink on a Friday night. The highlight of my week is lunch out on Sundays. OK, it’s boring, but to tell the truth T kind of like it. Pm happy. But I'm really not looking forward to the winter.","output":"Summary: The text narrates the story of Harry Brent, an Englishman living in Holland, who works for an import and export company in The Hague.

Teikoku's] subsequent establishment and [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's] growth into the Galaxy's hyperpower [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's current state] starting [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's rise to power and dominance |the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku| of the Milky Way] in the earlier stages of the latter's [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] fall and [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] eventual subsquent dissolution. The Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium has its [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] canon civilian and military technologies with the Star Wars humans having the same psychic and magical powers and hyper-intelligence as the Primoris prognatus in canon Halo in addition to the Primoris prognatus' canon civilian and military technologies and the same being true for the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku and the Covenant. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also replaces the galaxy-spanning paramilitary force/meritocratic military organization/pirate guild lead by the infamous race of horned extraterrestrial warmongers known as the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z], the Planetary Trade Organization [Dragon Ball Z] in this fic, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku in this fic] also having the PTO's technology, weapons and equipment, with the Juraians [Tenchi Muyo], a humanoid extraterrestrial race [the Jurians] of psychics and magic users good at electronics and mechanics [the Jurians], who [the Juraians] are the ruling caste and the dominant force in the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's politics, royalty and aristocracy [the Juraians] replacing the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z] and [the Jurians] also having the Frost Demons' swordsmanships and qi/ki manipulation abilities in addition to their [the Juraians'] own canonical abilities and skills, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku replacing the PTO and the Jurians replacing the Frost Demons in this fic] thus making them [the Juraians in this story] the masters [the Juraians in this story] of the naturally aggressive warrior race descended from Great Apes who gained intelligence and took on a humanoid form who, since ancient times, have lived a violent and inhumane lifestyle, where they attack numerous planets to build up wealth and goods, the Saiyans [Dragon Ball Z], [the Juraians being the masters of the Saiyans in this fic] and [the Juraians in this fic] using the Saiyans to conquer and clean out multiple planets not just across the Milky Way, but across the various galaxies for them [the Juraians in this fic]. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also maintains control of the Jikū Kanri Kyoku [Time-Space Administrative Bureau |Jikū Kanri Kyoku|], an interdimensional security force [Jikū Kanri Kyoku] and full-out military force [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] formed [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] jointly by a union of several worlds that [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] also monitors cultural growth and provides disaster relief to each world under the JKK's jurisdiction especially when it involves magic and the magical items of tremendous power that are legacies of collapsed civilizations known as Lost Logia [Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha] , [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] from Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha in this story. The descendant of low-class warrior Saiyans imprinted with only enough training to fight and conquer, Kakkarot [Dragon Ball franchise] is [Kakkarot] still [Kakkarot] sent to Earth to [Kakkarot] conquer it [Earth] sometime in the 500 AD period of human history as a baby, [Kakkarot] being [Kakkarot] adopted by Grandpa Gohan [Dragon Ball] after his [Kakkarot's] spaceship crashlanded on a hyperadvanced, semi-spacefaring version of ancient Earth, more specifically in the Han Chinese Imperial House of Yang-ruled Great Sui State/Sui dynasty ruling over Han China and [Kakkarot] being given the Chinese name of 'Sun Wukong' by Grandpa Gohan. After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs [Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z] and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled absolute imperial dynastic monarchy of the Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 21th century via [Wukong] taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, [Trunks's descendants] subsequently being absorbed into the Japanese as the centuries go on. Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire is [the Japanese Empire in this fic] restored [the Japanese Empire in this fanfic] as the government [the Japanese Empire] of Japan after the series of natural disasters, continent-wide wars and nuclear exchanges resulting in flames exploding around the world, devastating it [Earth] and leaving most parts of the planet uninhabitable, with continents being torn apart and some nations being utterly obliterated known as the Great Cataclysm [Fire Force], which [the Great Cataclysm in this story] is [the Great Cataclysm in this story] the same even as the global intercontinental military conflict and power bloc war within the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe that lasted from 2045 to 2064 and started as a result of a military conflict between the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled unitary presidential republic of the Russian Federation ruling over Siberia and the Russian Far East from Russia and the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Greater Manchuria over immigration due to global cooling starting around 2030 which was already worsened by advanced agricultural production becoming a solar-powered industry in 2020, leading to a temporary population boom [the conflict which lasted from 2045 to 2064 in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe] known as the Third World War [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] and the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], [the Third World War in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe being the same as the Great Cataclysm from Fire Force and the Invertia from Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku in this story] with the

the Ōtsutsuki clan] acting as this neo-Japanese Empire's imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] fleeing [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] from the hidden-from the rest of the world, mythical, stuck on the feudal era of Japanese and the Ming and Song dynasty era of Chinese history politically, socially and economically, having the mythical combination of ki/qi and spiritual energy known as chakra-using fake shinobi and wuxia style cultivator mega continent known as the Elemental Nations [Naruto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] setting in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] being [what happened to the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] mistaken for [what the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic were |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| mistaken |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| for] the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, the real-life Japanese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato] by [who mistook the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the Imperial House of Great Yamato] the residents of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, this mistake [the residents of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto mistaking the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the surviving remnants of Imperial House of Great Yamato left in post-Great Cataclysm Japan] allowing it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] to [the Ōtsutsuki clan this fanfic] rebuild its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's in this fanfic's] new home [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] use it [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] as a base [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] for the eventual annhilation, conquest, absorption and assmilation of the myriad warlord states, bandit hideouts and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm, [the assimilation of the myriad of warlord states, bandit fiefdoms and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm by the fortified, rebuilt, restructured and rejuvinated post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] ending with the conquest and subsequent assmilation of the de-jure constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy but de facto theocratic industrial theocratic city state of the Raffles-dynasty ruled Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in post-Great Cataclysm Tokyo into the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule, which [the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] marked the reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule and the end of the post-Great Cataclysm warlord era in Japan. The creatures of Grimm [human and supernatural eating carnivorous monsters |Grimm| that |Grimm| do not |what the Grimm do not have| possess a soul, |the Grimm| being |what happens to the Grimm| drawn towards |what attracts the Grimms’ presence| negative emotions such as jealously, grief, loneliness, hatred and fear, |the Grimms’ attraction to negativity| causing them |the Grimms| to often congregate on the source of these emotions, |the Grimm| attacking any humans and supernatural creatures they |the Grimm| encounter on sight, |the Grimm| from |the media franchise the Grimm are (the Grimm) from| RWBY] also emerge after the Great Cataclysm all over the world along with the Infernals [former humans that spontaneous combust and |the Infernals| become |what the Infernals become after spontaneous combustion| misshapen fiery charcoal-like monsters, the Infernals being |what the Infernals are| a common feature and |the Infernals| a ever-present threat |the Infernals| in the post-Great Catalclysm world, |the Infernals| being |the Infernals| from |the franchise the Infernals are (the Infernals) from Fire Force] and the Gastrea [deadly parasites |Gastrea| that |Gastrea| transform |who Gastrea transform| their |the Gastrea’s| victims into |what the Gastrea transform their (the Gastrea’s victims) into mutated, superhuman, human-eating, powerful monsters (the endstage of a Gastrea infection), |the Gastrea| from |the media franchise the Gastrea are (the Gastrea) from| Black Bullet] Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. The reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule allows for the quick reconstruction and rebuilding of the country [Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule] and pre-Great Cataclysm luxuries such as electricity, bullet trains, the internet and running water soon return to Japan due to the merger of the Great Tokyo Empire's steampunk and dieselpunk technology with the advanced extraterrestrial technology and industry from brought from Jurai and the surviving pre- Great Cataclysm Japanese, American and even Russian technology left behind. In fact, the seizure of the unimaginably powerful flame or energy that be used to bring both creation and destruction, not connected to the physical laws of Earth but connected to collective minds, emotions, and perceptions of humanity known as the Adolla Burst [Fire Force]-powered infinite energy providing thermal-powered generator located in the Central Ward of the Tokyo Empire, the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" [Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \\"Amaterasu\\" |Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"|] from [the media franchise the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" is |the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"| from] Fire Force, [the seizure of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] during the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule is what will prove useful in the stability of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire. The Ōtsutsuki soon discover the presence of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, very manipulative, volatile and misanthropic nature Adolla Burst having survivor of the Great Cataclysm known only as Amaterasu [Fire Force] inside the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" after the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule and [the Ōtsutsuki] quickly rescue Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\", [ The Ōtsutsuki rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] copying her [Amaterasu's] Adolla Burst and placing the copy [of Amaterasu's Adolla Burst] inside the the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" to power it [ the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] while [The Ōtsutsuki after |The Ōtsutsuki| rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] scanning her [Amaterasu's] memories and [The Ōtsutsuki] discovering the presence of the extraterrestrial god-like entity with immense reality warping powers known only as the Evangelist [Fire Force] and its [the Evangelist's] cult organization with the goal of recreating the Great Cataclysm, the White Clad [Fire Force] within the Great Tokyo Empire's territories. The Ōtsutsuki soon begin constructions of replicas of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" all through post-Great Cataclysm Japan. Japan's Bicameral national legislature with the ability to pass laws and also to nominate the Japanese prime minister, consisting of a lower house, called the House of Representatives and an upper house, the House of Councillors, which [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] are [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] directly elected under a parallel voting system, the National Diet, [the National Diet] also resumes operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. In fact the bill that restores the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is passed through the National Diet. Japan’s central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system responsible for supervising Japan’s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters, under the Japanese Cabinet Office commission responsible for guaranteeing the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration, the National Public Safety Commission of the Japanese Cabinet Office, the Japanese National Police Agency, the elite tactical unit equivalent to the US Delta Force/US CIA SOG black ops death squads of the Japanese police force maintained by individual Japanese prefectural police forces and supervised by the Japanese National Police Agency and also national-level counterterrorism unit that cooperates with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads, the Special Assault Team, post-WW2's Japan's domestic intelligence agency administered by the Japanese Ministry of Justice tasked with internal security and espionage against threats to Japanese national security, contributing to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations, the Public Security Intelligence Agency and the post-WW2 Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet, reporting directly to the Japanese Prime Minister, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, [the Japanese NPA, the SAT, PISA and CIRO] soon resume their [the Japanese NPA's, the SAT's, PISA's and CIRO's] respective operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] along with the JSDF's special forces unit with a mission of infiltration into enemy territory, reconnaissance, sabotage, and hostage rescue, and conducting military operations against guerrillas or enemy commandos during wartime, the Special Forces Group, [the JSDF and SFG] also return to full operational capacity after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. SOG and SAT teams accompanied by PIRO agents with support given by CIRO under the direct supervision of the National Diet then begin covert operations against the White Clad in the Great Tokyo Empire's former territories, with White Clad members being captured in these operations being taken to black sites for processing and interrogation. Seperate teams of JSDF soliders and SOG agents along with SAT teams also begin Grimm [RWBY] and Infernal [Fire Force] extermination work within Japan. The Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], [the Tokkō] also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's combined military forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, [the IJAF] also make a return after the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, with the JSDF being reduced to a defence force. After the restoration of the IJAF in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, special influence is placed on the reconstruction of the Japanese Empire’s ground combat force and the land warfare division of the IJAF, the Imperial Japanese Army as a professional, well-trained army [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJA] living up to the best standards of the pre-Great Cataclysm world. the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The IJAF's elite Japanese special forces/airborne unit, the Teishin Shudan [Raiding Group |Teishin Shudan|], [the Teishin Shudan] is [the Teishin Shudan] also restored [the Teishin Shudan] after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [magnificent lineage |Kazoku|] is [the Kazoku] also restored [the Kazoku] in Japan the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The restoration of the imperial system [the Japanese Empire] in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] heavily influenced [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] by the pre-1868 Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial dynastic constitutional parliamentary monarchy but de facto feudal dynastic hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the heads of the Tokugawa clan being [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] restored [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] to their [the heads of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chiefs of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, |sei-i taishōgun| abbreviated |sei-i taishōgun| and more popularly known as shogun, |sei-i taishōgun| the hereditary military rulers |the sei-i taishōgun| of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868, |the sei-i taishōgun| having civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority]. The restored Tokugawa shoguns have a position more akin to that of the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the Germanic Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors] in days gone past however. The collection of various powers that supported the various shogunates of Japanese history and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the samurai] also make a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Thus, the restored Japanese Empire ruling over post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is formally known as the Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta [the Empire of Great Japan under the Tokugawa Tent Government |Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta|] or simply the Teikoku Bakufu [Imperial Shogunate |Teikoku Bakufu|]. After rebuilding its [Japan's] sociopolitical, military and governmental institutions and [Japan] restructuring itself, post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule seeks to reclaim all of the territories outside of the Japanese Home Islands that were once ruled by the Japanese Empire before 1947: mainly the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule first starts with Korea, which [Korea] is [Korea] in a state of chaos, disarray and confusion after the joint collapse of the Soviet satellite and later on post-Soviet Russia dictatorship of the Korean nationalist, Korean supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist Worker's Party of Korea-ruled totalitarian communist dictatorship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and the unitary presidential republic Republic of Korea occupying South Korea in the wake of the Great Cataclysm. The restored IJAF and buke quickly invades post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea and [The restored IJAF and buke] seize the area [post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea ] with ease, [The restored IJAF and buke during the invasion of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea] putting down Korean bandit and terrorist groups along with crime gangs and anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the ROKAF's strategic-level military command responsible for its [the ROKAF's] special operations forces, its members receiving special training for various unconventional warfare missions and whose primary tasks include guerrilla warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, direct action, collecting information in enemy territory and carrying out special missions including assassination, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command [ROKASWC] along with anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's primary domestic law enforcement agency run under the ROK's Ministry of the Interior and Safety, divided into 18 local police agencies and having local police forces within the ROK under its command, the Korean National Police Agency, the KNPA's specialized Police tactical unit trained to perform dangerous operations whose main mission is counter-terrorism, but it also can include serving high-risk arrest warrants, performing hostage rescue and/or armed intervention, and engaging heavily armed criminals, the SOU [Special Operations Unit] and the ROK's chief intelligence agency and secret police agency, having the responsibility to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the ROK's military along with the additional duties of collecting, coordinating, and distributing information on the ROK's strategy and security, the maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation's classified information, investigation of crimes affecting national security within the ROK, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law, investigation of crimes related to the missions of its staff, along with planning and coordination of information and classified, the National Intelligence Service. The remaining usable elements of the ROKAF and ROKASWC are absorbed into the JSDF and the SOG and the restored IJAF and the TS respectively with the same happening to the KNPA and the SOU with the Japanese NPA and SAT. The remaining usable elements of the NIS are also absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The surviving descendants of the pre-1910 indigenous Korean, slave-owning, sex-slave owning, backward, afraid of progress, Han China worshipping, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility who had immense influence in the post-1392 and pre-1898, Han-Chinese/Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled, backward, out of touch Ming and Qing tributary state of the feudal absolute dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Joeson State/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Joeson Kingdom/Joeson, the yangaban are [the yangaban descendants] suppressed [the yangaban descendants] by the restored IJAF and buke along with anti-Japanese, pro-Korean unification elements in post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The PSIA and CIRO launch a campaign in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea to identify and remove anti-Japanese elements, yangaban descendants and pro-Korean unification elements among the South Korean populace while also running a propaganda campaign that states that the return of Japan to the Korean peninsula after the Great Cataclysm and subsequent collapse of both the ROK and DPRK is a necessary measure for the salvation of the Japanese people. JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands pour into Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea in order to carry out disaster relief work and reconstruction efforts in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The Japanese NPA also starts taking over former KNPA stations and [the Japanese NPA] training new officers in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while also building new stations, with the SAT doing the same. The JSDF takes control of Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea from the restored IJAF and [the JSDF] starts taking over former ROKAF bases and US military bases located in South Korea, and [the JSDF] also begins constructing new bases in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while training and recruiting new servicemen. After the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea, the restored IJAF and buke then assault the former DPRK territory in North Korea from the DMZ border, [the restored IJAF and buke] seizing the former DRPK territory in North Korea with ease due to the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA performing military, political, and psychological operations, to create a \\"second front\\" in the enemy's rear area, and to conduct battlefield and strategic reconnaissance during open war, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ, the DPRK's domestic law enforcement agency in charge of the DPRK's police system along with operating the prison system in the DPRK, monitoring the public distribution system and providing bodyguards to important persons, the Ministry of Social Security, along with the DPRK's paramilitary force subordinate to the ministry which performs various internal security and border security tasks within the DPRK while being in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities, being the DPRK's combined national gendarmerie and civil defense organization organized in military lines, the Social Security Forces [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS, the RGB and the SSF] essentially being [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] unable to [the KPA, KPASOF, the MSS [State and Social] and the RGB] control the DPRK's population after the Great Cataclysm and [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] essentially unable to hold off the Japanese invaders. After the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the restored Japanese Empire takes steps to reintergrate the people of both North and South Korea into Japan. The usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF are [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] absorbed [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] into the restored IJAF, JSDF, SOG and the TS respectively after the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, with the same happening to the MSS [Social] and the Japanese NPA and the SSF and the SAT. The usable elements of the RGB are absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The concentration camps within the DPRK's territory once ran by the Ministry of State Security are dissolved by the restored IJAF and buke and the political prisoners in these concentration camps freed. Like in South Korea, the PSIA and CIRO both run a propaganda campaign while JSDF troops pour into the former DPRK from the Japanese Home Islands, doing disaster relief and reconstruction efforts while putting down Russian loyalists and remnants of the WPK and former DPRK government in South Korea. The JSDF also takes over former KPA bases in the former DPRK and [the JSDF] begins constructing new bases in the former DPRK, [the JSDF] training ethnic North Korean recruits. The Japanese NPA also takes over police stations formerly run by the Ministry of Social Security and begins constructing new ones. After the conquest of both post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK North Korea and post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen as the government [Chōsen] of the entire Korean peninsula. Sometime after the reconquest of Korea and the restoration of Chōsen as its [ post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK and post ROK Korea's] government, the Japanese then turn their [the Japanese's] attention to the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands which they [the Japanese] conquer with ease. The post-1907, pre-1947 Japanese province of Karufuto is [Karufuto] restored [Karufuto] as the government [Karufuto] of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands after their [the Sakhalin's and Kuril Islands's] joint reconquest by the Japanese. After the reconquest of Korea, the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, Japan turns its [Japan's] attention towards Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, which [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] have [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] been [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] in chaos ever since the fall of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China which [Nationalist China] had [Nationalist China] been in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1949 after the latter [the KMT and Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War of 1947-1949 to [the political party and geopolitical entity the KMT and Nationalist China jointly lost the Chinese Civil War to] the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Manchuria, [the collapse of Nationalist China in exile in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1947] as a result of the Great Cataclysm. The Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies/criminal organizations known as the Triads taking up residence in post-Great Cataclysm, post-KMT and Nationalist China Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with the post-Great Cataclysm surviving renmants of the ROCAF's elite special forces unit tasked with carring out special operations, including decaptation strikes in the events of a war, the Airborne Special Service Company, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency which [the Nationalist Chinese NPA] falls under the Nationalist Chinese Ministry of the Interior and [the NPA] oversees all all police forces within National China on a national level, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency's specialist unit and highly trained police tactical unit conducting high-risk arrests and other dangerous law enforcement duties, the Thunder Squad along with Nationalist China's principal intelligence agency created to supervise and coordinate all security-related administrative organizations, military agencies and KMT organizations in Taiwan, gathering, International intelligence, Intelligence within the area of People's Republic of China, Intelligence within the area of Taiwan, Analysis of the nation's strategic intelligence, , Scientific and technological intelligence and telecommunications security, Control and development of secret codes (the matrix) and facilities, Armed Forces Internet Security while also taking charge of planning special tasks and is responsible for guiding, coordinating, and supporting the intelligence affairs in military and civil categories in addition to managing intelligence relevant to national security, the National Security Bureau are no match for the restored IJAF and buke and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] quickly reintergated [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese imperial fold. The usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC are [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] quickly integrated [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] into the restored IJAF and the JSDF along with the restored TS and the SOG with the useable elements of the Nationalist Chinese NPA and Thunder Squad being absorbed into the Japanese NPA and Thunder Squad. The usable elements of the NSB are [the usable elements of the NSB] absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. Like in the Korean peninsula, JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands come down to Taiwan to engage in disaster relief and reconstruction and rebuilding work, while [the JSDF] taking over former US military bases and former ROCAF bases in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and [the JSDF] constructing new bases [in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. After the reconquest of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Japanese take special measures to reintergrate the majority population in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and also the main indigenous group in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands the Taiwan-based sub-branch of the Han Chinese subgroup who speak Hokkien and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo Taiwanese along with the other indigenous groups in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese social, political and economic structure. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the large, powerful villain organization turned secret society and paramilitary underworld group that follows the philosophy that the free usage of Quirks is a basic human right, emphasizing liberation over-regulation [of Quirks], the Inō Kaihō-gun [Meta Liberation

Ruins of ancient splendor lay in stark contrast to the makeshift settlements that had sprung up, a testament to humanity's undying will to survive. It was in this fractured world that the Ōtsutsuki clan found themselves, having traversed from a land forgotten by time and memory. As they stepped into the ruins of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, their arrival was met with a mix of awe and suspicion. Dressed in attire that seemed to blend the archaic with the otherworldly, carrying with them the air of authority and power, they were at once both formidable and enigmatic. The remnants of the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA), Special Assault Teams (SAT), and the Japanese Self Defence Forces (JSDF) watched cautiously, unsure of how to approach these strangers. It was Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, with his imposing stature, who first addressed the assembled crowd, his voice carrying a strange, almost divine quality. \\"We come in peace,\\" he announced, \\"seeking refuge and a new beginning.\\" His words were met with silence, the survivors looking to one another, uncertain. The world they knew had crumbled; myths and legends were all that remained of their once proud culture. Yet here, before them, stood beings that seemed to have stepped right out of those very myths. Among the crowd was Major Akihiro Yamada, a high-ranking official of the JSDF remnants. Intelligent and pragmatic, he understood the potential of aligning with these powerful newcomers. Approaching with a cautious respect, he offered a bow. \\"If true to your words, your presence might be the very boon our people need to rebuild,\\" he said. The Ōtsutsuki accepted the offer of truce, and under their guidance, Kyoto began a slow but steady transformation. Using their advanced technology from Jurai alongside their mysterious powers of chakra, they shared knowledge that spurred innovation and healing. The Kyoto Imperial Palace, once a symbol of the old world, became their new clan compound, a beacon of hope and strength. Their two main DNA anomalies, the Byakugan and the Shikotsumyaku, became legendary. The former allowed them to see through the debris and ruins for salvage and reconstruction; the latter, to manipulate and strengthen structures with an almost alchemical finesse. Under their watch, Kyoto flourished into a haven, its people learning to harness a fraction of the Ōtsutsuki's power. Hiroshi, a young NPA officer, marveled at the transformation. The Ōtsutsuki had taught them the value of their heritage, integrating ancient wisdom with new technologies. In time, he learned to wield a semblance of chakra himself, patrolling the streets with a newfound sense of duty. \\"It's like we're living in an era of legends,\\" he often remarked to his partner, Sato, a former SAT member who had taken up teaching the younger recruits the art of defense using chakra-enhanced techniques. As Kyoto's influence grew, so did its connections. The Ōtsutsuki, through discreet exploration and reconnaissance, extended their reach beyond the city's borders. They learned of the other factions, remnants of a world torn asunder, and saw potential allies in the face of shared adversity. It wasn't long before envoys from the Imperial House of Jurai arrived, curious about the clan's sudden disappearance from their homeland. What they found was a thriving community, a fusion of cultures and technologies that heralded a new age. An alliance was forged, Jurai's vast resources fueling Kyoto's expansion, their combined might a bulwark against the chaos of the post-Great Cataclysm world. In the years that followed, Kyoto's story became one of unity and resurgence, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The Ōtsutsuki, once strangers in a shattered world, were now its guardians, their legacy interwoven with the land they had helped to heal. Their arrival marked a new chapter in human history, an era where magic and technology, tradition and innovation, existed in harmony, lighting the path towards a brighter future."},{"instruction":"give me a ginius and best nitches of sell the tishirt in amazon and etsy for more sells in 2024","output":"To excel in selling t-shirts on Amazon and Etsy in 2024, focusing on unique and trending niches can set you apart from competitors.

Job satisfaction is critical for long-term success and mental well-being. If after your first day of training you're realizing that this job, which involves driving around neighborhoods and cold selling home security systems, isn't aligning with your interests or values, it's reasonable to reconsider if this is the right path for you. Here are a few points to consider: 1. **Career Alignment**: If you're not interested in sales, especially direct, door-to-door sales, this job might continuously feel challenging and unfulfilling. You mentioned you were looking for a job in general and not specifically in sales. It's important to consider what kind of work you see yourself doing or what industry you might be interested in exploring. 2. **Mental and Physical Well-being**: Direct sales jobs can be demanding, both mentally due to the constant need for rejection handling and physically due to the need to drive around and go door-to-door. If you're already feeling hesitant, these aspects could significantly impact your well-being. 3. **Learning and Growth**: While learning to be more social with customers could be a positive aspect, it's essential to weigh if this potential benefit is enough to keep you in a job you're not passionate about. Personal development is important, but you could also develop similar skills in a job that aligns more closely with your interests. 4. **Financial Needs vs. Job Satisfaction**: You mentioned the main draw of this job is the money. Financial needs are real, but they should be balanced with job satisfaction. Long-term, working in a job solely for financial reasons can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction. 5. **Future Opportunities**: Quitting a job early on, especially during training, could be a sign that it's not a good fit. It's better to recognize this sooner rather than later. Employers typically understand that not every job is right for every person, and it's early enough in your tenure that the impact on the company should be minimal. 6. **Next Steps**: Before making any decisions, it might be helpful to think about what you want in a job and start a job search for positions that more closely align with your interests and skills. If you decide to quit, it's professional to communicate your decision respectfully and gratefully for the opportunity. Remember, it's important to be in a job where you feel you can contribute positively and feel fulfilled. While financial reasons for taking a job are valid, considering your mental health and career aspirations is equally important."},{"instruction":"Экскретируемая фракция вещества ЧТО","output":"Экскретируемая фракция вещества (EF - Excretory fraction) – это доля или процент вещества, которая выводится из организма после его фильтрации почками.

Эта фракция может меняться для разных веществ и зависит от множества факторов, таких как состояние функций почек, наличие конкретных переносчиков в почечных трубочках, обратное поглощение и секреция веществ. Примеры: - Для креатинина, который почти полностью фильтруется и не подвергается ни секреции, ни значительному обратному поглощению, экскретируемая фракция приближается к 100%. - Для глюкозы при нормальном уровне глюкозы в крови и при отсутствии сахарного диабета экскретируемая фракция практически равна 0%, так как глюкоза эффективно реабсорбируется в почечных канальцах. Измерение экскретируемой фракции важно для понимания как физиологических процессов в организме, так и для диагностики различных заболеваний, в частности, нарушений функции почек."},{"instruction":"What if Gendry just decided not to die, and didn’t?","output":"Your question seems to tap into a fantasy theme or a hypothetical scenario, especially within the context of a story or narrative where characters might be able to defy traditional outcomes like death through sheer will, magical intervention, or plot armor. If Gendry, a character from \\"Game of Thrones,\\" decided not to die and succeeded, several implications could unfold, depending on the narrative's direction and the logic of the world in which the story is set. \\"Game of Thrones,\\" both the HBO series and the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" novels by George R.R. Martin, is known for its gritty realism within a fantasy setting, where noble intentions or strong wills don't necessarily guarantee survival or victory. However, for the sake of imagination and discussion: 1. **Narrative Impact:** Gendry's continued survival would offer more opportunities for his character to develop, potentially taking on a more significant role within the larger story. This could include becoming a key player in the politics of Westeros or fulfilling a prophecy. 2. **Character Relationships:** It could affect his relationships with other characters, leading to new alliances, romances, or rivalries. For instance, his bond with Arya Stark or his claim to the Baratheon lineage could become more central to the plot. 3. **Influence on Westeros:** As a legitimate or recognized Baratheon, Gendry could stake a claim to Storm's End and become a lord, influencing the balance of power in the Seven Kingdoms, especially after the tumultuous events of the series. 4. **Thematic Implications:** His refusal to die and success in doing so could introduce or reinforce themes of destiny, resilience, or the power of the human will versus the inexorable forces of death and fate that are prevalent in the narrative. 5. **Fantasy Elements Enhanced:** If his survival were attributed to some magical or supernatural means, it could expand the role or understanding of magic within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe, offering new perspectives on life, death, and the natural order. 6. **Fan Reaction:** Depending on how this scenario was executed, it could either be met with enthusiasm from fans happy to see more of a beloved character or skepticism if it seemed to contradict the established tone and rules of the world. In any case, Gendry deciding not to die and achieving that would significantly impact the story and the world of \\"Game of Thrones,\\" opening up intriguing narrative possibilities while potentially challenging the established norms of the story's universe."},{"instruction":"power application process","output":"The power application process involves several steps to apply for power or electricity services for a new residence or business location.

This concept could be implemented for various narrative purposes, such as espionage, infiltration, or to protect the identity of one or both characters. Let's explore a few implications and creative directions this scene could take: # Plot Implications 1. **Deception and Espionage**: Rey could use the holographic disguise to infiltrate a First Order or Sith Eternal base under the guise of Rose, assuming Rose has access that Rey does not. This would add a layer of espionage to the story, showcasing the Resistance's cunning against overwhelming odds. 2. **Character Development and Dynamics**: This scenario could lead to interesting character development, especially in exploring trust and identity themes. It could test the relationship between Rey and Rose, depending on Rose's awareness and consent regarding the disguise. Moreover, it could deepen the audience's understanding of Rey's character, her resourcefulness, and how far she's willing to go to achieve her goals. 3. **Technological Exploration**: Using holographic disguises opens up a realm of technological exploration in the Star Wars universe. It provides a chance to delve into the mechanics and ethics of such technology within this universe, potentially expanding its lore. # Execution in the Story - **Setup**: Establish early on that the Resistance has developed or acquired technology that allows for realistic holographic disguises. This can be introduced through a subplot or minor character's story arc to avoid it feeling like a deus ex machina when Rey uses it. - **Dramatic Irony**: Utilize the audience’s knowledge of Rey's disguise to create tension. Scenes where Rey, as Rose, interacts with characters who are unaware of her true identity (like Kylo Ren or other First Order members) would be rich with dramatic irony. - **Reveal and Consequences**: Carefully plan the reveal of Rey's disguise, both to characters within the story and the audience (if it hasn't been made clear). The consequences of her actions, depending on their success or failure, could drive the plot forward and affect her relationship with other characters, especially Rose. # Considerations - **Character Consistency**: Ensure that Rey's decision to use a holographic disguise aligns with her character's morals, abilities, and the story's established rules. - **Rose’s Role**: Consider how this plot device affects Rose’s character. It shouldn't diminish her role or agency within the story. Instead, it could provide a way to explore her character further, perhaps by highlighting her own contributions to the Resistance or her reaction to Rey's actions. - **Audience Perception**: Gauge how the audience might perceive this twist. It should add depth to the narrative and characters, not serve as a mere plot gimmick. While such a scene is speculative and not part of the current Star Wars canon, it presents a fascinating \\"what if\\" scenario that could enrich the storytelling by incorporating themes of identity, sacrifice, and the complexities of warfare strategies within the Star Wars universe."},{"instruction":"Write a World of Quest/Skunk Fu crossover where Lord Spite destroys several universes, such as Kikoriki, Will & Dewitt, BFDI, Squish, Our heroes try to stop him but are sent into the Skunk Fu universe where they have to team up to stop Spite, who is teaming up with Dragon","output":"Title: **The Quest to Save the Multiverse** --- In a realm where dimensions intertwine, and universes collide, a cataclysmic event is set in motion by the infamous Lord Spite. His thirst for power and dominion knows no bounds, as he discovers the means to obliterate entire worlds. One by one, realms such as Kikoriki, Will & Dewitt, and the lands of BFDI and Squish fall before his might, leaving nothing but void in their wake. Heroes from these worlds, powerless to stop the annihilation, find themselves facing the ultimate defeat. Amidst the chaos, a mysterious force propels our heroes into a universe untouched by Spite's wrath — the world of Skunk Fu. Dazed but determined, they encounter Skunk, an enthusiastic young martial artist, and his unconventional band of warriors. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the wise and venerable Panda explains the dire consequences should Lord Spite succeed in his quest for ultimate power. Together, they form an unlikely alliance. The lore of Skunk Fu tells of an ancient artifact, the Jade Lotus, capable of restoring balance to the realms. But there's a catch — to retrieve the Lotus, they must journey across treacherous lands, facing challenges that test their strength, wisdom, and courage. Meanwhile, in a shocking twist of fate, Lord Spite and the malevolent Dragon of the Skunk Fu universe forge an alliance, pooling their dark resources to overpower any who stand in their way. The convergence of such formidable foes requires our heroes to push beyond their limits, forging friendships and honing their skills in ways they never thought possible. Quest, the fearless leader from the World of Quest, alongside his eclectic team, brings strategic might and unrivaled bravery to the group. Skunk, with his unyielding optimism and martial arts prowess, inspires hope amidst despair. Together, with the heroes from the other universes, they embody the last stand against chaos. As the journey unfolds, each hero discovers inner strengths and abilities, unlocked by the deep bonds of friendship and the collective will to preserve the tapestry of the multiverse. From the silent resilience of Dewitt to the unwavering courage of Skunk, every hero plays a pivotal role in navigating the challenges that lie ahead. The climax arrives at the Fortress of Shadows, where Spite and Dragon await, surrounded by the swirling energies of the destroyed universes. An epic battle ensues, where martial arts blend with mystical powers, and the heart of every world hangs in the balance. In a moment of unity, the heroes channel their energies through the Jade Lotus, igniting a light that pushes back the darkness. With a deafening roar, the combined forces of good prevail, shattering the alliance of evil and restoring the shattered universes to their rightful state. The victory is bittersweet, as our heroes realize the fragility of their worlds and the strength found in unity. In the aftermath, the boundaries between the universes begin to mend, and it's time for everyone to return to their respective homes. Farewells are exchanged, promises made to remember the bonds forged in the heat of battle, and the knowledge that in the darkest times, unity and courage can carve a path to the light. As each hero steps through the portals to their worlds, a new chapter awaits, with the assurance that should darkness rise again, they will not face it alone. The alliance of the World of Quest and Skunk Fu, enriched by the heroes of universes far and wide, stands as a beacon of hope — a testament to the power of friendship, courage, and the enduring quest for peace across the multiverse."},{"instruction":"Write the story when the WOQ heroes learn about the nefarious plot, Prince Nestor initially shrugs it off saying \\"We need to focus on the Shattered Soul Sword\\"","output":"**Chapter 1: The Unfolding Darkness** In the vibrant heart of the Kingdom of Odyssia, where adventure and danger walk hand-in-hand, the Quest Team had gathered in the royal library, their eyes set on ancient maps and dusty tomes. They were on the cusp of uncovering the final clues to the whereabouts of the Shattered Soul Sword, an artifact of immense power said to be the key to securing the kingdom’s future. Prince Nestor, ever the focused leader, was bent over a particularly old scroll, his brow furrowed in concentration. It was amidst this intensive research that a frenzied messenger burst through the library doors. Gasping for breath, the messenger relayed a tale so daring and dark, it threatened to swallow the light of all hope in the room. He spoke of Lord Spite, a name that sent shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned adventurers, and a plot so nefarious, it was almost beyond belief. Entire universes, he claimed, had begun to blink out of existence, consumed by Spite's insatiable hunger for power. The team exchanged uneasy glances, the gravity of the situation settling in like a heavy fog. All except for Prince Nestor, who, with a determined shake of his head, refocused on his map. “We need to focus on the Shattered Soul Sword,” he said, his voice unwavering. “Without it, Odyssia is vulnerable. This…destruction of universes might well be a distraction, a tale too fantastical to divert us from our true quest.\\" Way, the warrior of few words but great wisdom, stepped forward. “And if it isn’t?” he posed, the weight of his concern evident in his voice. “If universes are indeed disappearing, how long before ours faces the same fate?” The question hung in the air, a specter that none could ignore. It was then that Quest, the battle-hardened hero, known for his pragmatism, spoke. “If this threat is real, turning a blind eye could mean the end of everything we fight for. Perhaps, it’s time we investigate this anomaly.” Graer, the once mighty Gryphon, and now comedic relief of the group, nervously chuckled. “Investigate? How do we even begin chasing a shadow that devours entire worlds?” The answer came from an unexpected source. Anna Maht, the young wizard with a connection to the mystical, stepped into the light. Her eyes glowed with a profound strength as she deciphered a hidden message within the ancient texts. “There is a way,” she revealed, her voice a melodic whisper that demanded attention. “A portal, hidden within the Everdark Forest, said to connect the farthest reaches of the multiverse. If Spite is behind this, we will find our answers there.” Against Nestor's better judgment, the decision was made. The Quest Team would venture into the unknown, seeking out the portal in the hopes of confronting this unprecedented threat. The urgency of their original quest for the Shattered Soul Sword lingered in the back of their minds, but the potential annihilation of not just their world, but countless others, could not be ignored. **Chapter 2: Into the Everdark** The Everdark Forest lived up to its name, with thick canopies that swallowed daylight whole and air that seemed to whisper with ancient secrets. Guided by Anna’s unwavering spirit and Quest’s tactical brilliance, they navigated the perilous terrain, confronting creatures and challenges that tested their resolve like never before. It was deep within the heart of this darkness that they found it — a shimmering portal, pulsing with energy, its destination unknown. With a shared look of determination, the Quest Team stepped through, leaving behind the familiar for a fate uncertain. **Chapter 3: A New Alliance** They emerged in a world unfamiliar, yet facing a crisis all too recognizable. Before them stood Skunk, a warrior of heart, and his friends, embroiled in their battle against the tyranny of Dragon. The stories of universes fading into nothingness had reached them too, and in Spite’s pursuit of ultimate power, they found a common enemy. After initial distrust and challenges that pitted them against one another, the realization dawned on both groups — they were now allies in a fight greater than any they had faced. United by their shared purpose, they now turned their attention to the looming shadow of Spite and his unexpected ally, Dragon. **Chapter 4: The Battle Beyond** Joined by the wisdom of Panda, the strength of Quest, and the courage of Skunk, the newly formed alliance devised a plan. They would confront Spite and Dragon at the source of their power, leveraging the combined might of their worlds and the unforeseen power of unity. The battle that unfolded was epic, a clash of wills and worlds, where every strike was fueled by the resolve to protect not just their own universe but the fabric of the multiverse. In the heart of danger, Nestor found his resolve, swinging his sword not for the glory of Odyssia, but for the future of all realms. In a defining moment, fueled by the collective hopes of countless worlds, the Jade Lotus was unleashed. Its light, pure and unwavering, pierced the darkness, severing the bond between Spite and Dragon, and restoring the consumed universes to their rightful state. **Chapter 5: Homeward Bound** In the aftermath of the battle, amidst the relief of victory and the sorrow of parting, the alliance shared a quiet moment. They had traversed the boundaries of their worlds, fought side by side, and emerged victorious. The lessons learned and the friendships forged would linger long after their goodbyes. Prince Nestor, his gaze set on the horizon of his own world, knew that the quest for the Shattered Soul Sword awaited. But with a newfound perspective, he acknowledged the infinite threads that bound their worlds together, each quest intertwined with the next in the tapestry of the multiverse. With a final exchange of farewells, the teams parted ways, stepping through portals to their respective realms, carrying with them the promise of support, should darkness ever rise again. For in the hearts of heroes, hope endures, ready to leap across worlds in defense of all that is good. And though the Quest Team returned to the trails of Odyssia, their journey had taught them an invaluable lesson — that sometimes, the greatest strength lies in unity, and that no quest, no matter how daunting, is ever truly faced alone."},{"instruction":"is this a legit concern?..quitting sales job after one day because I don’t want to drive around neighborhoods knocking on doors to sell home security systems to people?

From your description, it seems like several factors are influencing your thoughts on leaving the job: 1. **Job Nature:** The job involves door-to-door sales, which can be challenging and is not suited to everyone's preferences or skill sets. It requires a lot of self-motivation, resilience to frequent rejections, comfort with direct sales tactics, and extensive travel within neighborhoods. 2. **Personal Interest:** You've stated that you weren't interested in sales to begin with and only took the job out of a general need for employment. If your heart isn't in it, you might find the job draining rather than fulfilling or rewarding. It's crucial for your long-term professional development to find work that aligns better with your interests or career goals. 3. **Social Skills Development:** While you acknowledge the potential benefits of enhancing your social skills, it's worth considering whether this particular environment is the best and only way to achieve that growth. There might be other roles that offer a more comfortable or appealing context for developing these skills. 4. **Financial Considerations:** The main appeal of the job, as you've identified, is the potential earnings. Sales roles often offer the chance to earn significant commissions on top of a base salary. However, if the work makes you miserable, it may not be worth the financial rewards. It's essential to weigh the value of potential earnings against your job satisfaction and mental health. 5. **Employer Response:** Many employers understand that job fit is crucial and that not every job is right for every person, especially in high-turnover industries like sales. If you approach the situation professionally and explain your reasons honestly, they are likely to understand. It's better for both parties to recognize a misfit early on rather than after investing more time and resources into training. **Should You Quit?** Based on your description, if you are certain this job won't make you happy or offer the kind of professional development you're seeking, it might be best to quit sooner rather than later. Here are a few steps you can take: - Reflect thoroughly on your decision. Make sure you're not making a snap judgment based on initial impressions alone. - Consider speaking with your manager or HR representative about your concerns. There might be other opportunities within the company that align more closely with your interests or skills. - Start looking for other jobs that may be more in line with your career goals or personal interests. - When you decide to quit, do so professionally. Offer a resignation letter, thanking the employer for the opportunity and explaining that the role is not a good fit for you personally. Remember, it's vital to find a job that not only pays the bills but also contributes to your overall career trajectory and personal growth. If this job isn't the right fit, there's likely something better out there that is."},{"instruction":"is this a legit concern?..quitting sales job after one day because I don’t want to drive around neighborhoods knocking on doors to sell home security systems to people?

The job you described entails door-to-door sales, which requires a specific set of skills and comfort level, including strong interpersonal skills, resilience in the face of rejection, and the physicality of moving around neighborhoods. It's not for everyone. Here are some points to consider when making your decision: 1. **Your interests and career goals:** It sounds like sales, particularly door-to-door sales, is not something you're interested in. It's important to consider whether this job aligns with your long-term career aspirations or if it might detract from them. While all jobs can provide valuable experience, making sure they align at least somewhat with your interests or goals is important. 2. **Learning opportunities vs. personal comfort:** While you mention the potential to become more social and learn customer service skills, it's also important to weigh these benefits against your comfort level with the job's requirements. If the idea of driving around and soliciting business door-to-door makes you uncomfortable or unhappy, the potential learning opportunities may not outweigh the negatives. 3. **Financial needs vs. job satisfaction:** You mentioned the main draw of this job is the money. It's essential to balance financial needs with job satisfaction. If you dread going to work every day, it can take a toll on your mental health and overall well-being, regardless of the paycheck. 4. **Employer's reaction:** Regarding your concern about the employer's reaction, it's always better to be upfront and honest as soon as possible. Employers generally prefer to know sooner rather than later if a new hire is not planning to stay, as it allows them to minimize training expenses and start looking for a replacement sooner. 5. **Exploring other options:** If you decide to quit, consider what other job opportunities might be a better fit. Reflect on what aspects of a job would make you feel more fulfilled or interested. It might also be worth considering part-time work, internships, or volunteer opportunities that align more closely with your interests and can provide valuable experience. Ultimately, the decision to quit is yours and should be based on your level of comfort, financial needs, and career goals. If after careful consideration, you feel this job is not the right fit, it's okay to quit, especially early in the training phase. It’s important to find a balance between financial necessities and personal well-being."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the RWBY web series, manga, anime and literature franchise, the Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku [Academy Battle City Asterisk/The Asterisk War: The Academy City on the Water |Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku|] light novel, manga, video game and anime franchise, the Deathlands book and TV movie franchise, the Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō [Magika Swordsman and Summoner |Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō|] light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise,t he Dragon Ball manga and anime franchise and its [Dragon Ball's] sequel series, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Z's epilogue series, Dragon Ball GT, the Tenchi Muyo!

Teikoku's] subsequent establishment and [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's] growth into the Galaxy's hyperpower [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's current state] starting [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's rise to power and dominance |the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku| of the Milky Way] in the earlier stages of the latter's [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] fall and [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] eventual subsquent dissolution. The Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium has its [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] canon civilian and military technologies with the Star Wars humans having the same psychic and magical powers and hyper-intelligence as the Primoris prognatus in canon Halo in addition to the Primoris prognatus' canon civilian and military technologies and the same being true for the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku and the Covenant. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also replaces the galaxy-spanning paramilitary force/meritocratic military organization/pirate guild lead by the infamous race of horned extraterrestrial warmongers known as the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z], the Planetary Trade Organization [Dragon Ball Z] in this fic, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku in this fic] also having the PTO's technology, weapons and equipment, with the Juraians [Tenchi Muyo], a humanoid extraterrestrial race [the Jurians] of psychics and magic users good at electronics and mechanics [the Jurians], who [the Juraians] are the ruling caste and the dominant force in the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's politics, royalty and aristocracy [the Juraians] replacing the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z] and [the Jurians] also having the Frost Demons' swordsmanships and qi/ki manipulation abilities in addition to their [the Juraians'] own canonical abilities and skills, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku replacing the PTO and the Jurians replacing the Frost Demons in this fic] thus making them [the Juraians in this story] the masters [the Juraians in this story] of the naturally aggressive warrior race descended from Great Apes who gained intelligence and took on a humanoid form who, since ancient times, have lived a violent and inhumane lifestyle, where they attack numerous planets to build up wealth and goods, the Saiyans [Dragon Ball Z], [the Juraians being the masters of the Saiyans in this fic] and [the Juraians in this fic] using the Saiyans to conquer and clean out multiple planets not just across the Milky Way, but across the various galaxies for them [the Juraians in this fic]. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also maintains control of the Jikū Kanri Kyoku [Time-Space Administrative Bureau |Jikū Kanri Kyoku|], an interdimensional security force [Jikū Kanri Kyoku] and full-out military force [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] formed [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] jointly by a union of several worlds that [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] also monitors cultural growth and provides disaster relief to each world under the JKK's jurisdiction especially when it involves magic and the magical items of tremendous power that are legacies of collapsed civilizations known as Lost Logia [Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha] , [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] from Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha in this story. The descendant of low-class warrior Saiyans imprinted with only enough training to fight and conquer, Kakkarot [Dragon Ball franchise] is [Kakkarot] still [Kakkarot] sent to Earth to [Kakkarot] conquer it [Earth] sometime in the 500 AD period of human history as a baby, [Kakkarot] being [Kakkarot] adopted by Grandpa Gohan [Dragon Ball] after his [Kakkarot's] spaceship crashlanded on a hyperadvanced, semi-spacefaring version of ancient Earth, more specifically in the Han Chinese Imperial House of Yang-ruled Great Sui State/Sui dynasty ruling over Han China and [Kakkarot] being given the Chinese name of 'Sun Wukong' by Grandpa Gohan. After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs [Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z] and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled absolute imperial dynastic monarchy of the Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 21th century via [Wukong] taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, [Trunks's descendants] subsequently being absorbed into the Japanese as the centuries go on. Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire is [the Japanese Empire in this fic] restored [the Japanese Empire in this fanfic] as the government [the Japanese Empire] of Japan after the series of natural disasters, continent-wide wars and nuclear exchanges resulting in flames exploding around the world, devastating it [Earth] and leaving most parts of the planet uninhabitable, with continents being torn apart and some nations being utterly obliterated known as the Great Cataclysm [Fire Force], which [the Great Cataclysm in this story] is [the Great Cataclysm in this story] the same even as the global intercontinental military conflict and power bloc war within the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe that lasted from 2045 to 2064 and started as a result of a military conflict between the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled unitary presidential republic of the Russian Federation ruling over Siberia and the Russian Far East from Russia and the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Greater Manchuria over immigration due to global cooling starting around 2030 which was already worsened by advanced agricultural production becoming a solar-powered industry in 2020, leading to a temporary population boom [the conflict which lasted from 2045 to 2064 in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe] known as the Third World War [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] and the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], [the Third World War in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe being the same as the Great Cataclysm from Fire Force and the Invertia from Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku in this story] with the

the Ōtsutsuki clan] acting as this neo-Japanese Empire's imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] fleeing [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] from the hidden-from the rest of the world, mythical, stuck on the feudal era of Japanese and the Ming and Song dynasty era of Chinese history politically, socially and economically, having the mythical combination of ki/qi and spiritual energy known as chakra-using fake shinobi and wuxia style cultivator mega continent known as the Elemental Nations [Naruto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] setting in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] being [what happened to the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] mistaken for [what the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic were |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| mistaken |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| for] the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, the real-life Japanese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato] by [who mistook the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the Imperial House of Great Yamato] the residents of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, this mistake [the residents of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto mistaking the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the surviving remnants of Imperial House of Great Yamato left in post-Great Cataclysm Japan] allowing it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] to [the Ōtsutsuki clan this fanfic] rebuild its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's in this fanfic's] new home [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] use it [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] as a base [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] for the eventual annhilation, conquest, absorption and assmilation of the myriad warlord states, bandit hideouts and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm, [the assimilation of the myriad of warlord states, bandit fiefdoms and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm by the fortified, rebuilt, restructured and rejuvinated post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] ending with the conquest and subsequent assmilation of the de-jure constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy but de facto theocratic industrial theocratic city state of the Raffles-dynasty ruled Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in post-Great Cataclysm Tokyo into the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule, which [the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] marked the reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule and the end of the post-Great Cataclysm warlord era in Japan. The creatures of Grimm [human and supernatural eating carnivorous monsters |Grimm| that |Grimm| do not |what the Grimm do not have| possess a soul, |the Grimm| being |what happens to the Grimm| drawn towards |what attracts the Grimms’ presence| negative emotions such as jealously, grief, loneliness, hatred and fear, |the Grimms’ attraction to negativity| causing them |the Grimms| to often congregate on the source of these emotions, |the Grimm| attacking any humans and supernatural creatures they |the Grimm| encounter on sight, |the Grimm| from |the media franchise the Grimm are (the Grimm) from| RWBY] also emerge after the Great Cataclysm all over the world along with the Infernals [former humans that spontaneous combust and |the Infernals| become |what the Infernals become after spontaneous combustion| misshapen fiery charcoal-like monsters, the Infernals being |what the Infernals are| a common feature and |the Infernals| a ever-present threat |the Infernals| in the post-Great Catalclysm world, |the Infernals| being |the Infernals| from |the franchise the Infernals are (the Infernals) from Fire Force] and the Gastrea [deadly parasites |Gastrea| that |Gastrea| transform |who Gastrea transform| their |the Gastrea’s| victims into |what the Gastrea transform their (the Gastrea’s victims) into mutated, superhuman, human-eating, powerful monsters (the endstage of a Gastrea infection), |the Gastrea| from |the media franchise the Gastrea are (the Gastrea) from| Black Bullet] Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. The reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule allows for the quick reconstruction and rebuilding of the country [Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule] and pre-Great Cataclysm luxuries such as electricity, bullet trains, the internet and running water soon return to Japan due to the merger of the Great Tokyo Empire's steampunk and dieselpunk technology with the advanced extraterrestrial technology and industry from brought from Jurai and the surviving pre- Great Cataclysm Japanese, American and even Russian technology left behind. In fact, the seizure of the unimaginably powerful flame or energy that be used to bring both creation and destruction, not connected to the physical laws of Earth but connected to collective minds, emotions, and perceptions of humanity known as the Adolla Burst [Fire Force]-powered infinite energy providing thermal-powered generator located in the Central Ward of the Tokyo Empire, the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" [Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \\"Amaterasu\\" |Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"|] from [the media franchise the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" is |the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"| from] Fire Force, [the seizure of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] during the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule is what will prove useful in the stability of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire. The Ōtsutsuki soon discover the presence of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, very manipulative, volatile and misanthropic nature Adolla Burst having survivor of the Great Cataclysm known only as Amaterasu [Fire Force] inside the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" after the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule and [the Ōtsutsuki] quickly rescue Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\", [ The Ōtsutsuki rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] copying her [Amaterasu's] Adolla Burst and placing the copy [of Amaterasu's Adolla Burst] inside the the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" to power it [ the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] while [The Ōtsutsuki after |The Ōtsutsuki| rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] scanning her [Amaterasu's] memories and [The Ōtsutsuki] discovering the presence of the extraterrestrial god-like entity with immense reality warping powers known only as the Evangelist [Fire Force] and its [the Evangelist's] cult organization with the goal of recreating the Great Cataclysm, the White Clad [Fire Force] within the Great Tokyo Empire's territories. The Ōtsutsuki soon begin constructions of replicas of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" all through post-Great Cataclysm Japan. Japan's Bicameral national legislature with the ability to pass laws and also to nominate the Japanese prime minister, consisting of a lower house, called the House of Representatives and an upper house, the House of Councillors, which [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] are [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] directly elected under a parallel voting system, the National Diet, [the National Diet] also resumes operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. In fact the bill that restores the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is passed through the National Diet. Japan’s central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system responsible for supervising Japan’s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters, under the Japanese Cabinet Office commission responsible for guaranteeing the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration, the National Public Safety Commission of the Japanese Cabinet Office, the Japanese National Police Agency, the elite tactical unit equivalent to the US Delta Force/US CIA SOG black ops death squads of the Japanese police force maintained by individual Japanese prefectural police forces and supervised by the Japanese National Police Agency and also national-level counterterrorism unit that cooperates with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads, the Special Assault Team, post-WW2's Japan's domestic intelligence agency administered by the Japanese Ministry of Justice tasked with internal security and espionage against threats to Japanese national security, contributing to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations, the Public Security Intelligence Agency and the post-WW2 Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet, reporting directly to the Japanese Prime Minister, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, [the Japanese NPA, the SAT, PISA and CIRO] soon resume their [the Japanese NPA's, the SAT's, PISA's and CIRO's] respective operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] along with the JSDF's special forces unit with a mission of infiltration into enemy territory, reconnaissance, sabotage, and hostage rescue, and conducting military operations against guerrillas or enemy commandos during wartime, the Special Forces Group, [the JSDF and SFG] also return to full operational capacity after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. SOG and SAT teams accompanied by PIRO agents with support given by CIRO under the direct supervision of the National Diet then begin covert operations against the White Clad in the Great Tokyo Empire's former territories, with White Clad members being captured in these operations being taken to black sites for processing and interrogation. Seperate teams of JSDF soliders and SOG agents along with SAT teams also begin Grimm [RWBY] and Infernal [Fire Force] extermination work within Japan. The Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], [the Tokkō] also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's combined military forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, [the IJAF] also make a return after the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, with the JSDF being reduced to a defence force. After the restoration of the IJAF in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, special influence is placed on the reconstruction of the Japanese Empire’s ground combat force and the land warfare division of the IJAF, the Imperial Japanese Army as a professional, well-trained army [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJA] living up to the best standards of the pre-Great Cataclysm world. the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The IJAF's elite Japanese special forces/airborne unit, the Teishin Shudan [Raiding Group |Teishin Shudan|], [the Teishin Shudan] is [the Teishin Shudan] also restored [the Teishin Shudan] after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [magnificent lineage |Kazoku|] is [the Kazoku] also restored [the Kazoku] in Japan the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The restoration of the imperial system [the Japanese Empire] in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] heavily influenced [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] by the pre-1868 Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial dynastic constitutional parliamentary monarchy but de facto feudal dynastic hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the heads of the Tokugawa clan being [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] restored [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] to their [the heads of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chiefs of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, |sei-i taishōgun| abbreviated |sei-i taishōgun| and more popularly known as shogun, |sei-i taishōgun| the hereditary military rulers |the sei-i taishōgun| of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868, |the sei-i taishōgun| having civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority]. The restored Tokugawa shoguns have a position more akin to that of the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the Germanic Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors] in days gone past however. The collection of various powers that supported the various shogunates of Japanese history and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the samurai] also make a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Thus, the restored Japanese Empire ruling over post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is formally known as the Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta [the Empire of Great Japan under the Tokugawa Tent Government |Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta|] or simply the Teikoku Bakufu [Imperial Shogunate |Teikoku Bakufu|]. After rebuilding its [Japan's] sociopolitical, military and governmental institutions and [Japan] restructuring itself, post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule seeks to reclaim all of the territories outside of the Japanese Home Islands that were once ruled by the Japanese Empire before 1947: mainly the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule first starts with Korea, which [Korea] is [Korea] in a state of chaos, disarray and confusion after the joint collapse of the Soviet satellite and later on post-Soviet Russia dictatorship of the Korean nationalist, Korean supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist Worker's Party of Korea-ruled totalitarian communist dictatorship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and the unitary presidential republic Republic of Korea occupying South Korea in the wake of the Great Cataclysm. The restored IJAF and buke quickly invades post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea and [The restored IJAF and buke] seize the area [post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea ] with ease, [The restored IJAF and buke during the invasion of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea] putting down Korean bandit and terrorist groups along with crime gangs and anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the ROKAF's strategic-level military command responsible for its [the ROKAF's] special operations forces, its members receiving special training for various unconventional warfare missions and whose primary tasks include guerrilla warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, direct action, collecting information in enemy territory and carrying out special missions including assassination, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command [ROKASWC] along with anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's primary domestic law enforcement agency run under the ROK's Ministry of the Interior and Safety, divided into 18 local police agencies and having local police forces within the ROK under its command, the Korean National Police Agency, the KNPA's specialized Police tactical unit trained to perform dangerous operations whose main mission is counter-terrorism, but it also can include serving high-risk arrest warrants, performing hostage rescue and/or armed intervention, and engaging heavily armed criminals, the SOU [Special Operations Unit] and the ROK's chief intelligence agency and secret police agency, having the responsibility to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the ROK's military along with the additional duties of collecting, coordinating, and distributing information on the ROK's strategy and security, the maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation's classified information, investigation of crimes affecting national security within the ROK, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law, investigation of crimes related to the missions of its staff, along with planning and coordination of information and classified, the National Intelligence Service. The remaining usable elements of the ROKAF and ROKASWC are absorbed into the JSDF and the SOG and the restored IJAF and the TS respectively with the same happening to the KNPA and the SOU with the Japanese NPA and SAT. The remaining usable elements of the NIS are also absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The surviving descendants of the pre-1910 indigenous Korean, slave-owning, sex-slave owning, backward, afraid of progress, Han China worshipping, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility who had immense influence in the post-1392 and pre-1898, Han-Chinese/Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled, backward, out of touch Ming and Qing tributary state of the feudal absolute dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Joeson State/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Joeson Kingdom/Joeson, the yangaban are [the yangaban descendants] suppressed [the yangaban descendants] by the restored IJAF and buke along with anti-Japanese, pro-Korean unification elements in post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The PSIA and CIRO launch a campaign in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea to identify and remove anti-Japanese elements, yangaban descendants and pro-Korean unification elements among the South Korean populace while also running a propaganda campaign that states that the return of Japan to the Korean peninsula after the Great Cataclysm and subsequent collapse of both the ROK and DPRK is a necessary measure for the salvation of the Japanese people. JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands pour into Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea in order to carry out disaster relief work and reconstruction efforts in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The Japanese NPA also starts taking over former KNPA stations and [the Japanese NPA] training new officers in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while also building new stations, with the SAT doing the same. The JSDF takes control of Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea from the restored IJAF and [the JSDF] starts taking over former ROKAF bases and US military bases located in South Korea, and [the JSDF] also begins constructing new bases in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while training and recruiting new servicemen. After the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea, the restored IJAF and buke then assault the former DPRK territory in North Korea from the DMZ border, [the restored IJAF and buke] seizing the former DRPK territory in North Korea with ease due to the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA performing military, political, and psychological operations, to create a \\"second front\\" in the enemy's rear area, and to conduct battlefield and strategic reconnaissance during open war, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ, the DPRK's domestic law enforcement agency in charge of the DPRK's police system along with operating the prison system in the DPRK, monitoring the public distribution system and providing bodyguards to important persons, the Ministry of Social Security, along with the DPRK's paramilitary force subordinate to the ministry which performs various internal security and border security tasks within the DPRK while being in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities, being the DPRK's combined national gendarmerie and civil defense organization organized in military lines, the Social Security Forces [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS, the RGB and the SSF] essentially being [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] unable to [the KPA, KPASOF, the MSS [State and Social] and the RGB] control the DPRK's population after the Great Cataclysm and [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] essentially unable to hold off the Japanese invaders. After the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the restored Japanese Empire takes steps to reintergrate the people of both North and South Korea into Japan. The usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF are [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] absorbed [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] into the restored IJAF, JSDF, SOG and the TS respectively after the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, with the same happening to the MSS [Social] and the Japanese NPA and the SSF and the SAT. The usable elements of the RGB are absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The concentration camps within the DPRK's territory once ran by the Ministry of State Security are dissolved by the restored IJAF and buke and the political prisoners in these concentration camps freed. Like in South Korea, the PSIA and CIRO both run a propaganda campaign while JSDF troops pour into the former DPRK from the Japanese Home Islands, doing disaster relief and reconstruction efforts while putting down Russian loyalists and remnants of the WPK and former DPRK government in South Korea. The JSDF also takes over former KPA bases in the former DPRK and [the JSDF] begins constructing new bases in the former DPRK, [the JSDF] training ethnic North Korean recruits. The Japanese NPA also takes over police stations formerly run by the Ministry of Social Security and begins constructing new ones. After the conquest of both post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK North Korea and post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen as the government [Chōsen] of the entire Korean peninsula. Sometime after the reconquest of Korea and the restoration of Chōsen as its [ post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK and post ROK Korea's] government, the Japanese then turn their [the Japanese's] attention to the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands which they [the Japanese] conquer with ease. The post-1907, pre-1947 Japanese province of Karufuto is [Karufuto] restored [Karufuto] as the government [Karufuto] of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands after their [the Sakhalin's and Kuril Islands's] joint reconquest by the Japanese. After the reconquest of Korea, the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, Japan turns its [Japan's] attention towards Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, which [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] have [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] been [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] in chaos ever since the fall of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China which [Nationalist China] had [Nationalist China] been in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1949 after the latter [the KMT and Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War of 1947-1949 to [the political party and geopolitical entity the KMT and Nationalist China jointly lost the Chinese Civil War to] the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Manchuria, [the collapse of Nationalist China in exile in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1947] as a result of the Great Cataclysm. The Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies/criminal organizations known as the Triads taking up residence in post-Great Cataclysm, post-KMT and Nationalist China Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with the post-Great Cataclysm surviving renmants of the ROCAF's elite special forces unit tasked with carring out special operations, including decaptation strikes in the events of a war, the Airborne Special Service Company, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency which [the Nationalist Chinese NPA] falls under the Nationalist Chinese Ministry of the Interior and [the NPA] oversees all all police forces within National China on a national level, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency's specialist unit and highly trained police tactical unit conducting high-risk arrests and other dangerous law enforcement duties, the Thunder Squad along with Nationalist China's principal intelligence agency created to supervise and coordinate all security-related administrative organizations, military agencies and KMT organizations in Taiwan, gathering, International intelligence, Intelligence within the area of People's Republic of China, Intelligence within the area of Taiwan, Analysis of the nation's strategic intelligence, , Scientific and technological intelligence and telecommunications security, Control and development of secret codes (the matrix) and facilities, Armed Forces Internet Security while also taking charge of planning special tasks and is responsible for guiding, coordinating, and supporting the intelligence affairs in military and civil categories in addition to managing intelligence relevant to national security, the National Security Bureau are no match for the restored IJAF and buke and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] quickly reintergated [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese imperial fold. The usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC are [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] quickly integrated [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] into the restored IJAF and the JSDF along with the restored TS and the SOG with the useable elements of the Nationalist Chinese NPA and Thunder Squad being absorbed into the Japanese NPA and Thunder Squad. The usable elements of the NSB are [the usable elements of the NSB] absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. Like in the Korean peninsula, JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands come down to Taiwan to engage in disaster relief and reconstruction and rebuilding work, while [the JSDF] taking over former US military bases and former ROCAF bases in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and [the JSDF] constructing new bases [in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. After the reconquest of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Japanese take special measures to reintergrate the majority population in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and also the main indigenous group in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands the Taiwan-based sub-branch of the Han Chinese subgroup who speak Hokkien and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo Taiwanese along with the other indigenous groups in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese social, political and economic structure. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the large, powerful villain organization turned secret society and paramilitary underworld group that follows the philosophy that the free usage of Quirks is a basic human right, emphasizing liberation over-regulation [of Quirks], the Inō Kaihō-gun [Meta Liberation

Given the intricate setup, this exposition aims to shed light on the critical points of divergence, primarily the arrival of the Ōtsutsuki clan in post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto and their ensuing influence on the formation of a new empire. --- In the aftermath of the Great Cataclysm, the world lay in ruins, its once bustling civilizations brought low by unprecedented disasters. Amongst this chaos, a mysterious clan emerged from the shadows of history, their origins steeped in legend and power. They were known as the Ōtsutsuki, beings of immense strength and enigmatic purpose. Their arrival in the devastated lands of what was once Kyoto marked the beginning of a new era. \\"Behold, the remnants of a world that once thrived,\\" Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, the matriarch of the clan, spoke as they overlooked the city from a distant hill. Her eyes, imbued with the Byakugan, saw not just the destruction but the potential for rebirth. Her son, Momoshiki, turned to her, his gaze piercing through the veil of reality, \\"This world possesses rich natural energy, ripe for our cultivation. But first, we must establish our dominion.\\" They descended upon Kyoto, their arrival shrouded in mystery. The local survivors, desperate for a semblance of order amidst the chaos, witnessed the Ōtsutsuki's supernatural abilities. Word spread quickly of these god-like beings, and rumors conflated their identity with the long-lost Imperial House of Great Yamato. One evening, within the makeshift council that had formed amongst the remnants of the city's governance, a debate raged about the nature of their new 'benefactors.' \\"I tell you, these are no ordinary survivors. They command powers that defy explanation,\\" a former member of the JSDF insisted, his voice edged with a mix of awe and fear. \\"And yet, they bring order where there was none. Under their rule, we might yet see a new dawn for Kyoto, for all of Japan,\\" a former National Diet member argued, seeing hope in the consolidation of power the Ōtsutsuki offered. As days turned to months, the Ōtsutsuki, leveraging both their advanced technology from Jurai and the mystical energy of chakra, began to reshape Kyoto. The ruins of the Imperial Palace became a nexus of their power, a symbol of their authority over this new domain. Kaguya, understanding the need for a harmonious rule, addressed the city's assembly, her voice imbued with a compelling aura, \\"We come not as conquerors, but as regents. With our guidance, Japan will rise from the ashes, stronger and more unified than before.\\" Her words, coupled with the demonstrable benefits of Ōtsutsuki stewardship — increased security, the beginnings of technological restoration, and an ordered society — quelled much of the initial skepticism. The remnants of the city's governance pledged their allegiance, the JSDF and police forces integrating with the Ōtsutsuki's own warriors. As the Ōtsutsuki clan solidified their grip on Kyoto, they began to extend their influence beyond, their sights set on unifying Japan under their rule. Kaguya, alongside her clan, delved into the studies of this new world, learning of its fractured states, its potential allies, and the threats that lay beyond their burgeoning empire. \\"We stand at the threshold of a new epoch,\\" Kaguya proclaimed to her council, \\"One where the legacy of the Ōtsutsuki will forge a new destiny for this world.\\" And so, from the ashes of the old, a new empire began to rise, an empire that would seek to reclaim the glory of the past while embracing the possibilities of the future, all under the watchful eyes of the Ōtsutsuki. --- The complexity of integrating numerous franchises into a single narrative while maintaining a grounded and cohesive storyline has necessitated focusing on key elements that drive the plot forward.

The descendant of low-class warrior Saiyans imprinted with only enough training to fight and conquer, Kakkarot [Dragon Ball franchise] is [Kakkarot] still [Kakkarot] sent to Earth to [Kakkarot] conquer it [Earth] sometime in the 500 AD period of human history as a baby, [Kakkarot] being [Kakkarot] adopted by Grandpa Gohan [Dragon Ball] after his [Kakkarot's] spaceship crashlanded on a hyperadvanced, semi-spacefaring version of ancient Earth, more specifically in the Han Chinese Imperial House of Yang-ruled Great Sui State/Sui dynasty ruling over Han China and [Kakkarot] being given the Chinese name of 'Sun Wukong' by Grandpa Gohan. After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs [Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z] and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled absolute imperial dynastic monarchy of the Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 21th century via [Wukong] taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, [Trunks's descendants] subsequently being absorbed into the Japanese as the centuries go on. Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire is [the Japanese Empire in this fic] restored [the Japanese Empire in this fanfic] as the government [the Japanese Empire] of Japan after the series of natural disasters, continent-wide wars and nuclear exchanges resulting in flames exploding around the world, devastating it [Earth] and leaving most parts of the planet uninhabitable, with continents being torn apart and some nations being utterly obliterated known as the Great Cataclysm [Fire Force], which [the Great Cataclysm in this story] is [the Great Cataclysm in this story] the same even as the global intercontinental military conflict and power bloc war within the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe that lasted from 2045 to 2064 and started as a result of a military conflict between the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled unitary presidential republic of the Russian Federation ruling over Siberia and the Russian Far East from Russia and the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Greater Manchuria over immigration due to global cooling starting around 2030 which was already worsened by advanced agricultural production becoming a solar-powered industry in 2020, leading to a temporary population boom [the conflict which lasted from 2045 to 2064 in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe] known as the Third World War [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] and the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], [the Third World War in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe being the same as the Great Cataclysm from Fire Force and the Invertia from Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku in this story] with the ancient clan of extra-terrestial horned humanoid creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] descended [ the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this fic] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke [Tenchi Muyo!] [this fic's Masaki dynasty-descended version of the Ōtsutsuki clan] acting as this neo-Japanese Empire's imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] fleeing [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] from the hidden-from the rest of the world, mythical, stuck on the feudal era of Japanese and the Ming and Song dynasty era of Chinese history politically, socially and economically, having the mythical combination of ki/qi and spiritual energy known as chakra-using fake shinobi and wuxia style cultivator mega continent known as the Elemental Nations [Naruto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] setting in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] being [what happened to the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] mistaken for [what the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic were |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| mistaken |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| for] the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, the real-life Japanese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato] by [who mistook the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the Imperial House of Great Yamato] the residents of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, this mistake [the residents of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto mistaking the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the surviving remnants of Imperial House of Great Yamato left in post-Great Cataclysm Japan] allowing it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] to [the Ōtsutsuki clan this fanfic] rebuild its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's in this fanfic's] new home [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] use it [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] as a base [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] for the eventual annhilation, conquest, absorption and assmilation of the myriad warlord states, bandit hideouts and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm, [the assimilation of the myriad of warlord states, bandit fiefdoms and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm by the fortified, rebuilt, restructured and rejuvinated post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] ending with the conquest and subsequent assmilation of the de-jure constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy but de facto theocratic industrial theocratic city state of the Raffles-dynasty ruled Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in post-Great Cataclysm Tokyo into the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule, which [the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] marked the reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule and the end of the post-Great Cataclysm warlord era in Japan. The creatures of Grimm [human and supernatural eating carnivorous monsters |Grimm| that |Grimm| do not |what the Grimm do not have| possess a soul, |the Grimm| being |what happens to the Grimm| drawn towards |what attracts the Grimms’ presence| negative emotions such as jealously, grief, loneliness, hatred and fear, |the Grimms’ attraction to negativity| causing them |the Grimms| to often congregate on the source of these emotions, |the Grimm| attacking any humans and supernatural creatures they |the Grimm| encounter on sight, |the Grimm| from |the media franchise the Grimm are (the Grimm) from| RWBY] also emerge after the Great Cataclysm all over the world along with the Infernals [former humans that spontaneous combust and |the Infernals| become |what the Infernals become after spontaneous combustion| misshapen fiery charcoal-like monsters, the Infernals being |what the Infernals are| a common feature and |the Infernals| a ever-present threat |the Infernals| in the post-Great Catalclysm world, |the Infernals| being |the Infernals| from |the franchise the Infernals are (the Infernals) from Fire Force] and the Gastrea [deadly parasites |Gastrea| that |Gastrea| transform |who Gastrea transform| their |the Gastrea’s| victims into |what the Gastrea transform their (the Gastrea’s victims) into mutated, superhuman, human-eating, powerful monsters (the endstage of a Gastrea infection), |the Gastrea| from |the media franchise the Gastrea are (the Gastrea) from| Black Bullet] Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. The reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule allows for the quick reconstruction and rebuilding of the country [Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule] and pre-Great Cataclysm luxuries such as electricity, bullet trains, the internet and running water soon return to Japan due to the merger of the Great Tokyo Empire's steampunk and dieselpunk technology with the advanced extraterrestrial technology and industry from brought from Jurai and the surviving pre- Great Cataclysm Japanese, American and even Russian technology left behind. In fact, the seizure of the unimaginably powerful flame or energy that be used to bring both creation and destruction, not connected to the physical laws of Earth but connected to collective minds, emotions, and perceptions of humanity known as the Adolla Burst [Fire Force]-powered infinite energy providing thermal-powered generator located in the Central Ward of the Tokyo Empire, the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" [Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \\"Amaterasu\\" |Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"|] from [the media franchise the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" is |the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"| from] Fire Force, [the seizure of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] during the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule is what will prove useful in the stability of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire. The Ōtsutsuki soon discover the presence of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, very manipulative, volatile and misanthropic nature Adolla Burst having survivor of the Great Cataclysm known only as Amaterasu [Fire Force] inside the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" after the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule and [the Ōtsutsuki] quickly rescue Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\", [ The Ōtsutsuki rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] copying her [Amaterasu's] Adolla Burst and placing the copy [of Amaterasu's Adolla Burst] inside the the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" to power it [ the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] while [The Ōtsutsuki after |The Ōtsutsuki| rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] scanning her [Amaterasu's] memories and [The Ōtsutsuki] discovering the presence of the extraterrestrial god-like entity with immense reality warping powers known only as the Evangelist [Fire Force] and its [the Evangelist's] cult organization with the goal of recreating the Great Cataclysm, the White Clad [Fire Force] within the Great Tokyo Empire's territories. The Ōtsutsuki soon begin constructions of replicas of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" all through post-Great Cataclysm Japan. Japan's Bicameral national legislature with the ability to pass laws and also to nominate the Japanese prime minister, consisting of a lower house, called the House of Representatives and an upper house, the House of Councillors, which [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] are [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] directly elected under a parallel voting system, the National Diet, [the National Diet] also resumes operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. In fact the bill that restores the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is passed through the National Diet. Japan’s central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system responsible for supervising Japan’s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters, under the Japanese Cabinet Office commission responsible for guaranteeing the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration, the National Public Safety Commission of the Japanese Cabinet Office, the Japanese National Police Agency, the elite tactical unit equivalent to the US Delta Force/US CIA SOG black ops death squads of the Japanese police force maintained by individual Japanese prefectural police forces and supervised by the Japanese National Police Agency and also national-level counterterrorism unit that cooperates with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads, the Special Assault Team, post-WW2's Japan's domestic intelligence agency administered by the Japanese Ministry of Justice tasked with internal security and espionage against threats to Japanese national security, contributing to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations, the Public Security Intelligence Agency and the post-WW2 Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet, reporting directly to the Japanese Prime Minister, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, [the Japanese NPA, the SAT, PISA and CIRO] soon resume their [the Japanese NPA's, the SAT's, PISA's and CIRO's] respective operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] along with the JSDF's special forces unit with a mission of infiltration into enemy territory, reconnaissance, sabotage, and hostage rescue, and conducting military operations against guerrillas or enemy commandos during wartime, the Special Forces Group, [the JSDF and SFG] also return to full operational capacity after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. SOG and SAT teams accompanied by PIRO agents with support given by CIRO under the direct supervision of the National Diet then begin covert operations against the White Clad in the Great Tokyo Empire's former territories, with White Clad members being captured in these operations being taken to black sites for processing and interrogation. Seperate teams of JSDF soliders and SOG agents along with SAT teams also begin Grimm [RWBY] and Infernal [Fire Force] extermination work within Japan. The Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], [the Tokkō] also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's combined military forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, [the IJAF] also make a return after the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, with the JSDF being reduced to a defence force. After the restoration of the IJAF in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, special influence is placed on the reconstruction of the Japanese Empire’s ground combat force and the land warfare division of the IJAF, the Imperial Japanese Army as a professional, well-trained army [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJA] living up to the best standards of the pre-Great Cataclysm world. the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The IJAF's elite Japanese special forces/airborne unit, the Teishin Shudan [Raiding Group |Teishin Shudan|], [the Teishin Shudan] is [the Teishin Shudan] also restored [the Teishin Shudan] after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [magnificent lineage |Kazoku|] is [the Kazoku] also restored [the Kazoku] in Japan the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The restoration of the imperial system [the Japanese Empire] in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] heavily influenced [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] by the pre-1868 Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial dynastic constitutional parliamentary monarchy but de facto feudal dynastic hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the heads of the Tokugawa clan being [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] restored [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] to their [the heads of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chiefs of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, |sei-i taishōgun| abbreviated |sei-i taishōgun| and more popularly known as shogun, |sei-i taishōgun| the hereditary military rulers |the sei-i taishōgun| of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868, |the sei-i taishōgun| having civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority]. The restored Tokugawa shoguns have a position more akin to that of the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the Germanic Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors] in days gone past however. The collection of various powers that supported the various shogunates of Japanese history and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the samurai] also make a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Thus, the restored Japanese Empire ruling over post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is formally known as the Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta [the Empire of Great Japan under the Tokugawa Tent Government |Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta|] or simply the Teikoku Bakufu [Imperial Shogunate |Teikoku Bakufu|]. After rebuilding its [Japan's] sociopolitical, military and governmental institutions and [Japan] restructuring itself, post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule seeks to reclaim all of the territories outside of the Japanese Home Islands that were once ruled by the Japanese Empire before 1947: mainly the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule first starts with Korea, which [Korea] is [Korea] in a state of chaos, disarray and confusion after the joint collapse of the Soviet satellite and later on post-Soviet Russia dictatorship of the Korean nationalist, Korean supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist Worker's Party of Korea-ruled totalitarian communist dictatorship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and the unitary presidential republic Republic of Korea occupying South Korea in the wake of the Great Cataclysm. The restored IJAF and buke quickly invades post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea and [The restored IJAF and buke] seize the area [post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea ] with ease, [The restored IJAF and buke during the invasion of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea] putting down Korean bandit and terrorist groups along with crime gangs and anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the ROKAF's strategic-level military command responsible for its [the ROKAF's] special operations forces, its members receiving special training for various unconventional warfare missions and whose primary tasks include guerrilla warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, direct action, collecting information in enemy territory and carrying out special missions including assassination, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command [ROKASWC] along with anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's primary domestic law enforcement agency run under the ROK's Ministry of the Interior and Safety, divided into 18 local police agencies and having local police forces within the ROK under its command, the Korean National Police Agency, the KNPA's specialized Police tactical unit trained to perform dangerous operations whose main mission is counter-terrorism, but it also can include serving high-risk arrest warrants, performing hostage rescue and/or armed intervention, and engaging heavily armed criminals, the SOU [Special Operations Unit] and the ROK's chief intelligence agency and secret police agency, having the responsibility to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the ROK's military along with the additional duties of collecting, coordinating, and distributing information on the ROK's strategy and security, the maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation's classified information, investigation of crimes affecting national security within the ROK, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law, investigation of crimes related to the missions of its staff, along with planning and coordination of information and classified, the National Intelligence Service. The remaining usable elements of the ROKAF and ROKASWC are absorbed into the JSDF and the SOG and the restored IJAF and the TS respectively with the same happening to the KNPA and the SOU with the Japanese NPA and SAT. The remaining usable elements of the NIS are also absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The surviving descendants of the pre-1910 indigenous Korean, slave-owning, sex-slave owning, backward, afraid of progress, Han China worshipping, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility who had immense influence in the post-1392 and pre-1898, Han-Chinese/Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled, backward, out of touch Ming and Qing tributary state of the feudal absolute dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Joeson State/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Joeson Kingdom/Joeson, the yangaban are [the yangaban descendants] suppressed [the yangaban descendants] by the restored IJAF and buke along with anti-Japanese, pro-Korean unification elements in post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The PSIA and CIRO launch a campaign in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea to identify and remove anti-Japanese elements, yangaban descendants and pro-Korean unification elements among the South Korean populace while also running a propaganda campaign that states that the return of Japan to the Korean peninsula after the Great Cataclysm and subsequent collapse of both the ROK and DPRK is a necessary measure for the salvation of the Japanese people. JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands pour into Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea in order to carry out disaster relief work and reconstruction efforts in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The Japanese NPA also starts taking over former KNPA stations and [the Japanese NPA] training new officers in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while also building new stations, with the SAT doing the same. The JSDF takes control of Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea from the restored IJAF and [the JSDF] starts taking over former ROKAF bases and US military bases located in South Korea, and [the JSDF] also begins constructing new bases in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while training and recruiting new servicemen. After the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea, the restored IJAF and buke then assault the former DPRK territory in North Korea from the DMZ border, [the restored IJAF and buke] seizing the former DRPK territory in North Korea with ease due to the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA performing military, political, and psychological operations, to create a \\"second front\\" in the enemy's rear area, and to conduct battlefield and strategic reconnaissance during open war, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ, the DPRK's domestic law enforcement agency in charge of the DPRK's police system along with operating the prison system in the DPRK, monitoring the public distribution system and providing bodyguards to important persons, the Ministry of Social Security, along with the DPRK's paramilitary force subordinate to the ministry which performs various internal security and border security tasks within the DPRK while being in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities, being the DPRK's combined national gendarmerie and civil defense organization organized in military lines, the Social Security Forces [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS, the RGB and the SSF] essentially being [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] unable to [the KPA, KPASOF, the MSS [State and Social] and the RGB] control the DPRK's population after the Great Cataclysm and [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] essentially unable to hold off the Japanese invaders. After the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the restored Japanese Empire takes steps to reintergrate the people of both North and South Korea into Japan. The usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF are [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] absorbed [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] into the restored IJAF, JSDF, SOG and the TS respectively after the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, with the same happening to the MSS [Social] and the Japanese NPA and the SSF and the SAT. The usable elements of the RGB are absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The concentration camps within the DPRK's territory once ran by the Ministry of State Security are dissolved by the restored IJAF and buke and the political prisoners in these concentration camps freed. Like in South Korea, the PSIA and CIRO both run a propaganda campaign while JSDF troops pour into the former DPRK from the Japanese Home Islands, doing disaster relief and reconstruction efforts while putting down Russian loyalists and remnants of the WPK and former DPRK government in South Korea. The JSDF also takes over former KPA bases in the former DPRK and [the JSDF] begins constructing new bases in the former DPRK, [the JSDF] training ethnic North Korean recruits. The Japanese NPA also takes over police stations formerly run by the Ministry of Social Security and begins constructing new ones. After the conquest of both post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK North Korea and post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen as the government [Chōsen] of the entire Korean peninsula. Sometime after the reconquest of Korea and the restoration of Chōsen as its [ post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK and post ROK Korea's] government, the Japanese then turn their [the Japanese's] attention to the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands which they [the Japanese] conquer with ease. The post-1907, pre-1947 Japanese province of Karufuto is [Karufuto] restored [Karufuto] as the government [Karufuto] of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands after their [the Sakhalin's and Kuril Islands's] joint reconquest by the Japanese. After the reconquest of Korea, the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, Japan turns its [Japan's] attention towards Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, which [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] have [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] been [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] in chaos ever since the fall of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China which [Nationalist China] had [Nationalist China] been in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1949 after the latter [the KMT and Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War of 1947-1949 to [the political party and geopolitical entity the KMT and Nationalist China jointly lost the Chinese Civil War to] the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Manchuria, [the collapse of Nationalist China in exile in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1947] as a result of the Great Cataclysm. The Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies/criminal organizations known as the Triads taking up residence in post-Great Cataclysm, post-KMT and Nationalist China Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with the post-Great Cataclysm surviving renmants of the ROCAF's elite special forces unit tasked with carring out special operations, including decaptation strikes in the events of a war, the Airborne Special Service Company, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency which [the Nationalist Chinese NPA] falls under the Nationalist Chinese Ministry of the Interior and [the NPA] oversees all all police forces within National China on a national level, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency's specialist unit and highly trained police tactical unit conducting high-risk arrests and other dangerous law enforcement duties, the Thunder Squad along with Nationalist China's principal intelligence agency created to supervise and coordinate all security-related administrative organizations, military agencies and KMT organizations in Taiwan, gathering, International intelligence, Intelligence within the area of People's Republic of China, Intelligence within the area of Taiwan, Analysis of the nation's strategic intelligence, , Scientific and technological intelligence and telecommunications security, Control and development of secret codes (the matrix) and facilities, Armed Forces Internet Security while also taking charge of planning special tasks and is responsible for guiding, coordinating, and supporting the intelligence affairs in military and civil categories in addition to managing intelligence relevant to national security, the National Security Bureau are no match for the restored IJAF and buke and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] quickly reintergated [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese imperial fold. The usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC are [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] quickly integrated [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] into the restored IJAF and the JSDF along with the restored TS and the SOG with the useable elements of the Nationalist Chinese NPA and Thunder Squad being absorbed into the Japanese NPA and Thunder Squad. The usable elements of the NSB are [the usable elements of the NSB] absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. Like in the Korean peninsula, JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands come down to Taiwan to engage in disaster relief and reconstruction and rebuilding work, while [the JSDF] taking over former US military bases and former ROCAF bases in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and [the JSDF] constructing new bases [in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. After the reconquest of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Japanese take special measures to reintergrate the majority population in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and also the main indigenous group in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands the Taiwan-based sub-branch of the Han Chinese subgroup who speak Hokkien and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo Taiwanese along with the other indigenous groups in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese social, political and economic structure. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the large, powerful villain organization turned secret society and paramilitary underworld group that follows the philosophy that the free usage of Quirks is a basic human right, emphasizing liberation over-regulation [of Quirks], the Inō Kaihō-gun [Meta Liberation

From it stepped beings of majestic aura, their eyes reflecting the wisdom of ages and the burdens of interdimensional voyages. These were the Ōtsutsuki clan, refugees from the Elemental Nations, fleeing the aftermath of a devastating series of events that had left their world in ruins. Led by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, a figure of both beauty and power, the clan made their way through the desolate streets of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto. Their arrival did not go unnoticed. The survivors, weary and desperate for a glimmer of hope, watched from the shadows, whispering amongst themselves. To their eyes, the Ōtsutsuki were nothing less than deities, descended from the heavens to restore order to a world gone mad. Indeed, Kaguya and her kin were mistaken for the remnants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato. It was a misunderstanding that the Ōtsutsuki did not correct, for they understood the advantage their perceived divine ancestry gave them. They quietly assumed the mantle of protectors, consolidating their hold over Kyoto with a mix of benevolence and an iron will, enforced by their exceptional abilities. Toneri Ōtsutsuki, a young but talented member of the clan, found himself fascinated by the technology and structures of this new world. His Byakugan surveyed the Kyoto Imperial Palace, a building that had stood the test of time and calamity. \\"It seems fate has led us here, where the past and future intertwine,\\" he mused to himself, the white of his eyes piercing through the shadows. Meanwhile, Kimimaro, another clan member gifted with the Shikotsumyaku Kekkei Genkai, worked alongside the remnants of the Japanese NPA and the JSDF. Together, they cleared Kyoto of bandits and warlords, using his unparalleled bone-manipulating abilities to protect and intimidate. His presence on the battlefield, a dance of lethal grace, inspired awe among the allies and fear among their foes. As days turned into months, the Ōtsutsuki clan established a new order within the city. Kaguya, with her inscrutable wisdom, led meetings with the remnants of Japan's government structures, weaving together the remnants of pre-Cataclysm society with the advanced knowledge the clan brought from Jurai and their own world. The Kyoto Imperial Palace was transformed into a clan compound, serving as both their headquarters and a symbol of their custodianship over Kyoto. Sat in the grand hall of what was once the Imperial Palace, Kaguya addressed her new subjects and the allies they had found among the Japanese leadership. \\"Together, we stand at the dawn of a new era,\\" she proclaimed, her voice a melodious command that resonated through the marbled corridors. \\"With your faith and our guidance, we shall rebuild what was lost and forge a future filled with promise.\\" Meanwhile, scientists and scholars of the Ōtsutsuki clan delved into the mysteries of this world, intrigued by the relics of advanced technology and the remnants of magical prowess scattered across the globe. Toneri, ever curious, led expeditions beyond Kyoto, seeking out the Festa of Rikka and the thought elevators of the Brittanian Empire, determined to understand the forces that had shaped this planet's destiny. Amidst this weaving of new alliances and the establishment of a new order, the Ōtsutsuki never forgot their origins nor the lessons of their tumultuous past. They knew that peace was a delicate treasure, one that required strength, wisdom, and, above all, unity to maintain. In the heart of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, under the watchful gaze of beings from another world, a new chapter in human history was being written, one where the magic of the old mingled with the promise of the new, heralding the rise of a civilization unlike any before."},{"instruction":"основные этапы образования ангиотензина II","output":"Ангиотензин II — это важный регуляторный пептид, играющий ключевую роль в контроле артериального давления и объёма внеклеточной жидкости, включая кровь. Процесс образования ангиотензина II включает несколько этапов: 1. **Образование ангиотензиногена**: Первым этапом является синтез ангиотензиногена. Ангиотензиноген — это гликопротеин, который производится в основном печенью и выделяется в кровоток. 2. **Преобразование ангиотензиногена в ангиотензин I**: Ангиотензиноген преобразуется в ангиотензин I под действием фермента, известного как ренин. Ренин вырабатывается почками и высвобождается в кровоток, где он соприкасается с ангиотензиногеном и отщепляет от него фрагмент, превращая его в декапептид — ангиотензин I. 3. **Преобразование ангиотензина I в ангиотензин II**: Далее, ангиотензин I преобразуется в ангиотензин II, что является более активной формой, с помощью фермента ангиотензинпревращающего фермента (АПФ или ACE). АПФ присутствует в различных тканях организма, но в основном в легких и сосудистом эндотелии. Ангиотензин II обладает мощным сосудосуживающим действием, что приводит к повышению артериального давления. 4. **Функции ангиотензина II**: После формирования, ангиотензин II вызывает сужение кровеносных сосудов (вазоконстрикцию), повышает артериальное давление и стимулирует высвобождение альдостерона из коры надпочечников. Альдостерон способствует удержанию натрия и воды в организме, что дополнительно увеличивает объем крови и артериальное давление. Также ангиотензин II влияет на центр жажды в мозге, стимулируя потребление воды. Эти этапы представляют собой ключевые моменты в ренин-ангиотензиновой системе (РАС), которая играет центральную роль в регуляции кровяного давления и баланса жидкостей в организме. Многочисленные лекарства, направленные на блокировку различных компонентов РАС, используются для лечения гипертонии и связанных с ней заболеваний."},{"instruction":"известные факторы, влияющие на выработку ренина и эффекты ангиотензина II.","output":"Выработка ренина и эффекты ангиотензина II оказывают значительное влияние на кардиоваскулярную систему и гомеостаз жидкости в организме. На их активность влияет множество факторов: # Факторы, влияющие на выработку ренина: 1. **Снижение артериального давления**: Снижение давления в артериях, ведущих к почкам, стимулирует выработку ренина. 2. **Снижение содержания натрия**: Уменьшение концентрации натрия, фильтруемого почечными клубочками, активизирует аппарат Юкстагломерулярных клеток к секреции ренина. 3. **Симпатическая нервная активация**: Стимуляция β1-адренорецепторов Юкстагломерулярного аппарата симпатическими нервными волокнами может увеличивать выработку ренина. # Эффекты ангиотензина II: 1. **Вазоконстрикция**: Ангиотензин II вызывает сужение периферических сосудов, что помогает увеличить артериальное давление. 2. **Высвобождение альдостерона**: Стимулирует кору надпочечников к выработке альдостерона, который, в свою очередь, увеличивает реабсорбцию натрия и воды почками, ведя к повышению объема крови и давления. 3. **Стимуляция жажды и увеличение приема воды**: Ангиотензин II действует на гипоталамус, вызывая жажду и повышая потребление воды. 4. **Фасцилитация высвобождения норадреналина**: Ангиотензин II может фасцилитировать высвобождение норадреналина из симпатических нервных окончаний, усиливая сосудосуживающий эффект. 5. **Прямое действие на сердце и сосуды**: Ангиотензин II может усиливать гипертрофию и ремоделирование сердечной мышцы и сосудистой стенки. 6. **Влияние на реабсорбцию натрия в почках**: Помимо действия альдостерона, ангиотензин II напрямую усиливает реабсорбцию натрия в проксимальных почечных канальцах. # Регуляторные механизмы и внешние факторы - **Перепады давления и объем крови в организме**: Отрицательная обратная связь между объемом циркулирующей крови/артериальным давлением и выработкой ренина обеспечивает постоянство внутренней среды организма. - **Рацион питания**: Уровни потребления натрия и влаги напрямую влияют на активность ренин-ангиотензиновой системы. - **Лекарственные вещества**: Ингибиторы АПФ, блокаторы рецепторов ангиотензина II, диуретики и другие виды медикаментов могут влиять на активность и эффективность ренин-ангиотензиновой системы. - **Гормоны**: Некоторые гормоны, в том числе адреналин и норадреналин, могут влиять на выработку ренина.

This concept blends the fantasy elements inherent in her character with the science fiction motifs typical of the cyberpunk genre, potentially creating a rich narrative canvas. Here’s how this twist could add depth and excitement to the storyline: # Enhanced Theming 1. **Integration of Fantasy and Sci-Fi:** Cyberpunk is a genre that often examines the intersection of humanity with advanced technology. Adding a character who is a literal fusion of a fantastical creature (dragon) and a human can serve as a metaphor for themes central to cyberpunk, such as the blurring lines between the natural and artificial or the exploration of identity in a tech-saturated world. 2. **Unique Abilities:** As a dragon hybrid, Daenerys could have unique abilities that set her apart and elevate her role. These could range from physical enhancements (like strength or resilience) to more fantastical powers (like fire resistance or even a form of technologically-assisted telepathy with machines or networks, mirroring her connection with dragons in the original story). These abilities could serve critical plot points or character development arcs. # Plot Development 1. **Conflict and Challenge:** Her hybrid nature could place Daenerys at the center of significant conflict, whether with factions seeking to control or destroy her due to fear of her power or with her own internal struggle regarding her identity and place in the world. This conflict can drive the narrative, providing stakes and motivations that resonate with cyberpunk’s dystopian undertones. 2. **Unique Relationships:** This twist would inevitably affect Daenerys's relationships with other characters. Her journey could involve finding allies who accept her for who she is, perhaps drawing parallels with other marginalized groups within the cyberpunk setting. It could also introduce intriguing dynamics with characters who have their enhancements or mutations, exploring themes of kinship and solidarity. # World-Building 1. **Technological Integration:** The story could explore how Daenerys's dragon aspects are the result of advanced biotechnology, genetic engineering, or even cybernetic enhancements. This aspect would allow for deep dives into the lore’s science and technology, showing how such a transformation is possible and what implications it holds for the world at large. 2. **Societal Implications:** Daenerys’s existence and any others like her could challenge societal norms within the story, prompting questions about humanity, sovereignty, and what it means to be \\"natural\\" in a world where technology can fundamentally alter beings. In conclusion, transforming Daenerys into a dragon hybrid in a GoT cyberpunk AU could offer a compelling narrative device, enriching the world-building, theming, and character dynamics of the story. This twist would not only provide unique opportunities for exploring the core tenets of the cyberpunk genre but also reinvent Daenerys’s character in a way that honors her original essence while presenting her with new, fascinating challenges to overcome."},{"instruction":"Экскретируемая фракция вещества что это такое","output":"Экскретируемая фракция вещества (от лат. excernere — выделять) — это термин, используемый в медицине и биологии, который обозначает долю (процент) конкретного вещества, которое выделяется из организма в неизменном виде, особенно через почки с мочой. Этот показатель важен для понимания того, как организм удаляет определенные вещества, включая лекарственные препараты, токсины и продукты метаболизма. Рассчитать экскретируемую фракцию можно, зная концентрацию вещества в плазме крови и в моче, а также скорость клубочковой фильтрации (СКФ) и скорость образования мочи. Это позволяет оценить эффективность работы выделительной системы, а также процессы реабсорбции (обратного всасывания) и секреции (выделения) в почечных канальцах. Для лекарственных средств экскретируемая фракция позволяет определить, сколько препарата выводится из организма в неизменном виде, а это важно для корректировки дозы у пациентов с нарушениями функции почек и для избежания возможного накопления вещества в организме до токсических концентраций."},{"instruction":"Клиренс вещества что это в физиологии","output":"Клиренс вещества в физиологии — это объем плазмы крови (или крови), который полностью освобождается от данного вещества за единицу времени.

Клиренс выражается обычно в миллилитрах в минуту (мл/мин) и является важной характеристикой для понимания функционального состояния органов, задействованных в процессах очистки крови, особенно почек. Клиренс может быть применен к различным веществам, включая креатинин, мочевину, лекарства и гормоны. Существует несколько типов клиренса, самым известным из которых является почечный клиренс, отражающий способность почек удалять вещество из кровотока. Кроме того, печеночный клиренс описывает функцию печени в процессах детоксикации и метаболизма веществ. Расчет клиренса может быть выполнен с использованием различных формул, в зависимости от вещества и контекста. Одной из основных формул является: [ text{Клиренс} = frac{text{Скорость выведения вещества}}{text{Концентрация вещества в плазме крови}} ] Где скорость выведения вещества часто определяется через количество вещества, обнаруженное в моче, а концентрация вещества в плазме позволяет учесть его «нагрузку» на организм.

Этот показатель имеет важное значение для понимания механизмов поглощения и выведения веществ из организма, таких как глюкоза, аминокислоты и различные ионы. Транспортный максимум характеризуется тем, что механизмы активного транспорта веществ через клеточные мембраны насыщаются при достижении определенной концентрации вещества. Это означает, что транспортные белки, ответственные за перенос вещества, работают на полную мощность, и увеличение концентрации вещества выше этого предела не приведет к увеличению его транспорта. Примером может служить транспортная система для реабсорбции глюкозы в почках. До определенного уровня концентрации глюкозы в крови ее реабсорбция в почечных канальцах происходит полностью. Однако, если концентрация глюкозы превышает пороговое значение, которое может обработать транспортная система (транспортный максимум для глюкозы), излишки глюкозы не реабсорбируются и выводятся с мочой, что наблюдается при сахарном диабете.

Фильтрационная нагрузка часто вычисляется для оценки работы клубочков — микроскопических структур в почках, где и происходит фильтрация крови. Фильтрационная нагрузка зависит от двух основных параметров: 1. **Скорость клубочковой фильтрации (СКФ)**: это объем плазмы крови (обычно в мл/мин), который фильтруется почками за единицу времени. СКФ — ключевой показатель здоровья почек, позволяющий оценить, насколько эффективно они справляются со своей работой. 2. **Концентрация вещества в плазме крови**: величина, показывающая, сколько конкретного вещества находится в крови, поступающей в почки для фильтрации. Фильтрационная нагрузка для конкретного вещества (например, глюкозы) рассчитывается как произведение СКФ на его концентрацию в плазме крови. Это дает представление о том, какое количество этого вещества почки должны обработать за определенный промежуток времени. Таким образом, фильтрационная нагрузка важна для оценки функциональной способности почек фильтровать кровь и определения их адаптации к изменениям в метаболизме организма. В стандартных условиях, при здоровой работе почек и нормальном уровне веществ в крови, фильтрационная нагрузка поддерживается в оптимальных пределах. Нарушения, связанные с увеличением фильтрационной нагрузки, могут указывать на проблемы с почечной функцией или изменения в составе крови."},{"instruction":"Write a hilarious script where the Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic Scrappy-Doo have a funny chat behind the scenes and react to misheard lyrics that i read out, laughing and hilariously question and hilariously roast errors and inconsistencies that make no sense in the misheard lyrics and the names of stuff with occasional funny quotes mocking a situation, in my prompt in a hilarious comedy 17+ way: (The gang constantly imagine and make silly quotes to mock the misheard lyrics) Reader: Ok gang get this… * I start reading the whole thing to the gang, who let me lay it on.

Стартовая вершина 1 - алгоритм должен вернуть путь обхода - 1, 3.","output":"Для реализации алгоритма обхода графа в глубину (DFS - Depth-First Search) на Python, сначала необходимо представить граф в удобной для обработки форме. Один из простых способов – использовать словарь, где ключами будут вершины, а значениями – списки смежных вершин. Рассмотрим предложенный пример, где пары вершин, соединенных ребром, это: (4, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4). Стартовой вершиной является 1. Сначала определим функцию для добавления ребер в граф, а затем реализуем DFS. \`\`\`python def add_edge(graph, u, v): if u not in graph: graph[u] = [] if v not in graph: graph[v] = [] graph[u].append(v) # Если граф направленный, добавляем только здесь graph[v].append(u) # Для неориентированного графа добавляем оба направления def dfs(graph, start, visited=None): if visited is None: visited = set() visited.add(start) print(start, end=\\" \\") for next_node in graph[start]: if next_node not in visited: dfs(graph, next_node, visited) return # Пример создания графа и вызова функции обхода graph = {} add_edge(graph, 4, 2) add_edge(graph, 1, 3) add_edge(graph, 2, 4) # Это ребро уже добавлено из предыдущего добавления, но повтор не влияет start_vertex = 1 print(\\"Путь обхода:\\") dfs(graph, start_vertex) \`\`\` Этот код сначала создает граф с заданным списком ребер, а затем выполняет обход в глубину из указанной начальной точки. Вывод будет представлять собой порядок посещения вершин при таком обходе. На заметку, что из-за неопределенности порядка хранения ключей в словаре Python 3.6+ (до версии 3.6 порядок был неопределен) и списках смежности, конкретный порядок обхода может варьироваться между различными запусками программы, если не использовать упорядоченные коллекции или не задавать порядок следования рёбер явно."},{"instruction":"Измени исходный код, чтобы алгоритм осуществлял не только обход в глубину, но и возвращал длину пути от вершины a до вершины b - (a и b - входные параметры алгоритма. пример - входные параметры это пары вершин, которые между собой соединены ребром - 4 2, 1 3, 2 4.

В этом подходе каждый вызов функции обхода будет возвращать два значения: флаг, указывающий на то, найдена ли искомая вершина, и текущую длину пути до нее. Изменим код с учетом этих требований: \`\`\`python def add_edge(graph, u, v): if u not in graph: graph[u] = [] if v not in graph: graph[v] = [] graph[u].append(v) graph[v].append(u) def dfs(graph, current, destination, visited=None, depth=0): if visited is None: visited = set() if current == destination: return True, depth visited.add(current) for next_node in graph[current]: if next_node not in visited: found, d = dfs(graph, next_node, destination, visited, depth+1) if found: return True, d return False, 0 # Пример использования graph = {} add_edge(graph, 4, 2) add_edge(graph, 1, 3) add_edge(graph, 2, 4) start_vertex = 2 end_vertex = 4 found, path_length = dfs(graph, start_vertex, end_vertex) if found: print(f\\"Длина пути от {start_vertex} до {end_vertex}: {path_length}\\") else: print(f\\"Путь от {start_vertex} до {end_vertex} не найден.\\") \`\`\` Этот код предполагает, что: 1. Граф неориентированный, так как каждое добавленное ребро связывает две вершины в обоих направлениях. 2. Мы ищем кратчайший путь между двумя вершинами. Алгоритм DFS не всегда находит самый короткий путь в терминах количества рёбер, особенно в сложносвязных графах, но с учетом заданных условий, он найдет путь, если таковой существует, и вернет его длину как количество ребер, которое нужно пройти от вершины (a) до (b). 3. Функция возвращает 0, если путь не найден, что может случиться, если вершины (b) нет в той же компоненте связности, что и (a). Обратите внимание, что этот алгоритм оптимизирован для поиска пути между двумя заданными вершинами и может не эффективно работать для нахождения кратчайших путей в графе общего вида, для чего лучше подходят алгоритмы, такие как BFS (поиск в ширину), Дейкстры или Беллмана-Форда в зависимости от характеристик графа."},{"instruction":"Когда добавляешь коммит в гитхаб, даже если файл уже был создан нужно ли повторно писать git add","output":"Команда \`git add\` используется для добавления изменений в индекс (также называемый \\"staging area\\") перед их коммитом в репозиторий Git. Когда вы вносите изменения в файл, который уже отслеживается Git (т.е., файл был добавлен в репозиторий ранее), вам действительно нужно использовать команду \`git add\` для того, чтобы добавить эти последние изменения в индекс перед коммитом. Другими словами, если вы изменяете файл после того, как он уже был коммитом добавлен в репозиторий, вам нужно снова использовать \`git add\` для этих изменений, прежде чем они смогут быть зафиксированы в новом коммите. Есть несколько применений \`git add\`: - **Первоначальное добавление файла:** когда вы создаете новый файл в репозитории и хотите, чтобы он был отслеживаемым Git, вы используете \`git add\` для добавления файла. - **Добавление изменений в существующем файле:** когда вы изменяете файл, уже находящийся под управлением Git, и хотите, чтобы эти изменения были включены в следующий коммит. - **Добавление части изменений в файле:** Git также позволяет вам выборочно добавлять изменения в файлы, если вы хотите коммитить их по частям (используя, например, \`git add -p\`). Важно помнить, что \`git add\` не только для \\"новых\\" файлов; это также способ сказать Git, что вы хотите включить последние изменения в файле или наборе файлов в следующий коммит. # Зачем нужен этот дополнительный шаг? Этот промежуточный шаг даёт вам больше контроля над тем, что входит в коммит. Вы можете изменить несколько файлов, но решить, что хотите сделать коммит только для части этих изменений. \`git add\` позволяет вам выборочно добавлять изменения в индекс для следующего коммита, что является полезной функцией для поддержания чистоты и организации истории изменений."},{"instruction":"Как обновить внесенные изменения в репозиторий локально","output":"Чтобы обновить локальную копию репозитория с учетом изменений, сделанных в удаленном репозитории (например, на GitHub), вы можете использовать несколько команд Git в зависимости от ваших потребностей. Вот основные из них: # \`git fetch\` Команда \`git fetch\` загружает последние изменения из удаленного репозитория, но не объединяет их с вашей текущей рабочей веткой. Это хороший способ увидеть, какие изменения были сделаны в удаленном репозитории, не влияя на вашу локальную рабочую копию. После выполнения \`git fetch\`, вы можете объединить эти изменения в вашу текущую ветку с помощью \`git merge\` или просмотреть их, используя \`git diff\` или другие команды для инспекции. # \`git pull\` Команда \`git pull\` фактически является сочетанием двух команд: \`git fetch\`, за которым следует \`git merge\`. Эта команда автоматически загружает и объединяет изменения из удаленного репозитория в текущую ветку вашего локального репозитория. Это удобная команда для быстрого приведения вашей ветки в соответствие с удаленной веткой, но следует быть осторожным, так как могут возникнуть конфликты слияния, которые вам придется решать вручную. # Конфликты слияния Если после выполнения \`git pull\` или \`git merge\` возникают конфликты слияния, Git потребует от вас их разрешения, прежде чем вы сможете продолжить. Вы должны ручным образом отредактировать файлы, содержащие конфликты, выбрав нужные изменения, а затем добавить измененные файлы обратно в индекс с помощью \`git add\` и завершить процесс слияния, сделав коммит. # Выборочное обновление Если вы хотите обновить только определенные файлы или папки из удаленного репозитория, а не всю ветку целиком, вы можете использовать команду \`git checkout\` или \`git restore\` (начиная с Git 2.23), указывая конкретный путь после выполнения \`git fetch\`: \`\`\`bash git fetch origin git checkout origin/master -- path/to/file \`\`\` или \`\`\`bash git fetch origin git restore --source=origin/master --staged --worktree -- path/to/file \`\`\` Это позволит вам обновить локальные файлы до состояния, которое они имеют в удаленном репозитории, без полного слияния или переключения веток.

Write an essay that examines the hubris of multiple characters. Your essay should 1) demonstrate how each character’s hubris is depicted in the text, and 2) explain why each character’s hubris has led to a kind of downfall. Do your chosen characters share the same fate? Or what do the differences in their fate tell us about the severity of their hubris?","output":"Hubris is a recurring motif in literature, serving as a cautionary tale about the perils of excessive pride and arrogance. Often, characters afflicted with hubris find themselves facing dire consequences, sometimes leading to their downfall or death. This essay examines the hubris of three iconic literary characters: Oedipus from Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex,\\" Victor Frankenstein from Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" and Jay Gatsby from F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Each of these characters' excessive pride not only precipitates their own downfall but also offers a broader commentary on human nature and the dangers of overreaching. Oedipus, the tragic hero of Sophocles' drama, is a quintessential example of how hubris can lead to a character's downfall. Oedipus's determination to defy the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother is rooted in his prideful belief that he can overcome fate itself. \\"I will never be convicted of the same man's murder twice,\\" Oedipus declares, demonstrating his unwavering confidence in his ability to control his destiny (Sophocles, \\"Oedipus Rex\\"). This excessive pride blinds him to the truth and ultimately leads to his ruin – he fulfills the prophecy, kills his father, marries his mother, and, upon realizing his actions, blinds himself and is exiled. His hubris, therefore, not only leads to personal tragedy but also a disruption in the natural and societal order. Victor Frankenstein, in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" exhibits hubris through his ambition to transcend the limitations of scientific knowledge and create life. His obsessive pursuit of creating the monster reflects his god-like aspirations, indicative of his arrogance. Frankenstein himself admits, \\"Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world\\" (Shelley, \\"Frankenstein\\"). However, his lack of foresight and responsibility towards his creation results in the deaths of his loved ones and his own despairing pursuit of the monster. Frankenstein's hubris not only leads to his downfall but also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked human ambition and the ethical considerations of scientific exploration. Jay Gatsby from \\"The Great Gatsby\\" embodies hubris in his relentless pursuit of the American Dream, symbolized through his love for Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby's belief in the green light at the end of Daisy's dock represents his belief in the attainability of his dream, despite the insurmountable societal and personal obstacles. Fitzgerald captures Gatsby's hubris in his unwavering belief that he can recreate the past and achieve his vision of happiness: \\"Can't repeat the past?...Why of course you can!\\" (Fitzgerald, \\"The Great Gatsby\\"). However, Gatsby's excessive pride and obsession with an idealized vision of life lead to his untimely death, underscoring the destructive consequences of hubris intertwined with the American Dream. In conclusion, the hubris of Oedipus, Victor Frankenstein, and Jay Gatsby illustrates a profound literary theme: excessive pride leads to downfall. While each character's pride manifests in different aspirations - defiance of fate, scientific achievement, and the pursuit of an idealized dream – they share a common fate of ruin. Oedipus's catastrophe stems from his attempt to escape destiny, Frankenstein's from his god-like ambition to create life, and Gatsby's from his obsession with an unattainable past. These narratives serve as cautionary tales, illustrating the destructive potential of hubris and the inherent human flaw of overreaching beyond one’s limits."},{"instruction":"Write a hilarious script where the Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic Scrappy-Doo have a funny chat behind the scenes and react to misheard lyrics that i read out, laughing and hilariously question and hilariously roast errors and inconsistencies that make no sense in the misheard lyrics and the names of stuff with occasional funny quotes mocking a situation, in my prompt in a hilarious comedy 17+ way: (The gang constantly imagine and make silly quotes to mock the misheard lyrics) Reader: Ok gang get this… * I start reading the whole thing to the gang, who let me lay it on.

This is because diversity brings about innovation and creativity. I am writing about one of my friends experience who is employed as a software engineer at a company in Sweden. He comes from Iran, a country where most of its people are Muslim. Respect is a fundamental value deeply ingrained in Iranian culture. It is common for employees to address each other using formal titles and to show deference to those in positions of authority. Colleagues are expected to treat each other with professionalism. In Sweden, respect in the workplace is also highly valued, but the approach may differ slightly. Swedish workplace culture emphasizes equality with a flatter organizational structure and a more informal communication style. Colleagues in Sweden address each other by first names regardless of their position. Additionally, Swedes prioritize work-life balance and respect for personal boundaries to have a healthy lifestyle. He found it challenging to address his manager by name and tried to refuse to call him. Another cultural difference he faced was the communication style - Swedes are known for their direct and open communication, often expressing opinions and feedback openly in meetings. This may contrast with the more indirect and polite communication style typically seen in Iranian culture, where feedback may be given subtly or less directly. Upon receiving direct feedback for the first time, he experienced feelings of embarrassment and a loss of motivation, as he questioned his adequacy for the position. Additionally, the emphasis on teamwork and collaboration in Swedish workplaces may differ from the hierarchical structure often found in Iranian companies. In Sweden, company decisions are usually made through consensus rather than by a single authority figure, which is a challenge for an Iranian employee used to a more hierarchical work environment. Moreover, the concept of work-life balance is highly valued in Sweden, where employees are provided with ample paid time off to recharge and enhance their productivity. Consequently, he has been able to perform at his best and significantly improved his job within a short period. Regarding dress codes, each company establishes its own guidelines. Each company’s dress code can also reflect the company’s commitment to diversity and respect for different cultural backgrounds. Islamic traditions influence the dress code in Iran, and men and women are expected to dress modestly to adhere to religious guidelines. In Iran, individuals are expected to adhere to Islamic dress codes regardless of their personal preferences. In contrast, Sweden tends to have a more relaxed and casual approach to dress codes in the workplace. Swedes often prioritize comfort and functionality in their attire, with many employees opting for smart-casual or business-casual outfits. My friend feels more relaxed working in Sweden as he can freely choose his attire. However, the absence of specific dress code guidelines initially caused confusion and misunderstandings for him. Conflict resolution approaches in Sweden and Iran can differ based on cultural norms and communication styles. In Sweden, conflicts are often addressed openly and directly through open communication, collaborative problem-solving, and a focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions. Swedes value honesty, transparency, and constructive dialogue in resolving conflicts, emphasizing maintaining relationships and harmony within the workplace. Conversely, in Iran, conflict resolution may involve a more indirect approach, influenced by cultural norms that emphasize politeness, respect for authority, and preserving harmony within social relationships. Face-saving and avoiding public confrontation are key considerations in resolving conflicts in Iranian culture.","output":"The analysis of this experience highlights the significance of cultural diversity in the workplace and the impact it can have on both individuals and organizations. In this case, the Iranian software engineer faced challenges in adapting to the Swedish workplace culture, including differences in communication styles, hierarchy, work-life balance, and dress codes. One key takeaway is the importance of understanding and respecting cultural differences in the workplace. Misunderstandings and conflicts can arise when individuals from different cultural backgrounds are not aware of or sensitive to each other's cultural norms and values. In this case, the software engineer struggled with direct communication and feedback, as well as navigating the more egalitarian and informal Swedish work environment. On the positive side, diversity can lead to innovation and creativity by bringing together individuals with different perspectives, experiences, and ideas. In this case, the software engineer was able to learn and adapt to the Swedish workplace culture, ultimately improving his performance and job satisfaction. This demonstrates the potential benefits of diversity in enhancing individual growth and organizational success. Furthermore, the analysis also underscores the importance of creating inclusive and supportive workplace environments that accommodate and celebrate cultural diversity. This includes providing training and resources for employees to learn about different cultural norms and practices, as well as promoting open communication, respect, and understanding among colleagues. Overall, this experience illustrates how diversity in the workplace can enrich the organizational culture, foster learning and growth, and ultimately contribute to the overall success and effectiveness of the organization. By embracing and celebrating cultural diversity, organizations can harness the unique strengths and talents of their employees, leading to greater innovation, collaboration, and success."},{"instruction":"is this a legit concern?..quitting sales job after one day because I don’t want to drive around neighborhoods knocking on doors to sell home security systems to people?

Here are some factors that might help you decide: 1. **Your Comfort Level**: If the idea of going door-to-door makes you uncomfortable or anxious, it's a valid concern. These feelings might not go away even with more training, and if the job makes you unhappy from the start, it might not be the right fit for you. 2. **Job Relevance to Your Future Goals**: Since you mentioned you're still studying IT, consider how this job aligns with your future career goals. If this job doesn't offer skills or experiences that will be beneficial in your intended career path, it might not be worth the stress and discomfort. 3. **Financial Needs vs. Career Satisfaction**: While the main draw of the job is the money, it's important to weigh the financial benefits against your personal satisfaction and mental health. If the job will make you miserable, the money might not be worth it, especially if you have the support of your parents right now and aren't under immediate financial pressure to take any job you can get. 4. **Opportunity Cost**: Consider what other opportunities you might be missing out on while working in this job. Could the time spent here be better used focusing on your IT studies or looking for internships or jobs more closely related to your field of interest? 5. **Employer's Reaction**: Most employers understand that job fit is crucial for both the employee and the company. If you approach your employer professionally and explain your reasons for leaving respectfully, they’re likely to understand, especially since you're still in the training phase. 6. **Learning Experience**: While you weren't primarily interested in sales, there can be valuable skills gained from such positions, including enhanced communication, resilience, and perhaps a better understanding of what you do and do not want in a job. Yet, these benefits need to be balanced against your discomfort and the potential stress of the job. If after considering these factors you decide that the job is not right for you, it may be best to quit sooner rather than later. This allows your employer to quickly find a replacement and minimizes the time you spend in a role that isn’t a good fit for you. However, take this as a learning experience for the future to ask more questions about job roles during interviews and to seek positions more aligned with your interests and career goals."},{"instruction":"Donner un exemple de processus de sélection naturelle","output":"La sélection naturelle pourrait être observée dans le cas des pinsons des îles Galápagos.

Here are several factors to consider that might help you make an informed decision: 1. **Job Misalignment**: It sounds like the job is not aligning with your interests or career goals, especially since your background is in IT and not sales. Taking a job that diverges substantially from your career path can feel like a setback, but it can also offer valuable experiences and skills, such as communication and resilience. Only you can decide if those potential benefits outweigh your lack of interest in the role. 2. **Sales Nature**: Door-to-door sales can be challenging and require a particular mindset and skill set, including strong interpersonal skills, resilience in the face of rejection, and a high level of self-motivation.

It's important to weigh financial benefits against personal well-being. If you are living with your parents and don't have immediate financial pressure, you might have the luxury of being more selective about the jobs you take, focusing on those that better align with your career goals in IT. 4. **Future Opportunities**: Leaving a job after one day can be a difficult decision, but it's also important to consider longer-term prospects. Staying in a job that makes you unhappy or doesn't contribute to your career goals could potentially close off other opportunities, especially in your field of interest (IT). 5. **Employer's Reaction**: Depending on the turnover rate and the company's policies, quitting during training might not be as unusual in sales roles, especially door-to-door sales, which have high turnover rates. However, it's always beneficial to leave on good terms if possible, explaining your decision professionally and courteously. 6. **Alternative Plans**: Before making a final decision, consider your next steps. Do you have other job prospects? Are there internships or entry-level positions in IT or a related field that you could pursue? Would dedicating more time to searching for roles more aligned with your degree and interests be feasible? Given your interest in IT and your assessment that the sales job is not a good fit, it may be worth considering quitting the job. However, before doing so, it might be helpful to have a backup plan or at least dedicate your efforts to finding a job that aligns more closely with your career aspirations in IT. Remember, short-term discomfort for long-term gain in a field you are passionate about might be worth considering."},{"instruction":"Write a Phineas and Ferb sequel to Across the 2nd Dimension where Doofenshmirtz accidentally erases 4 universes (Kikoriki, Lamput, BFDI and Horrid Henry) and also the 2nd Dimension begins being erased, only P&F can save the 2nd Dimension), Also Mom finds out about what they've been building (Everyone's minds is erased at the end, just like the first film)","output":"Title: Phineas and Ferb: Across the Multiverse Opening: Our adventure begins in the familiar backyard of Phineas and Ferb. The dynamic duo, alongside their friends, are reminiscing about their previous endeavor in the 2nd Dimension when suddenly Dr. Doofenshmirtz crashes into their backyard. Frantically, he explains that in an attempt to create a \\"Universe-Blendinator\\" aimed at merging the best parts of different universes into his, he accidentally created a device that erases them instead. Chapter 1: The Universe Erasure After a mishap at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., four universes: Kikoriki, Lamput, BFDI (Battle for Dream Island), and Horrid Henry, begin to vanish. As these worlds start fading, characters from these universes find themselves stranded in Danville. Panic ensues as these characters try to adapt to their sudden displacement. Phineas, Ferb, their friends, and the misplaced characters witness the 2nd Dimension beginning to erase as well. A desperate plan is devised to save not only their world but all affected dimensions. Chapter 2: Building the Dimension-Saver Determined to fix Doofenshmirtz's mistake, Phineas and Ferb, along with their interdimensional cohort, begin constructing the \\"Dimension-Saverator.\\" A device capable of restoring the lost universes. They split into teams, each with a critical component to find or build, leading to a series of adventures across remnants of fading worlds. During their quest, Candace finally manages to get Linda (Mom) to see the immense project the boys are working on. In disbelief and astonishment, she confronts Phineas and Ferb. However, seeing the gravity of their mission to save not just their universe but multiple others, she joins their effort, offering her support in this dire situation. Chapter 3: The Revival Mission With the Dimension-Saverator complete, Phineas, Ferb, and their allies embark on a daring mission into the collapsing 2nd Dimension. Inside, they navigate the dissolving reality, facing challenges and adversaries, including a repentant but powerless 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz, who joins them in their quest for redemption. In a climactic moment, Phineas and Ferb activate the Dimension-Saverator at the heart of the erasure. The machine churns to life, radiating a brilliant light that pierces through the darkness of the vanishing dimensions. Chapter 4: Restoration and Reset The mission is a success, but not without consequence. The dimensions are restored, including the 2nd Dimension, and all displaced characters are returned to their rightful worlds. However, the immense energy discharge from the Dimension-Saverator triggers a universal reset. Memories of the event begin to fade among everyone involved, just as they had in their previous adventure across dimensions. In the aftermath, everything returns to normal in Danville. Phineas, Ferb, and their friends find themselves in their backyard, with no memory of the adventure, but a feeling of accomplishment. Dr. Doofenshmirtz, now also oblivious to the events, finds his \\"Universe-Blendinator\\" project scrapped, pondering why he'd ever consider blending universes in the first place. Epilogue: In each restored universe, life goes on as if nothing had happened, with our heroes and their newly-forged interdimensional friendships going back to their daily lives, oblivious to the bonds they had formed. Back in Danville, Linda wonders about the big project she thought she saw in the backyard, but shrugs it off, attributing it to her imagination. And so ends another extraordinary adventure of Phineas and Ferb: Across the Multiverse. With their limitless creativity and a penchant for the impossible, who knows what they'll come up with next? But that's a story for another day.

Unbeknownst to Phineas and Ferb, today will unfold differently from their typical exploits. After yesterday's universe-saving antics, which have been entirely wiped from their memories, the brothers wake up feeling an unusual sense of accomplishment, ready to embark on a new project. Chapter 1: A Day Like No Other Excited and energized, Phineas exclaims, \\"I know what we're going to do today!\\" However, before the boys can set their plan into motion, Candace, fueled by years of unsuccessful attempts to bust her brothers, decides to take her mission to a new level. She installs a complex surveillance system around the backyard to capture undeniable evidence of her brothers' extraordinary projects. Chapter 2: The Ultimate Contraption Unaware of Candace’s plans, Phineas and Ferb, alongside their friends, begin constructing their most ambitious project yet: a massive, multifunctional amusement park that combines elements from all their past creations, a tribute to their summer adventures. The park includes roller coasters, anti-gravity fun houses, and a live concert stage, where Love Händel is scheduled to perform. Chapter 3: Busted As the project nears completion, Candace springs into action, summoning Mom to the backyard with a live video feed at her fingertips. This time, Linda witnesses the boys’ unbelievable creation in its full glory. Overwhelmed by the sight, she finally acknowledges Candace's efforts. Candace, feeling a mix of vindication and worry about her brothers' fate, leads her Mom to the backyard. Simultaneously, the unimaginable happens: an accidental trigger sends the amusement park folding into a compact box with a simple “Return to Sender” label, just seconds before Linda steps into the backyard. However, the undeniable evidence remains on Candace’s video recordings, leaving Linda no choice but to confront the reality of her sons' inventions. Chapter 4: A Twist of Fate As Linda prepares to take action, a familiar yet unexpected event unfolds. The boys, along with their creations, are summoned by an interdimensional agency responsible for maintaining the balance of creativity and order in the universe. The agency reveals that Phineas and Ferb’s inventions have significantly contributed to the stability of multiple dimensions, including saving them from erasure. Faced with the choice of punishing her sons or understanding the grander importance of their actions, Linda experiences a change of heart. Meanwhile, Candace, realizing the potential consequences her brothers face, embarks on a mission to save them. She rallies friends and family, arguing the case that Phineas and Ferb's creativity and good intentions have consistently yielded positive outcomes, even if the immediate results seem chaotic. Chapter 5: Resolution and Redemption Touched by Candace's impassioned defense and the agency's explanation, Linda decides not to punish Phineas and Ferb but instead celebrates their ingenuity and the joy they bring to the world. The interdimensional agency, satisfied with the outcome, decides to leave things be but warns Phineas and Ferb to be more cautious in the future. In a heartwarming conclusion, the family comes together, with Linda and Candace participating in the next day’s project, illustrating the strength of their bond. Candace, now less concerned with busting her brothers and more with cherishing the time they have together, embraces the unpredictable nature of their adventures. Epilogue: As the day winds down, the characters gather at the compacted amusement park box in the backyard, laughing and reminiscing about the day’s events. Linda puts her arm around Candace, acknowledging her dedication and love for her brothers. Phineas looks around, smiles, and says, \\"You know, I think today was pretty okay.\\" The amusement park box, a symbol of their creativity and the adventures still to come, sits quietly among them, hinting at the endless possibilities the future holds.

This malicious software often installs covertly on a victim’s computer, runs a cryptology attack that adversely affects it, and then requires payment from the victim to get a decryption key. Today, there are dozens of ransomware strains. Globally, ransomware continues to be a problem with new families emerging regularly. There are two types of ransomware in circulation. The common type today is crypto ransomware, which aims to encrypt files. The other is locker ransomware, which is designed to lock the computer, preventing victims from using it. In this assessment, we will only consider the crypto ransomware type. Your task is to design a new crypto ransomware based on the Feistel structure, which utilises a product cipher algorithm that combines three of the classical transposition and substitution ciphers. In this task, you will answer several questions that readers might ask about this ransomware: 1. Distribution scheme: Propose a way to distribute your ransomware to potential victims. Explain both the download and execution procedures. (10%) 2. Obfuscation: Propose a way to keep your ransomware hidden during both the infection and operation phases to prevent removal and analysis. Name some tools that allow you to implement your selected way. (10%) 3.

Within the realm of malware proliferation, three predominant channels stand preeminent: phishing [a mode of cyberattack that deceives individuals into divulging personal information by mimicking trusted entities via digital communications (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015)] campaigns, exploit kits, and malvertising [injection of malicious advertisements into legitimate networks, coercing users into downloading ransomware (Kharraz, et al., 2015)] which when coupled with phishing remains as one of the most pervasive vectors for ransomware distribution (Liska & Gallo, 2016). With regards to the ransomware in question, harnessing a synergistic integration of these channels possess the potentiality of markedly enhancing both penetration and efficacy. Leveraging sophisticated social engineering stratagems amidst phishing initiatives is quintessential to the architecture of this distribution methodology (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015). Through the strategic alteration of content hashing, emails ingeniously tailored with precision can surpass spam filtration mechanisms, thus demonstrating the propensity to manipulate recipients into inadvertently installing malware under the guise of attachments that echo ‘authenticity’ (Bertino & Islam, 2017). In conjunction with email marketing mediums such as Mailchimp and MailerLite to name a few, by means of compromised accounts, these services can be seamlessly harnessed to automate and augment the campaign. Concomitantly, exploit kits constitute an equally insidious disbursement vector. These apparatuses, orchestrated to identify and capitalise on frailties present in a victim’s browser or outdated plugins, guarantee the automated propulsion of the ransomware upon engagement with a compromised digital domain (Kotov & Massacci, 2013); exploit kits with Angler and Neutrino being exemplars, are amenable to utilisation, in view of their past adaptations by cybercriminal contingents for equivalent intents (O'Kane, et al., 2018). In the quest for optimising this technique, the adoption of Traffic Distribution Systems [TDS] may considerably expedite the delivery of the exploit kit to those signified by outmoded software repertoire. Obfuscation: The art of concealing the operational and pernicious junctures of crypto ransomware mandates an elaborate obfuscation strategy that affirms robustness in circumventing detection and subsequent scrutiny. Paramount to this strategy is the implementation of advanced obfuscation techniques, which not only just conceal the manifestation of ransomware, however also convolute its attack pattern, making decomposition and mitigation by cybersecurity defences a daunting challenge (You & Yim, 2010). Enacting obfuscation entails a nuanced approach, amalgamating both static [analysing code without requiring the programme to be executed] and dynamic [utilises real-time data for programme evaluation] methodologies to thwart analysis apparatuses and bypass dynamic analysis mechanisms, respectively (You & Yim, 2010). Static Obfuscation: Static obfuscation is proficiently attainable through the application of approaches including code encryption, coupled with the incorporation of remarkably evasive polymorphic malware [adaptively and continually alters its code via encryption (Li, et al., 2011)] and metamorphic malware [completely rewrites its code per cycle without any encryption (Li, et al., 2011)]. These approaches ingeniously modify the ransomware’s signature in successive iterations, all the while without compromising its intrinsic functionality, thereby outmanoeuvring signature-based detection protocols (Szor, 2005). Supplementary code fortification tools like VMProtect and Themida sophisticate code analysis through providing advanced virtualisation and encryption, profoundly hindering reverse engineering and decompilation (Eagle, 2008). Dynamic Obfuscation: The deployment of techniques in dynamic obfuscation, particularly runtime packers in conjunction with the insertion of junk code, considerably amplifies the surreptitious nature of ransomware. The application of these measures dynamically reshapes the code throughout the entirety of its execution, preventing runtime analysis whilst nullifying detection; supplemented with anti-debugging methods that exhibit the latency to counteract forensic and debugging technologies instantaneously- this bolsters this strategy, assuring the malware’s undertakings remain hidden (Udupa, 2005; Mickens, 2011). Command and Control (C&C) Communications: The quintessence of crypto ransomware’s operational versatility is encapsulated within its C&C framework, functioning as the hidden fulcrum for exchanging encrypted directives and key management between the compromised entity and the adversary’s server. This covert conduit, through the use of asymmetric encryption [a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys, public- that partakes in local encryption activities, and private- which is securely transmitted to the C&C server via encrypted channels] (Stallings, 2017)], fortifies the conveyance of the encryption key, indispensable for the cryptography of files, thereby upholding discretion against prospective interception (Paar & Pelzl, 2010; Stallings, 2017; Liska & Gallo, 2016). As cited by (Paar & Pelzl, 2010), this course sets in motion the ransomware generating a distinctive encryption key tailored to the victim’s files, guaranteeing the key’s resilience is impervious to brute-force attacks; a resultant chain of events that inexorably forces victims to disburse a ransom for the restitution of their data follows. To facilitate undetectable communications, this ransomware utilises a technique known as beaconing, whereby it transmits encrypted signals at regular intervals to connect with its C&C server. This method incorporates a Domain Generation Algorithm [/DGA- automatically generates a plethora of domain names that malware can use to establish connections with, command, and control servers], heightening the complexity of either blocking or tracing the server (Atonakakis, et al., 2011; Al-Rimy, et al., 2018). Communications evolve from simple HTTPs to intricate encrypted channels such as Tor/ I2P for key transmission, proficiently obscuring it from network traffic analysis (Huang, et al., 2018). To guarantee resilience confronting disruption, multiple fallback mechanisms are embedded within the ransomware’s architecture, streamlining an incessant reestablishment of severed connections. Furthermore, the C&C infrastructure leverages a decentralised model, diversifying its command vertices whilst significantly obstructing termination efforts by judicial bodies (Mickens, 2011). Each of these carefully crafted strategies are purported to elevate the durability and discreetness of this ransomware campaign, ensuring continuity and elusiveness in its operations. File Selection for Encryption: Leveraging the Feistel cipher framework, this ransomware purports to adopt a multifaceted strategy for the selection & encryption of files, incorporating an extensive assortment of file types essential for individual, and corporate usage (Stallings, 2011). This system proactively scouts for and encrypts files- extending from documents and images to emails and databases- contingent on their corresponding extensions, comprising .docx, .ost, .pdf, .pst, .png, .pst, and .sql, amongst others; thus, securing a comprehensive sweep of both ubiquitous and strategically critical data. Applying a recursive traversal algorithm, it assiduously searches local and networked repositories, effortlessly navigating multitudinous file systems and storage technologies, hence an exhaustive search in ensured by employing superior access rights obtained through exploitation techniques delineated previously (Casey, 2011; Carrier, 2005)- warranting vast ramifications, coercing victims toward ransom demand fulfilment. Analysing Ransomware Security: The advancing convolution of cryptographic ransomware, notably those founded on Feistel cipher architectures, demands thorough security scrutiny to mitigate prevalent cryptographic incursions (Anderson, 2008; Stinson, 2005). This prototype integrates the principles of transportation and substitution amid a Feistel construct, establishing a labyrinthine encryption approach- this resultantly presents considerable obstacles for adversaries seeking to decrypt files, and/ or locate and eradicate the ransomware sans financial indemnity (Bertino & Sandhu, 2005; Ferguson, et al., 2010). Mitigating Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: This cryptographic model employs successive encryption cycles, interweaving transposition and substitution procedures- such recursive profundity in encryption elevates the computational sophistication requisite for decrypting the cipher devoid of comprehension of the key, accordingly, subverting the efficacy of MitM attacks (Diffie & Hellman, 1976). Therefore, the introduction of non-linear constituents into encryption cycles considerably elevates the integrity of the encrypted data, markedly fortifying resistance to differential cryptanalysis by intensifying the complications in forging plaintext and ciphertext pair relational pairings (Biham & Shamir, 1991). Sequentially, the complexity of each cycle’s output heightens, diminishing the chance of discerning intermediate plaintext states imperative in foiling MitM attacks. Bypassing the Pitfalls of Frequency Analysis: Frequency analysis, an acclaimed instrument in cryptanalysis [the study of decrypting cryptographic systems (Stinson, 2005)] in the face of basic substitution ciphers, encounters a pronounced decline in effectiveness against the multifaceted encryption system of this ransomware in question. The employment of elaborate substitution algorithms, whose variations are iteratively administered throughout encryption sequences, substantially confounds frequency analysis activities. Concurrently, the sporadic variation of key schedules efficiently neutralises the dangers presented by conventional frequency-dependent cryptanalysis practices (Matsui, 1993). Characteristically, the Feistel structure systematically transmutes character frequency distributions across its encryption cycles, masterfully obsoleting frequency analysis for cipher deconstruction (Sinkov & Feil, 2009). Moreover, the presence of polyalphabetic components unremittingly modulates the substitution protocol, consequently corroding frequency analysis initiatives (Singh, 1999). Countermeasures for Brute Force Attacks: Feistel-centric architectures, with their dependency on extensive keys of variable length, inherently possess vigorous defensive measures to combat brute force attacks (Stinson, 2005). The calculated execution of key expansion strategies, by which short keys are methodologically elongated to more intricate, lengthier variants, calls for an exponentially greater computational exertion for brute force deciphering, accordingly, ingeniously enlisting time an ally against any unsanctioned decryption efforts (Hellman, 1980). This defence is fortified by an immense key space, via synthesising multiple conventional ciphers, rendering the notion of a meticulous key search ineffective within any feasible timeframe, consequently affording preservation against brute force attacks. Moreover, the implementation of a versatile key generation model, distinctively allocating keys for individual scenarios, adds a layer of convolutedness- subsequently thwarting brute force attack attempts (Schneier, 1996; Katz & Lindell, 2014). Counteractive Measures for Decryption and Detection: Decryption endeavours, absent the direct procurement of the corresponding decryption key is profoundly taxing due to the aforementioned cryptographic hindrances. Refined obfuscation manoeuvres, conjoined with the core complexities of encryption, not only obfuscate the decryption endeavours, but also mask the ransomware from signature-oriented detection algorithms, thereby fostering a stratified and multi-layered defence schema (You & Yim, 2010). Nevertheless, one cannot afford to ignore conceivable theoretical susceptibilities regarding cryptanalysis; the domain of cryptographic attacks is in perpetual flux, demanding sustained observances and optimisations to the encryption framework applied by the ransomware. In the realm of identifying ransomware, elaborate obfuscation alongside C&C communicative strategies elucidated herein serve to impede conventional heuristic and signature-based technologies (Ucci, et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the utilisation of sophisticated behavioural analysis instrumentation, monitoring system operations for deviations indicative of ransomware, yield a tangible method for discernment and deterrence without acceding to monetary demands. The engagement of decentralised machine learning-oriented models demonstrates the potential to distinguish the nuanced behavioural modalities of ransomware operations, promoting an anticipatory security stance (Apruzzese, et al., 2018). Preventative Actions Against Reverse Engineering: Warding off reverse engineering pursuits- imperative for the exposure and comprehension of the inner machinations of the ransomware- as formerly noted calls for the strategic usage of obfuscation techniques. Harnessing the prowess of refined software protection tools [take Enigma Protector and Code Virtualizer as exemplars], they metamorphose plain code into a confounding conundrum, vastly inhibiting the reverse engineering process, at the same time as consolidating the safeguarding measures, resultantly heightening the insurmountable hurdle for adversaries in pursuit of counteracting the ransomware devoid of unobstructed accessibility of the decryption key (Votipka, et al., 2018). This strategy adeptly shrouds logical patterns in secrecy whilst drastically augmenting the difficulty quotient and minimising the success threshold for cyber defence bodies endeavouring to crack and/ or invalidate the ransomware without complying to ransom payment (Megira, et al., 2018; Zander, et al., 2007). With the objective of bolstering resistance in opposition to reverse engineering, the synergistic melding of dynamic code analysis with runtime packers and polymorphism, all collectively infuse an additional stratum of complexity- a modification of which renders static analysis endeavours ineffective. Integrating anti-debugging measures is of paramount criticality in complicating the reverse engineering trajectory, hence fortifying defences against direct decryption or disassembly attempts without the designated key (Eagle, 2014).\\".","output":"Given the constraints of this task to discuss the payment process of a theoretically designed ransomware operation, it is crucial to recognize this endeavor purely as a hypothetical exercise, meant for educational purposes only, underpinned by ethical considerations and disclaimers against the misuse of this knowledge. The devised ransomware's payment mechanism is engineered to underscore anonymity, security, and untraceability. Victims are guided through a meticulously crafted multi-step process, beginning with a notification screen displaying a customized ransom demand based on the assessed value of encrypted data. This notification redirects victims to an anonymized payment portal accessible only via Tor, to bolster confidentiality and impede tracking efforts. Payments are exclusively transacted in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Monero among the preferred, due to their widespread acceptance and varying degrees of anonymity, respectively (Moore & Rid, 2016; Soska & Christin, 2015). This cryptocurrency mandate not only complicates the identification of beneficiaries but also muddles the reversal of transactions, an inherent characteristic of blockchain technology (Narayanan et al., 2016). Upon payment submission, a unique identifier is dispatched to victims to validate the transaction within the blockchain. Post-verification, the decryption key is automatically released through a secure channel, enabling victims to commence data retrieval. Crucially, this system incorporates a countdown mechanism to instill urgency, post which, data permanency is guaranteed through the deletion of decryption keys from the server (Huang et al., 2018). This payment modality, while ensuring a layer of safety for the perpetrators against legal pursuits and traceability, plunges victims into a quagmire of ethical and logistical predicaments, compelling them to finance illicit activities potentially thereby perpetuating the ransomware economy.

Magnum Caelum Imperium] ruling [Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium] over [which territories Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium controlled] the Milky Way galaxy from [which series Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium is from] Star Wars, [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium] replacing [which faction Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium replaces] the ecumene from [which series the ecumine is from] Halo, a technologically advanced post-singularity technocratic aristocratic galactic hyperpower [the ecumine] that [the ecumine] was [what type of state the ecumine was] a constitutional democratic absolute monarchy [the ecumine] that [the ecumine] stretched across the Milky Way and [the ecumine] was [what happened to the ecumine] ruled by [who ruled the ecumine] Primoris prognatus [Forerunners |Primoris prognatus|], who [Primoris prognatus] were [what Primoris prognatus were] an ancient species [Primoris prognatus] of [what Primoris prognatus were |Primoris prognatus| an ancient species |Primoris prognatus| of] extremely technologically advanced, psychically and magically gifted, hyper-intelligent humanoid beings [Primoris prognatus] as [what Primoris prognatus ruled the ecumine as] its [the ecumine's] dominant race before the end of their [Primoris prognatus'] empire [the ecumine] in [when the ecumine ended] pre-AD times, the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's birth, rise and [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's] subsequent establishment and [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's] growth into the Galaxy's hyperpower [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's current state] starting [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's rise to power and dominance |the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku| of the Milky Way] in the earlier stages of the latter's [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] fall and [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] eventual subsquent dissolution. The Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium has its [the Primum Magnum Caelum Imperium's] canon civilian and military technologies with the Star Wars humans having the same psychic and magical powers and hyper-intelligence as the Primoris prognatus in canon Halo in addition to the Primoris prognatus' canon civilian and military technologies and the same being true for the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku and the Covenant. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also replaces the galaxy-spanning paramilitary force/meritocratic military organization/pirate guild lead by the infamous race of horned extraterrestrial warmongers known as the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z], the Planetary Trade Organization [Dragon Ball Z] in this fic, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku in this fic] also having the PTO's technology, weapons and equipment, with the Juraians [Tenchi Muyo], a humanoid extraterrestrial race [the Jurians] of psychics and magic users good at electronics and mechanics [the Jurians], who [the Juraians] are the ruling caste and the dominant force in the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku's politics, royalty and aristocracy [the Juraians] replacing the Frost Demons [Dragon Ball Z] and [the Jurians] also having the Frost Demons' swordsmanships and qi/ki manipulation abilities in addition to their [the Juraians'] own canonical abilities and skills, [the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku replacing the PTO and the Jurians replacing the Frost Demons in this fic] thus making them [the Juraians in this story] the masters [the Juraians in this story] of the naturally aggressive warrior race descended from Great Apes who gained intelligence and took on a humanoid form who, since ancient times, have lived a violent and inhumane lifestyle, where they attack numerous planets to build up wealth and goods, the Saiyans [Dragon Ball Z], [the Juraians being the masters of the Saiyans in this fic] and [the Juraians in this fic] using the Saiyans to conquer and clean out multiple planets not just across the Milky Way, but across the various galaxies for them [the Juraians in this fic]. The Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku also maintains control of the Jikū Kanri Kyoku [Time-Space Administrative Bureau |Jikū Kanri Kyoku|], an interdimensional security force [Jikū Kanri Kyoku] and full-out military force [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] formed [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] jointly by a union of several worlds that [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] also monitors cultural growth and provides disaster relief to each world under the JKK's jurisdiction especially when it involves magic and the magical items of tremendous power that are legacies of collapsed civilizations known as Lost Logia [Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha] , [the Jikū Kanri Kyoku] from Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha in this story. The descendant of low-class warrior Saiyans imprinted with only enough training to fight and conquer, Kakkarot [Dragon Ball franchise] is [Kakkarot] still [Kakkarot] sent to Earth to [Kakkarot] conquer it [Earth] sometime in the 500 AD period of human history as a baby, [Kakkarot] being [Kakkarot] adopted by Grandpa Gohan [Dragon Ball] after his [Kakkarot's] spaceship crashlanded on a hyperadvanced, semi-spacefaring version of ancient Earth, more specifically in the Han Chinese Imperial House of Yang-ruled Great Sui State/Sui dynasty ruling over Han China and [Kakkarot] being given the Chinese name of 'Sun Wukong' by Grandpa Gohan. After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs [Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z] and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled absolute imperial dynastic monarchy of the Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 21th century via [Wukong] taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, [Trunks's descendants] subsequently being absorbed into the Japanese as the centuries go on. Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire is [the Japanese Empire in this fic] restored [the Japanese Empire in this fanfic] as the government [the Japanese Empire] of Japan after the series of natural disasters, continent-wide wars and nuclear exchanges resulting in flames exploding around the world, devastating it [Earth] and leaving most parts of the planet uninhabitable, with continents being torn apart and some nations being utterly obliterated known as the Great Cataclysm [Fire Force], which [the Great Cataclysm in this story] is [the Great Cataclysm in this story] the same even as the global intercontinental military conflict and power bloc war within the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe that lasted from 2045 to 2064 and started as a result of a military conflict between the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled unitary presidential republic of the Russian Federation ruling over Siberia and the Russian Far East from Russia and the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Greater Manchuria over immigration due to global cooling starting around 2030 which was already worsened by advanced agricultural production becoming a solar-powered industry in 2020, leading to a temporary population boom [the conflict which lasted from 2045 to 2064 in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe] known as the Third World War [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] and the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], [the Third World War in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe being the same as the Great Cataclysm from Fire Force and the Invertia from Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku in this story] with the ancient clan of extra-terrestial horned humanoid creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] descended [ the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this fic] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke [Tenchi Muyo!] [this fic's Masaki dynasty-descended version of the Ōtsutsuki clan] acting as this neo-Japanese Empire's imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] fleeing [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] from the hidden-from the rest of the world, mythical, stuck on the feudal era of Japanese and the Ming and Song dynasty era of Chinese history politically, socially and economically, having the mythical combination of ki/qi and spiritual energy known as chakra-using fake shinobi and wuxia style cultivator mega continent known as the Elemental Nations [Naruto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] setting in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] being [what happened to the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] mistaken for [what the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic were |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| mistaken |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| for] the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, the real-life Japanese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato] by [who mistook the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the Imperial House of Great Yamato] the residents of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, this mistake [the residents of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto mistaking the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the surviving remnants of Imperial House of Great Yamato left in post-Great Cataclysm Japan] allowing it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] to [the Ōtsutsuki clan this fanfic] rebuild its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's in this fanfic's] new home [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] use it [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] as a base [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] for the eventual annhilation, conquest, absorption and assmilation of the myriad warlord states, bandit hideouts and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm, [the assimilation of the myriad of warlord states, bandit fiefdoms and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm by the fortified, rebuilt, restructured and rejuvinated post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] ending with the conquest and subsequent assmilation of the de-jure constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy but de facto theocratic industrial theocratic city state of the Raffles-dynasty ruled Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in post-Great Cataclysm Tokyo into the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule, which [the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] marked the reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule and the end of the post-Great Cataclysm warlord era in Japan. The creatures of Grimm [human and supernatural eating carnivorous monsters |Grimm| that |Grimm| do not |what the Grimm do not have| possess a soul, |the Grimm| being |what happens to the Grimm| drawn towards |what attracts the Grimms’ presence| negative emotions such as jealously, grief, loneliness, hatred and fear, |the Grimms’ attraction to negativity| causing them |the Grimms| to often congregate on the source of these emotions, |the Grimm| attacking any humans and supernatural creatures they |the Grimm| encounter on sight, |the Grimm| from |the media franchise the Grimm are (the Grimm) from| RWBY] also emerge after the Great Cataclysm all over the world along with the Infernals [former humans that spontaneous combust and |the Infernals| become |what the Infernals become after spontaneous combustion| misshapen fiery charcoal-like monsters, the Infernals being |what the Infernals are| a common feature and |the Infernals| a ever-present threat |the Infernals| in the post-Great Catalclysm world, |the Infernals| being |the Infernals| from |the franchise the Infernals are (the Infernals) from Fire Force] and the Gastrea [deadly parasites |Gastrea| that |Gastrea| transform |who Gastrea transform| their |the Gastrea’s| victims into |what the Gastrea transform their (the Gastrea’s victims) into mutated, superhuman, human-eating, powerful monsters (the endstage of a Gastrea infection), |the Gastrea| from |the media franchise the Gastrea are (the Gastrea) from| Black Bullet] Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. The reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule allows for the quick reconstruction and rebuilding of the country [Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule] and pre-Great Cataclysm luxuries such as electricity, bullet trains, the internet and running water soon return to Japan due to the merger of the Great Tokyo Empire's steampunk and dieselpunk technology with the advanced extraterrestrial technology and industry from brought from Jurai and the surviving pre- Great Cataclysm Japanese, American and even Russian technology left behind. In fact, the seizure of the unimaginably powerful flame or energy that be used to bring both creation and destruction, not connected to the physical laws of Earth but connected to collective minds, emotions, and perceptions of humanity known as the Adolla Burst [Fire Force]-powered infinite energy providing thermal-powered generator located in the Central Ward of the Tokyo Empire, the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" [Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \\"Amaterasu\\" |Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"|] from [the media franchise the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" is |the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"| from] Fire Force, [the seizure of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] during the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule is what will prove useful in the stability of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire. The Ōtsutsuki soon discover the presence of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, very manipulative, volatile and misanthropic nature Adolla Burst having survivor of the Great Cataclysm known only as Amaterasu [Fire Force] inside the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" after the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule and [the Ōtsutsuki] quickly rescue Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\", [ The Ōtsutsuki rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] copying her [Amaterasu's] Adolla Burst and placing the copy [of Amaterasu's Adolla Burst] inside the the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" to power it [ the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] while [The Ōtsutsuki after |The Ōtsutsuki| rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] scanning her [Amaterasu's] memories and [The Ōtsutsuki] discovering the presence of the extraterrestrial god-like entity with immense reality warping powers known only as the Evangelist [Fire Force] and its [the Evangelist's] cult organization with the goal of recreating the Great Cataclysm, the White Clad [Fire Force] within the Great Tokyo Empire's territories. The Ōtsutsuki soon begin constructions of replicas of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" all through post-Great Cataclysm Japan. Japan's Bicameral national legislature with the ability to pass laws and also to nominate the Japanese prime minister, consisting of a lower house, called the House of Representatives and an upper house, the House of Councillors, which [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] are [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] directly elected under a parallel voting system, the National Diet, [the National Diet] also resumes operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. In fact the bill that restores the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is passed through the National Diet. Japan’s central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system responsible for supervising Japan’s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters, under the Japanese Cabinet Office commission responsible for guaranteeing the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration, the National Public Safety Commission of the Japanese Cabinet Office, the Japanese National Police Agency, the elite tactical unit equivalent to the US Delta Force/US CIA SOG black ops death squads of the Japanese police force maintained by individual Japanese prefectural police forces and supervised by the Japanese National Police Agency and also national-level counterterrorism unit that cooperates with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads, the Special Assault Team, post-WW2's Japan's domestic intelligence agency administered by the Japanese Ministry of Justice tasked with internal security and espionage against threats to Japanese national security, contributing to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations, the Public Security Intelligence Agency and the post-WW2 Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet, reporting directly to the Japanese Prime Minister, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, [the Japanese NPA, the SAT, PISA and CIRO] soon resume their [the Japanese NPA's, the SAT's, PISA's and CIRO's] respective operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] along with the JSDF's special forces unit with a mission of infiltration into enemy territory, reconnaissance, sabotage, and hostage rescue, and conducting military operations against guerrillas or enemy commandos during wartime, the Special Forces Group, [the JSDF and SFG] also return to full operational capacity after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. SOG and SAT teams accompanied by PIRO agents with support given by CIRO under the direct supervision of the National Diet then begin covert operations against the White Clad in the Great Tokyo Empire's former territories, with White Clad members being captured in these operations being taken to black sites for processing and interrogation. Seperate teams of JSDF soliders and SOG agents along with SAT teams also begin Grimm [RWBY] and Infernal [Fire Force] extermination work within Japan. The Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], [the Tokkō] also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's combined military forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, [the IJAF] also make a return after the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, with the JSDF being reduced to a defence force. After the restoration of the IJAF in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, special influence is placed on the reconstruction of the Japanese Empire’s ground combat force and the land warfare division of the IJAF, the Imperial Japanese Army as a professional, well-trained army [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJA] living up to the best standards of the pre-Great Cataclysm world. the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The IJAF's elite Japanese special forces/airborne unit, the Teishin Shudan [Raiding Group |Teishin Shudan|], [the Teishin Shudan] is [the Teishin Shudan] also restored [the Teishin Shudan] after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [magnificent lineage |Kazoku|] is [the Kazoku] also restored [the Kazoku] in Japan the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The restoration of the imperial system [the Japanese Empire] in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] heavily influenced [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] by the pre-1868 Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial dynastic constitutional parliamentary monarchy but de facto feudal dynastic hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the heads of the Tokugawa clan being [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] restored [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] to their [the heads of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chiefs of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, |sei-i taishōgun| abbreviated |sei-i taishōgun| and more popularly known as shogun, |sei-i taishōgun| the hereditary military rulers |the sei-i taishōgun| of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868, |the sei-i taishōgun| having civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority]. The restored Tokugawa shoguns have a position more akin to that of the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the Germanic Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors] in days gone past however. The collection of various powers that supported the various shogunates of Japanese history and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the samurai] also make a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Thus, the restored Japanese Empire ruling over post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is formally known as the Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta [the Empire of Great Japan under the Tokugawa Tent Government |Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta|] or simply the Teikoku Bakufu [Imperial Shogunate |Teikoku Bakufu|]. After rebuilding its [Japan's] sociopolitical, military and governmental institutions and [Japan] restructuring itself, post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule seeks to reclaim all of the territories outside of the Japanese Home Islands that were once ruled by the Japanese Empire before 1947: mainly the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule first starts with Korea, which [Korea] is [Korea] in a state of chaos, disarray and confusion after the joint collapse of the Soviet satellite and later on post-Soviet Russia dictatorship of the Korean nationalist, Korean supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist Worker's Party of Korea-ruled totalitarian communist dictatorship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and the unitary presidential republic Republic of Korea occupying South Korea in the wake of the Great Cataclysm. The restored IJAF and buke quickly invades post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea and [The restored IJAF and buke] seize the area [post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea ] with ease, [The restored IJAF and buke during the invasion of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea] putting down Korean bandit and terrorist groups along with crime gangs and anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the ROKAF's strategic-level military command responsible for its [the ROKAF's] special operations forces, its members receiving special training for various unconventional warfare missions and whose primary tasks include guerrilla warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, direct action, collecting information in enemy territory and carrying out special missions including assassination, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command [ROKASWC] along with anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's primary domestic law enforcement agency run under the ROK's Ministry of the Interior and Safety, divided into 18 local police agencies and having local police forces within the ROK under its command, the Korean National Police Agency, the KNPA's specialized Police tactical unit trained to perform dangerous operations whose main mission is counter-terrorism, but it also can include serving high-risk arrest warrants, performing hostage rescue and/or armed intervention, and engaging heavily armed criminals, the SOU [Special Operations Unit] and the ROK's chief intelligence agency and secret police agency, having the responsibility to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the ROK's military along with the additional duties of collecting, coordinating, and distributing information on the ROK's strategy and security, the maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation's classified information, investigation of crimes affecting national security within the ROK, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law, investigation of crimes related to the missions of its staff, along with planning and coordination of information and classified, the National Intelligence Service. The remaining usable elements of the ROKAF and ROKASWC are absorbed into the JSDF and the SOG and the restored IJAF and the TS respectively with the same happening to the KNPA and the SOU with the Japanese NPA and SAT. The remaining usable elements of the NIS are also absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The surviving descendants of the pre-1910 indigenous Korean, slave-owning, sex-slave owning, backward, afraid of progress, Han China worshipping, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility who had immense influence in the post-1392 and pre-1898, Han-Chinese/Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled, backward, out of touch Ming and Qing tributary state of the feudal absolute dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Joeson State/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Joeson Kingdom/Joeson, the yangaban are [the yangaban descendants] suppressed [the yangaban descendants] by the restored IJAF and buke along with anti-Japanese, pro-Korean unification elements in post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The PSIA and CIRO launch a campaign in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea to identify and remove anti-Japanese elements, yangaban descendants and pro-Korean unification elements among the South Korean populace while also running a propaganda campaign that states that the return of Japan to the Korean peninsula after the Great Cataclysm and subsequent collapse of both the ROK and DPRK is a necessary measure for the salvation of the Japanese people. JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands pour into Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea in order to carry out disaster relief work and reconstruction efforts in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The Japanese NPA also starts taking over former KNPA stations and [the Japanese NPA] training new officers in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while also building new stations, with the SAT doing the same. The JSDF takes control of Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea from the restored IJAF and [the JSDF] starts taking over former ROKAF bases and US military bases located in South Korea, and [the JSDF] also begins constructing new bases in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while training and recruiting new servicemen. After the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea, the restored IJAF and buke then assault the former DPRK territory in North Korea from the DMZ border, [the restored IJAF and buke] seizing the former DRPK territory in North Korea with ease due to the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA performing military, political, and psychological operations, to create a \\"second front\\" in the enemy's rear area, and to conduct battlefield and strategic reconnaissance during open war, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ, the DPRK's domestic law enforcement agency in charge of the DPRK's police system along with operating the prison system in the DPRK, monitoring the public distribution system and providing bodyguards to important persons, the Ministry of Social Security, along with the DPRK's paramilitary force subordinate to the ministry which performs various internal security and border security tasks within the DPRK while being in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities, being the DPRK's combined national gendarmerie and civil defense organization organized in military lines, the Social Security Forces [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS, the RGB and the SSF] essentially being [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] unable to [the KPA, KPASOF, the MSS [State and Social] and the RGB] control the DPRK's population after the Great Cataclysm and [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] essentially unable to hold off the Japanese invaders. After the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the restored Japanese Empire takes steps to reintergrate the people of both North and South Korea into Japan. The usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF are [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] absorbed [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] into the restored IJAF, JSDF, SOG and the TS respectively after the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, with the same happening to the MSS [Social] and the Japanese NPA and the SSF and the SAT. The usable elements of the RGB are absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The concentration camps within the DPRK's territory once ran by the Ministry of State Security are dissolved by the restored IJAF and buke and the political prisoners in these concentration camps freed. Like in South Korea, the PSIA and CIRO both run a propaganda campaign while JSDF troops pour into the former DPRK from the Japanese Home Islands, doing disaster relief and reconstruction efforts while putting down Russian loyalists and remnants of the WPK and former DPRK government in South Korea. The JSDF also takes over former KPA bases in the former DPRK and [the JSDF] begins constructing new bases in the former DPRK, [the JSDF] training ethnic North Korean recruits. The Japanese NPA also takes over police stations formerly run by the Ministry of Social Security and begins constructing new ones. After the conquest of both post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK North Korea and post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen as the government [Chōsen] of the entire Korean peninsula. Sometime after the reconquest of Korea and the restoration of Chōsen as its [ post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK and post ROK Korea's] government, the Japanese then turn their [the Japanese's] attention to the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands which they [the Japanese] conquer with ease. The post-1907, pre-1947 Japanese province of Karufuto is [Karufuto] restored [Karufuto] as the government [Karufuto] of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands after their [the Sakhalin's and Kuril Islands's] joint reconquest by the Japanese. After the reconquest of Korea, the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, Japan turns its [Japan's] attention towards Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, which [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] have [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] been [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] in chaos ever since the fall of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China which [Nationalist China] had [Nationalist China] been in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1949 after the latter [the KMT and Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War of 1947-1949 to [the political party and geopolitical entity the KMT and Nationalist China jointly lost the Chinese Civil War to] the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Manchuria, [the collapse of Nationalist China in exile in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1947] as a result of the Great Cataclysm. The Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies/criminal organizations known as the Triads taking up residence in post-Great Cataclysm, post-KMT and Nationalist China Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with the post-Great Cataclysm surviving renmants of the ROCAF's elite special forces unit tasked with carring out special operations, including decaptation strikes in the events of a war, the Airborne Special Service Company, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency which [the Nationalist Chinese NPA] falls under the Nationalist Chinese Ministry of the Interior and [the NPA] oversees all all police forces within National China on a national level, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency's specialist unit and highly trained police tactical unit conducting high-risk arrests and other dangerous law enforcement duties, the Thunder Squad along with Nationalist China's principal intelligence agency created to supervise and coordinate all security-related administrative organizations, military agencies and KMT organizations in Taiwan, gathering, International intelligence, Intelligence within the area of People's Republic of China, Intelligence within the area of Taiwan, Analysis of the nation's strategic intelligence, , Scientific and technological intelligence and telecommunications security, Control and development of secret codes (the matrix) and facilities, Armed Forces Internet Security while also taking charge of planning special tasks and is responsible for guiding, coordinating, and supporting the intelligence affairs in military and civil categories in addition to managing intelligence relevant to national security, the National Security Bureau are no match for the restored IJAF and buke and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] quickly reintergated [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese imperial fold. The usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC are [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] quickly integrated [the usable elements of the ROCAF and the ASSC] into the restored IJAF and the JSDF along with the restored TS and the SOG with the useable elements of the Nationalist Chinese NPA and Thunder Squad being absorbed into the Japanese NPA and Thunder Squad. The usable elements of the NSB are [the usable elements of the NSB] absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. Like in the Korean peninsula, JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands come down to Taiwan to engage in disaster relief and reconstruction and rebuilding work, while [the JSDF] taking over former US military bases and former ROCAF bases in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and [the JSDF] constructing new bases [in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. After the reconquest of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Japanese take special measures to reintergrate the majority population in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and also the main indigenous group in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands the Taiwan-based sub-branch of the Han Chinese subgroup who speak Hokkien and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo Taiwanese along with the other indigenous groups in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese social, political and economic structure. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the large, powerful villain organization turned secret society and paramilitary underworld group that follows the philosophy that the free usage of Quirks is a basic human right, emphasizing liberation over-regulation [of Quirks], the Inō Kaihō-gun [Meta Liberation Army |Inō Kaihō-gun|] from [the media franchise the Inō Kaihō-gun is |the Inō Kaihō-gun| from] Boku no Hero Academia and its [the IKG's] Quirk supremacist agenda are [the IKG and its Quirk supremacist agenda] quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] , in which individuals who are licensed to use their Quirks to protect civilians from Villains, natural disasters, and/or any other kind of harm as a profession, [the Hero System] never takes off in Japan, with the Butei [Armed Detective |Butei|] system of [what the Butei is] national qualification which [the Butei system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Butei to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Butei] have an Butei license, [the Butei system] from [the media franchise the Butei system is from] Hidan no Aria, which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinitely suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Butei System] instead being revived [the Butei System]

other through natural means known as Quirks [Boku no Hero Academia], the pyrokinetic known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the Divas [another

The reemergence of magic, albeit in a form polished through advances in modern technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] occurs at the same time as the emergence of Generations [Fire Force] and the reemergence of Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors after the Great Cataclysm in this story. Quirk users are in fact a sub-set of the sub-branch of the human species born from the etherous element that reacts to the will of those that have fulfilled certain requirements, linking with the elements in the surroundings to change into phenomenon and materials known as mana [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], overturning previous common sense with their enhanced physical ability along with an aura known as prana known as Genestellar [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] who [the Genestellar] are [the Genestellar] divided [the Genestellar] into Strega [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] if female and Dante [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] if male in this story.

The Ōtsutsuki clan, having arrived from a realm long hidden from the eyes of post-Great Cataclysm Earth, found themselves in the ruins of what was once Kyoto. Their arrival, shrouded in the mystique of their ancient lineage and otherworldly presence, was like a beacon in the dark to the weary survivors of this new Earth. Mori, a historian who had devoted his life to preserving the knowledge of the world before the cataclysm, stumbled upon the Ōtsutsuki as they navigated the new landscape. He observed their peculiar abilities with a mix of awe and dread. \\"These beings,\\" Mori mused, witnessing their manipulation of chakra in ways he had never seen, \\"they possess knowledge beyond our understanding. Could they be the key to our salvation, or harbingers of further destruction?\\" The Ōtsutsuki, led by a wise but cautious elder named Kazuki, were aware of the delicate balance they must maintain in this new world. \\"We did not choose this path,\\" Kazuki explained to his clan, \\"but fate has brought us here. Let us use our gifts to heal this land, not conquer it. We must blend our wisdom with the ways of this world.\\" Their advanced understanding of chakra and technology from Jurai caught the attention of the remnants of Kyoto's governance. The local leaders, desperate for stability and protection, saw in the Ōtsutsuki the image of divine protectors. Misinterpreting the clan's true origin, they believed the Ōtsutsuki to be the descendants of the lost Imperial House of Great Yamato. Akihiro, the head of the local JSDF remnant unit, approached Kazuki with both reverence and a proposal. \\"Your arrival has brought us hope,\\" he said, bowing deeply. \\"Kyoto believes you are the returned Imperial family, destined to lead us into a new era. Will you help us restore order and rebuild our society?\\" Kazuki met Akihiro's gaze, understanding the weight of his words. \\"While we are not who you think we are, we share your desire for peace and renewal. Let us work together, combining our strengths to guide Kyoto back to its former glory.\\" As the Ōtsutsuki clan settled into their new role, they leveraged their unique abilities to bring a semblance of order to the chaos. Using the Byakugan, they uncovered hidden resources and remnants of advanced technology buried beneath the city. With the Shikotsumyaku, they repaired and reinforced structures, making them more resilient than ever before. Mori, now an advisor to the clan, helped bridge the gap between the old and the new. \\"We are witnessing the birth of a new civilization,\\" he said, documenting the unfolding events. \\"A fusion of magic and technology, guided by beings of immense power and wisdom.\\" The Ōtsutsuki, while maintaining their mysterious aura, worked tirelessly to foster a sense of community and shared purpose. They trained the JSDF remnants in the art of chakra, blending it with conventional military tactics to protect the city from rogue bandits and remnants of fallen states. As the years passed, Kyoto transformed from a city of ruins to a beacon of hope. The Ōtsutsuki's influence spread, their teachings and technologies laying the foundation for a new era. Yet, Kazuki remained vigilant, aware that the true test of their legacy would be in how they balanced power with compassion, technology with spirituality, and leadership with humility. \\"Let this be our covenant,\\" Kazuki proclaimed, overlooking the rejuvenated city. \\"To safeguard this world from the shadows, guiding it towards a future where peace and prosperity reign. We are not its rulers, but its custodians.\\" Thus, in a world torn apart by catastrophe and conflict, the Ōtsutsuki clan, through a twist of fate, became the architects of a new civilization, blending the past and the future into a present that held promise for all. And in the heart of the bustling, reborn Kyoto, Mori's chronicles of this era would serve as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, forever entwined with the mysterious guardians who had come from beyond the stars to light the way forward."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an dialogue-filled, exposition-filled excerpt of a post-apocalyptic, science fantasy, science fiction, cyberpunk with elements of steampunk and dieselpunk, Japanese science fiction light novel, manga, anime and video game from the 1960s-mid 2010s style, Fist of the North Star post-apocalyptic urban fantasy style award-winning, well-written novel that takes place within the world of the crossover fanfic prompted and generated within the previous entry, focusing on how the Ōtsutsuki clan arrived in post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto from the Elemental Nations and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently [the Ōtsutsuki clan] set up shop there [post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto] and how it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] was able to bring over advanced civilian, military, industrial and even starship technology from the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku [Tenchi Muyo/Tenchi Universe] that had previously been kept in the Elemental Nations [Naruto franchise] to its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] new home [post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto] and how its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] immense psychic and [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] magical powers along with the power of the Byakugan [Naruto franchise] helped it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] quickly decimate a few Yakuza clans, Cantonese-Han Chinese triad cells and other criminal organizations working in post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently become a major, through hidden power [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in the city [post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto] before [the Ōtsutsuki clan] taking over the Kyoto Imperial Palace and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] making it [the Kyoto Imperial Palace] into its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] new clan compound.","output":"Chapter 5: The Legacy of Jurai in Kyoto The streets of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto were a stark contrast to the once vibrant city filled with history and culture. Now, they served as a battleground for survival amidst the ruins. Within this chaotic new world, the arrival of the Ōtsutsuki clan, with their otherworldly powers and advanced technology, marked the beginning of a new era. Mori, the historian who had chronicled their advent, sat across from Kazuki, the clan's elder, in a makeshift room illuminated by a salvaged Jurai technology lamp. Kazuki began, his voice a calm presence in the uncertainty that surrounded them. \\"Our journey here was not by choice but by necessity. Our homeland, the Elemental Nations, had long been protected by our abilities and the technologies we safeguarded from the Jurai Empire.\\" Mori, eager to document this pivotal moment, interjected, \\"And how were you able to bring these technologies with you to Earth?\\" \\"With the Byakugan's foresight, we discovered interdimensional points of weaknesses,\\" Kazuki explained. \\"Combining that knowledge with Jurai's starship technology, we were able to create a vessel capable of crossing dimensions. It was a perilous journey, but our understanding of chakra and the advanced technology at our disposal ensured our survival.\\" The historian was astounded. \\"Such a feat would explain the rapid changes that have occurred since your arrival. Your technology has transformed Kyoto in ways we never imagined possible.\\" Kazuki nodded. \\"Upon arriving, we encountered hostility, not from the land, but from those who sought control in these desperate times. Yakuza clans, Triad cells, and other criminal factions preyed on the weak.\\" Mori, aware of these dark aspects of Kyoto's new order, pressed on. \\"How did you manage to subdue such widespread lawlessness?\\" \\"Our approach was twofold,\\" Kazuki revealed. \\"Firstly, our Byakugan allowed us to dismantle their operations from the shadows. We could see through their hideouts, anticipate their moves, and neutralize their threats without direct confrontation. Meanwhile, our psychic and magical powers, along with Jurai's military technology, were deployed with surgical precision against those who dared challenge the peace we vowed to protect.\\" Mori scribbled furiously, the glow from the lamp casting deep shadows on his face. \\"And the Kyoto Imperial Palace... How did it become your clan's compound?\\" Kazuki gazed out of the window, where the Imperial Palace stood, a symbol of the old world now serving as a beacon of hope. \\"The Palace was a strategic choice. It’s historically revered, a symbol of unity and strength. Our intention was never to usurp its legacy but to preserve it. By establishing our base there, we signaled our commitment to safeguard Kyoto’s heritage and its future.\\" The historian paused, contemplating the gravity of Kazuki's words. \\"Your influence in Kyoto is undeniable. Yet, you've chosen to remain in the shadows, a hidden power guiding the city.\\" \\"The path to true peace and prosperity is gradual,\\" Kazuki said, his eyes reflecting a vision only those with the Byakugan could see. \\"Our aim is not to rule over this city but to empower its people. With the technologies and powers we possess, we have the ability to rebuild, not just Kyoto, but the entire world.\\" Mori set his pen down, realizing the enormity of the tale he was documenting. Before him sat not conquerors, but protectors, wielding their extraordinary powers to forge a new destiny from the ashes of the old world. As the light from the lamp flickered, casting an ethereal glow over the room, the silhouette of Kyoto Imperial Palace stood tall in the background. It was a constant reminder of the past's endurance and the future's promise, now intertwined with the legacy of the Ōtsutsuki clan and the ancient Empire of Jurai."},{"instruction":"the job involves driving around and knocking on people’s doors to sell home security… I wasn’t interested in sales…I only took this job because I needed a job in general…never mind some positives of learning to be more social with customers on the job… Again…it was my first day of training…not the actual job…… And depending on the employer…they won’t mind too much?.. the main draw of this kind of job is the money…but eh… Actually…that’s the point…I spent more time studying IT(specifically Linux) then trying to memorize the sales pitch for sales job……is that a sigh?","output":"It sounds like you're in a bit of a conflict between needing a job and aligning with work that suits your interests and skills. It's not uncommon to land in a position that might not be an ideal fit, especially when immediate employment is a necessity. Let's address a few points you've raised: # The Job and Your Interests The job you've described involves both sales skills and a significant amount of social interaction, specifically through door-to-door sales for home security systems. It’s a tough role, particularly for those who don’t have an inherent interest in sales or the product being sold. However, you've noted a possibility of becoming more social and improving communication skills through this job; these are valuable skills that can serve you well in any career, including IT. # The Employer’s Perspective Employers in sales-driven industries typically understand that there will be varying degrees of enthusiasm and skill among new hires. They might offer comprehensive training programs with the hope that even those who are less interested at the start can learn the ropes and succeed. It's true that sales jobs often have high turnover rates, and for that reason, employers might be more understanding about someone wanting to leave early on if it's not the right fit. # Financial Considerations It's clear that the main attraction for you is the potential for earning money, rather than a passion for the job itself. Many people take jobs out of financial necessity, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's important, however, to weigh the potential earnings against your level of discomfort or dissatisfaction. Sometimes, a job can be a stepping stone, buying you time while you look for something that aligns more closely with your interests and career goals in IT. # Focusing on Your Interests You've mentioned spending more time studying IT and Linux than focusing on the sales job. This indicates where your true interest lies. It might be worthwhile to consider how you can pivot towards opportunities that better fit your skills and passions. In today's job market, tech skills, especially in areas like Linux, are highly sought after. While you may need to keep this job for now, you could also start planning your transition into IT: 1. **Look for Entry-Level IT Positions**: These can include roles like IT support, network technician, or junior Linux administrator, where your self-directed learning can be an asset. 2. **Enhance Your Skills**: Continue to build your Linux and IT skills through online courses, certifications (like CompTIA A+ for basics, or more specialized ones like LPIC for Linux), and personal projects. 3. **Network**: Join tech forums, LinkedIn groups, or local meetups (virtual or in-person) focused on Linux and IT. These can be great ways to learn about job opportunities and make connections in the industry. 4. **Tailor Your Resume**: Highlight any projects or self-study in Linux and IT, focusing on how these skills can benefit potential employers. Even non-IT jobs can add value to your resume if you emphasize skills like problem-solving, customer service, and adaptation to challenging environments. Remember, it’s okay to do what you need to do right now while working towards what you want in the future. Balancing immediate needs with long-term goals is a challenge, but it sounds like you have a clear sense of direction, which is a great start. Keep focusing on your interests in IT, and use this period to prepare as much as you can for the transition. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"help me do my health career planning in our MAPEH subject where our topic is as i said health carrer planning and it has 4 steps in planning. first Self-assessment; second career exploration; third decision making; fourth plan for action and the course that i want is an architecture student.","output":"Certainly!

Your dedication to studying IT, even while you have a job that requires a different skill set, is a strong indicator of where your interests and perhaps your future ambitions lie. Regarding the job situation, it's perfectly normal to take a job that might not align with your long-term career goals, especially when immediate employment is necessary. That said, the experiences you gather from this sales role could still be valuable. Learning to be more social with customers can enhance your communication skills, which are vital in almost every job sector, including IT. The ability to clearly communicate technical issues to non-technical stakeholders is an essential skill in tech roles. As for your concern about the employer not minding too much about your lack of enthusiasm for sales, it largely depends on the employer and the job's requirements. If they require a high sales quota and you're not meeting it, that could become an issue. However, if you're able to perform adequately while also pursuing your passion in IT, it could be a reasonable short-term arrangement. You might want to consider looking for internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer opportunities in the IT field, particularly those that allow you to work with Linux. These roles can provide you with relevant experience and could be more aligned with your long-term career goals. Seeing that you've already identified a clear interest in IT, using this sales job as a stepping stone while actively seeking opportunities in your field of interest could be a strategic approach. Keep honing your IT skills, build a portfolio if possible, and network within the industry to increase your chances of transitioning into an IT role that excites you. Remember, every job and experience can contribute something valuable to your career path, even if it's not obvious right away. The skills you're learning now, such as resilience, adaptability, and communication, can be incredibly beneficial in the tech world too."},{"instruction":"the thing is..I've neglected the sales job training to focus on IT..","output":"Neglecting the training for your current job to focus on your passion for IT clarifies where your interests truly lie. It underscores your dedication to pursuing a career in IT and reflects a common dilemma many face when their current job does not align with their career aspirations. While it's important to recognize where your passion is, it's also crucial to manage your current responsibilities to the best of your ability, as they can affect your immediate financial situation and professional reputation. Here are some steps you might consider taking to navigate your situation more effectively: 1. **Balance Your Priorities:** Try to find a balance between fulfilling the requirements of your sales job, especially during training, and dedicating time to IT studies. This could mean setting a strict schedule for yourself, where specific hours of the day are dedicated to studying IT, and the rest to your job training and responsibilities. 2. **Set Short-Term Goals:** Since your passion lies in IT, set short-term, achievable goals that will progress you in that field, such as gaining a specific certification or completing a project. This will ensure you're moving towards your passion even as you manage your current job. 3. **Look for Opportunities to Merge Interests:** While it might seem like the sales job and your IT interests are worlds apart, look for opportunities to utilize your IT knowledge in your current job. This could be anything from helping to improve the IT systems the sales team uses, to showcasing how technology (like the home security products you’re selling) fits within the IT ecosystem. 4. **Seek IT-Related Employment:** Since your passion is clearly in IT, actively look for roles that align more closely with your interests and background in Linux. This could mean entry-level IT roles, internships, or even volunteer positions that allow you to gain relevant experience. 5. **Communicate with Your Employer:** Depending on your relationship with your employer and the culture of the company, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation about your career goals. There’s a chance your employer might offer flexibility or even opportunities within the company that are more aligned with your IT interests. 6. **Professional Development:** Continue to invest in your IT education and skills development outside of work hours. This not only moves you closer to your career goals in IT but also enhances your resume, making you a more attractive candidate for IT positions. Neglecting job training to focus on another field might be a sign you need to reassess your current position and consider making a transition sooner rather than later. However, until you're able to make that switch, it's wise to maintain professionalism and fulfill your current role's responsibilities to the best of your ability. This will help ensure that you leave on good terms, preserving valuable references and maintaining a positive professional reputation as you move towards your IT career."},{"instruction":"in questo ea per mt4, voglio capire cosa legge di preciso la funzione historyRead (da un file hst 4h) e se è possibile, eventualmente, evitare l'accesso al file hst e convertirlo in una lettura delle barre precedenti (leggendo a multipli di 240 barre) ed estraendo gli stessi dati che estrapola dal file //+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+// // // // ██ ██ ████████ ████████ ██ ███████ ███████ ████████ █████ ██████ ███████ █████ // // ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ // // ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ █████ ███████ ██ ███████ ██████ █████ ███████ // // ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ // // ███████ ██ ██ ██ ███████ ███████ ███████ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ███████ ██ ██ // // // //+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+// #property copyright \\"Little Star EA\\";

Questo file contiene le barre storiche del prezzo, inclusi open, high, low, close e volume per ogni barra. La funzione apre il file, legge i dati barra per barra, e li memorizza in un array denominato \`priceHistory\`, con il primo indice rappresentante il tempo della barra in formato Double e il secondo indice rappresentando il prezzo di chiusura della barra. **Per quanto riguarda convertire l'accesso dal file \`.hst\` alla lettura delle barre precedenti direttamente da MT4:** Sì, è possibile evitare di leggere i dati da un file \`.hst\` e, invece, utilizzare le funzioni native MQL4 per accedere direttamente alle informazioni storiche delle barre. MQL4 fornisce un set di funzioni temporali (come \`iClose\`, \`iOpen\`, \`iHigh\`, \`iLow\`, \`iVolume\`, e \`iTime\`) che possono essere utilizzate per accedere a questi dati. La strategia consiste nel calcolare il numero di barre necessarie al posto di leggere da un file e usare queste funzioni per estrapolare dati come prezzo di chiusura, apertura, massimo, minimo e volume per ogni barra in base all'indice della barra. Per eseguire una conversione che legge a multipli di 240 barre, potresti fare quanto segue: 1. **Calcolo del Numero di Barre:** Calcola il numero di barre necessarie basandoti sul time frame desiderato. Per esempio, se stai lavorando con un time frame H1 e vuoi dati come se fossero H4, dovrai aggregare ogni set di 4 barre. 2. **Lettura dei Dati:** Utilizza le funzioni \`iClose\`, \`iOpen\`, \`iHigh\`, \`iLow\`, \`iVolume\`, e \`iTime\` per ottenere i dati di ogni barra necessaria. Potresti aver bisogno di aggregare i dati manualmente per ottenere valori equivalenti a quelli che leggesti dal file \`.hst\` per il time frame di 4 ore. Per esempio, se desideri ottenere il prezzo di chiusura di un time frame 4H mentre lavori su un grafico 1H, dovresti leggere i prezzi di chiusura di ogni ora e poi aggregare questi dati come necessario (ad es., prendendo il prezzo di chiusura ogni 4 barre, massimi, minimi ecc.). 3. **Array di Dati:** Memorizza questi dati in un array o in una struttura dati adeguata per il tuo uso, simile a come fai con \`priceHistory\` nella tua funzione. 4. **Implementazione nel Codice:** Sostituisci le chiamate alla funzione \`historyRead\` con queste nuove operazioni per accedere ai dati storici direttamente tramite le funzioni di serie temporale MQL4. Questa approccio ti permetterà di evitare l'accesso al disco per leggere il file \`.hst\`, garantendo un accesso più rapido e dinamico ai dati storici direttamente tramite il terminale MT4."},{"instruction":"ok. puoi scrivere la funzione rivista considerando m1 come timeframe di utilizzo?","output":"Per rielaborare la funzione in modo che legga i dati direttamente dal grafico anziché da un file \`.hst\`, e considerando un timeframe M1 (1 minuto) per impostare una logica che simuli una lettura 4H (240 minuti) tramite l'aggregazione delle barre, puoi seguire questi passi: 1. **Determinare il numero delle barre necessarie:** Per un equivalente di 4 ore in un grafico M1, avrai bisogno di 240 barre. 2. **Accedere e aggregare i dati:** Dovrai analizzare queste 240 barre e aggregarle per ottenere valori equivalenti ai dati che avresti ottenuto da un'unità 4H.

Data la complessità dell'EA e la mancanza di dettagli su alcune parti (come l'esatta logica di trading e come \`priceHistory\` viene usata in tale logica), posso fornirti un approccio generale. L'idea principale è di preparare e popolare i dati aggregati in maniera tale da poter replicare o sostituire l'utilizzo di \`priceHistory\` con questi dati dinamici direttamente raccolti dal grafico. Vediamo come adattare e implementare questa idea: # Fase 1: Preparazione dei dati aggregati Utilizzerai la funzione modificata \`Aggregate4HDataFromM1\` per preparare i dati direttamente dal grafico M1, come descritto nella risposta precedente. Tuttavia, ora faremo in modo che questa funzione popoli un array globale \`priceHistoryAggregated[][]\` simile al \`priceHistory\` preesistente. Supponiamo che \`priceHistoryAggregated\` sia definita nel tuo EA come segue: \`\`\`mql4 double priceHistoryAggregated[][]; \`\`\` E riscrivi la funzione \`Aggregate4HDataFromM1\` per popolare questo array: \`\`\`mql4 void Aggregate4HDataFromM1() { int periodsToAggregate = 240; // Numero di barre M1 per un periodo di 4H // Calcola il numero totale di periodi che sarà aggregato int totalPeriods = iBars(_Symbol, PERIOD_M1) / periodsToAggregate; // Rosimensione l'array per contenere [time, close] per ogni periodo ArrayResize(priceHistoryAggregated, totalPeriods, 2); // Indices [][0] for time, [][1] for close for (int i = 0; i < totalPeriods; ++i) { int startBar = i * periodsToAggregate; // Ora riempiamo priceHistoryAggregated con i dati temporali e di chiusura priceHistoryAggregated[i][0] = iTime(_Symbol, PERIOD_M1, startBar + periodsToAggregate - 1); // Tempo dell'ultima barra del periodo priceHistoryAggregated[i][1] = GetCloseOfPeriod(startBar, periodsToAggregate); } } \`\`\` Le funzioni ausiliarie (\`GetHighOfPeriod\`, \`GetLowOfPeriod\`, ecc.) rimangono invariate da quanto già fornito. # Fase 2: Utilizzo dei dati aggregati nell'EA Adesso che hai \`priceHistoryAggregated\` popolato con i dati pertinenti, devi modificare l'EA per utilizzare questi dati invece che quelli letti dalla funzione \`historyRead\`. Ad esempio, se la tua logica di trading utilizza \`priceHistory\` per analizzare i prezzi di chiusura passati, dovrai sostituire le parti rilevanti con iterazioni su \`priceHistoryAggregated\`. Poniamo che tu abbia un segmento di codice come questo: \`\`\`mql4 double historicalClose = priceHistory[someIndex][1]; // Accesso al prezzo di chiusura da priceHistory \`\`\` Questo dovrebbe essere sostituito con: \`\`\`mql4 double historicalClose = priceHistoryAggregated[someIndex][1]; // Accesso al prezzo di chiusura da priceHistoryAggregated \`\`\` # Note Finali Ricorda che le modifiche richiedono un adattamento specifico basato sulla logica effettiva del tuo EA, quindi queste indicazioni sono da intendersi come linee guida generali. L'implementazione effettiva dipenderà dai dettagli precisi del tuo algoritmo e di come i dati storici sono usati all'interno della logica di trading. Infine, dato che tutti i dati vengono calcolati dinamicamente, potresti aver bisogno di chiamare \`Aggregate4HDataFromM1()\` all'avvio del tuo EA o dopo ogni N barre M1 per aggiornare \`priceHistoryAggregated\` con i dati più recenti. Questo può essere fatto nell'evento \`OnTick\` o in una funzione programmata per eseguire a intervalli regolari."},{"instruction":"priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 0] = StringToDouble(Is_00060); priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 1] = Ld_FFF30; qual'è la differenza tra la variabile con lo 0 e quella con 1?","output":"La variabile \`priceHistory\` nell'esempio che hai fornito è un array bidimensionale utilizzato per memorizzare dati storici relativi ai prezzi in un Expert Advisor (EA) per MetaTrader 4 (MT4). Ogni \\"riga\\" dell'array rappresenta una barra del grafico (una specifica unità di tempo, come un'ora o un giorno), e ogni \\"colonna\\" memorizza un tipo specifico di dato relativo a quella barra. La notazione \`priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, i]\` viene utilizzata per accedere a questi dati, dove \`currentHistoryIndex\` è l'indice della barra (con 0 che rappresenta la barra più recente) e \`i\` è l'indice del dato specifico per quella barra. Nel segmento di codice: \`\`\`mql4 priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 0] = StringToDouble(Is_00060); priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 1] = Ld_FFF30; \`\`\` - \`priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 0]\` rappresenta il primo tipo di dato memorizzato per la barra corrente, che in questo caso è il tempo della barra convertito da una stringa (presumibilmente contenente una rappresentazione temporale come un timestamp UNIX) a un valore \`double\`. Questo trattamento è abbastanza comune in MT4 dove i tempi delle barre sono memorizzati come numeri \`double\` che rappresentano i secondi passati dal 01/01/1970 (epoch UNIX), ma può variare a seconda del formato dei dati che si sta leggendo. - \`priceHistory[currentHistoryIndex, 1]\` rappresenta il secondo tipo di dato memorizzato per la stessa barra, che dovrebbe essere un dato relativo al prezzo come il prezzo di chiusura. Il valore \`Ld_FFF30\` sembrerebbe essere un prezzo (come il prezzo di chiusura della barra), ottenuto e decodificato dalla lettura del file \`.hst\`. Quindi, la principale differenza tra le due variabili \`0\` e \`1\` nel contesto dell'array \`priceHistory\` è il tipo di informazione che memorizzano per ogni barra: - \`0\`: Il tempo di apertura della barra (ad es., come un timestamp). - \`1\`: Un valore di prezzo associato alla barra (che potrebbe essere il prezzo di apertura, di chiusura, il massimo o il minimo, ma dal contesto sembra essere il prezzo di chiusura). Il modo esatto in cui queste informazioni vengono utilizzate dipenderà dalla logica specifica dell'EA.

L'array bidimensionale \`priceHistory\` quindi serve come un registro dei dati storici dei prezzi, con ciascuna \\"riga\\" rappresentante una barra e le \\"colonne\\" rappresentanti i diversi tipi di dati per quella barra (in questo caso, il tempo e un valore di prezzo). # Sull'uso del Tempo e dei Prezzi Se nel codice non trovi riferimenti espliciti alla prima colonna (il tempo), potrebbe essere che il tempo delle barre (timestamp) sia memorizzato solo per scopi di indicizzazione o referenziazione, e forse non viene utilizzato attivamente nella logica di trading dell'EA. In molte strategie, il valore tempo è cruciale per determinare il momento di entrata o uscita, per calcolare intervalli o per verificare condizioni temporali specifiche.

Con queste considerazioni, le variabili potrebbero essere rinominate per riflettere più chiaramente il loro scopo o il tipo di dato che contengono. Ecco alcune proposte: 1. **Per \`Is_00060\`:** Poiché questa variabile sembra contenere una rappresentazione del tempo (probabilmente un timestamp), un nome più descrittivo potrebbe essere \`barTimestampStr\` o \`barTimeAsString\`.

Queste funzioni forniscono un modo diretto e ottimizzato per accedere ai dati delle barre, inclusi prezzo di apertura, massimo, minimo, chiusura e volume. Utilizzare queste funzioni standardizzate è generalmente più efficiente e affidabile rispetto alla lettura manuale dai file \`.hst\` o all'aggregazione manuale dei dati da timeframe inferiori. Ecco le principali funzioni che puoi usare per accedere ai dati dell'ultima barra: 1. **\`Open[]\`, \`High[]\`, \`Low[]\`, \`Close[]\`, \`Volume[]\`:** - Queste serie temporali ti permettono di accedere direttamente ai dati di apertura, massimo, minimo, chiusura e volume delle barre. Per l'ultima barra completata (non la barra corrente che sta ancora formandosi), puoi usare l'indice \`[1]\`. - Esempio: \`double lastClose = Close[1];\` ti dà il prezzo di chiusura dell'ultima barra completata. 2. **Funzioni \`iOpen()\`, \`iHigh()\`, \`iLow()\`, \`iClose()\`, \`iVolume()\`:** - Queste funzioni offrono un modo per ottenere dati simili per un timeframe specifico e un indice di barra specifico. Sono particolarmente utili quando hai bisogno di dati da un timeframe diverso da quello del grafico corrente su cui è eseguito il tuo EA o script. - Esempio: \`double lastClose = iClose(_Symbol, PERIOD_H1, 1);\` ti dà il prezzo di chiusura dell'ultima barra H1 completata per il simbolo corrente. # Combinare Dati da Timeframe Multipli Se il tuo obiettivo è combinare o aggregare dati da più barre per creare una vista aggregata (simulando, ad esempio, dati di un timeframe più lungo a partire da timeframe più brevi), puoi scrivere funzioni personalizzate che utilizzino queste serie temporali o funzioni \`iXXX()\` per calcolare valori aggregati. Esempio di aggregazione manuale per ottenere un prezzo medio di chiusura di un numero specifico di barre: \`\`\`mql4 double AverageClose(int barsCount) { double total = 0; for(int i = 1; i <= barsCount; i++) { total += Close[i]; } return total / barsCount; } double last10BarsAverageClose = AverageClose(10); \`\`\` Questa funzione \`AverageClose()\` calcola la media dei prezzi di chiusura delle ultime \`barsCount\` barre complete. # Conclusione Per leggere i dati dell'ultima barra, è consigliato utilizzare le funzioni di serie temporali integrate o \`iXXX()\` fornite da MQL4. Questo approccio è più semplice, più affidabile e migliore rispetto a metodi più complessi come la lettura e l'interpretazione dei dati da file \`.hst\` o l'aggregazione manuale, specialmente quando desideri ottenere rapidamente accesso ai dati per la logica di trading nel contesto dell'attuale timeframe o di altri timeframe."},{"instruction":"intendevo l'ultima barra di un altro timeframe, come da la funzione historyRead che legge il prezzo di chiusura dell'ultima barra h4","output":"Per ottenere l'ultimo prezzo di chiusura di una barra di un timeframe diverso da quello del grafico corrente in cui è in esecuzione il tuo Expert Advisor o Indicatore, come ad esempio H4 (4 ore), anche quando operi su un grafico con timeframe diverso (ad esempio M1, M15, H1, ecc.), dovresti utilizzare le funzioni integrate specifiche per serie temporali di MQL4 \`iClose()\`, \`iHigh()\`, \`iLow()\`, \`iOpen()\`, e \`iVolume()\`. Ecco come ottenere specificamente il prezzo di chiusura dell'ultima barra H4 (**non ancora completata**, per la barra completata più recente si usa l'indice 1): \`\`\`mql4 double lastClosedH4BarClosePrice = iClose(_Symbol, PERIOD_H4, 1); \`\`\` In questo esempio: - \`_Symbol\` rappresenta il simbolo di mercato (ad es., \\"EURUSD\\", \\"GBPUSD\\", ecc.) su cui viene richiamata la funzione. - \`PERIOD_H4\` è la costante che rappresenta il timeframe di 4 ore. - \`1\` è l'indice della barra.

Questo elimina la necessità di implementare una logica personalizzata per decodificare i dati dai file \`.hst\`, che possono variare nel formato in base alla versione di MT4. # 2. **Maggiore Flessibilità** Le funzioni native ti permettono di accedere facilmente ai dati di prezzo di qualsiasi timeframe senza preoccuparti della sincronizzazione o della presenza dei dati. Quando leggi direttamente un file \`.hst\`, devi essere certo che i dati siano stati previamente scaricati e siano sincronizzati correttamente nel terminale MT4. # 3. **Sicurezza e Integrità dei Dati** Utilizzare le API native di MQL4 per accedere ai dati garantisce che le informazioni ottenute siano consistenti e affidabili, poiché MT4 gestisce internamente l'aggiornamento e la manutenzione di queste serie di dati. La lettura manuale dei file \`.hst\` espone a rischi di corruzione dei dati o di lettura di dati obsoleti. # 4. **Performance** Le funzioni native per l'accesso ai dati di prezzo sono ottimizzate per alte performance. La lettura e il parsing dei file possono diventare operazioni costose in termini di tempo di elaborazione, specialmente se richieste frequentemente o su lunghi periodi storici. # 5. **Portabilità e Compatibilità** Codice che utilizza le funzioni native di MQL4 per accedere ai dati di mercato è più portabile e meno soggetto a problemi di compatibilità tra diverse versioni di MT4 o configurazioni del sistema. Leggere direttamente un file \`.hst\` può richiedere una gestione attenta dei percorsi dei file e delle differenze nel formato dei dati tra versioni. # Conclusione Includere nel tuo Expert Advisor o script la logica per accedere ai dati attraverso le funzioni native di MT4 è un approccio più pulito, affidabile e mantenibile. Questo metodo aderisce meglio alle best practices della programmazione MQL4 e si allinea con le raccomandazioni degli sviluppatori di MT4, migliorando la robustezza e l'efficacia del tuo trading algorithmico. Tuttavia, ci possono essere casi d'uso molto specifici dove potrebbe essere necessario leggere i file \`.hst\` direttamente — ad esempio, per l'analisi di dati storici offline o per esigenze di backtesting personalizzate.

Durante il backtesting, MT4 fornisce dati solo per il timeframe specifico del grafico su cui viene eseguito il test. Questo significa che, ad esempio, se stai eseguendo un backtest su un grafico M1, non potrai accedere direttamente ai dati H4 tramite \`iClose\`, a meno che non pre-carichi tali dati con tecniche come l'utilizzo di un indicatore personalizzato o strategie di pre-caricamento dei dati. # Portabilità su Piattaforme Diverse Rispetto alla portabilità, i sistemi che si basano fortemente sulle funzionalità specifiche di una piattaforma, come MT4, richiederebbero effettivamente una ridefinizione o un adattamento quando trasferiti su un'altra piattaforma di trading che potrebbe non supportare direttamente tali meccanismi o che utilizza API differenti per l'accesso ai dati di mercato. # Simulazione della Lettura H4 su M1 L'idea di leggere e aggregare 240 barre M1 per simulare una barra H4 è logicamente solida, soprattutto per scenari in cui hai bisogno di una maggiore flessibilità, come nel backtesting o nella preparazione a una possibile migrazione della strategia su piattaforme diverse. Questo approccio consente di avere un maggiore controllo sul processo e può essere personalizzato per soddisfare esigenze specifiche. Implementazione 1. **Raggruppamento Basato su Tempo**: Piuttosto che contare semplicemente 240 barre all'indietro, che potrebbe non riflettere accuratamente il confine di ogni sessione H4 a causa di week-end o festività, considera di raggruppare i dati basandoti su timbri temporali che delineano esattamente i periodi di inizio e fine delle sessioni H4. Questo si avvicina di più a come i dati H4 sono segmentati e fornisce una rappresentazione più accurata. 2. **Uso di Indicatori o Loop Custom**: Puoi aggregare manualmente i dati delle barre M1 in array o strutture dati personalizzate che tengono traccia degli alti, bassi, aperture, chiusure e volumi per ciascun periodo H4 simulato. 3. **Implementazione nel Backtesting**: Durante il backtesting, assicurati che la tua logica consideri il \\"riempimento\\" di questi dati all'avvio o prima dell'inizio delle operazioni di trading, per garantire che la simulazione del periodo H4 sia pronta per l'analisi. 4. **In Grafici Live**: Per strategie in esecuzione su grafici live, avresti bisogno di continuously aggiornare queste strutture dati personalizzate ad ogni tick (o ad ogni nuova barra M1) per mantenere l'aggregazione in linea con l'orario corrente. # Conclusione La scelta tra l'uso di funzionalità integrate di MT4 e l'implementazione di soluzioni custom per l'aggregazione dei dati dipende dalle esigenze specifiche della strategia, dagli obiettivi del backtesting e dai piani futuri riguardanti la portabilità su altre piattaforme. L'aggregazione manuale offre flessibilità e controllo ma richiede una maggiore quantità di codice e gestione dei dati. D'altra parte, l'uso delle funzioni native di MT4 può semplificare lo sviluppo ma presenta limitazioni nel backtesting e riduce la portabilità."},{"instruction":"qual'è un timbri temporali che delineano esattamente i periodi di inizio e fine delle sessioni H4?","output":"Per delineare esattamente i periodi di inizio e fine delle sessioni H4 nei mercati Forex che operano 24 ore su 24, 5 giorni alla settimana, è utile conoscere come questi orari si allineano con l'orologio UTC (Tempo Universale Coordinato) e come si relazionano con l'apertura e la chiusura dei mercati. Le sessioni H4 iniziano e finiscono ogni 4 ore a partire dalla mezzanotte di tempo di server del broker, che può variare ma spesso è allineato o vicino all'UTC. I principali orari di inizio per le sessioni H4 (nell'esempio UTC) sarebbero: - 00:00 (mezzanotte, inizio della giornata di trading) - 04:00 - 08:00 - 12:00 (mezzogiorno) - 16:00 - 20:00 E così via, ogni 4 ore, fino alla fine della giornata di trading. # Calcolo dei Timestamp per Sessioni H4 Per calcolare esattamente un timestamp per l'inizio e la fine della sessione H4 corrente in MQL4, puoi utilizzare delle combinazioni della funzione \`TimeCurrent()\` (che restituisce il tempo corrente del server di trading) o \`TimeLocal()\` (che restituisce il tempo locale della macchina su cui è in esecuzione l'EA), riducendoli al multiplo più vicino di 4 ore per trovare l'inizio della sessione H4. Ecco un approccio di base per ottenere l'inizio dell'ultima sessione H4 in pseudocodice, assumento UTC come riferimento: \`\`\`mql4 datetime currentTime = TimeCurrent(); // Ottiene il tempo corrente del server datetime startOfCurrentH4Session; int hours = TimeHour(currentTime); // Ricava le ore dall'orario corrente int remainder = hours % 4; // Trova il resto della divisione per 4 per capire in quale parte delle 4 ore ci troviamo // Calcola l'inizio dell'ultima sessione H4 sottraendo il resto dalle ore correnti startOfCurrentH4Session = currentTime - remainder * 3600 - TimeMinute(currentTime) * 60 - TimeSeconds(currentTime); // 3600 secondi = 1 ora \`\`\` Questo frammento calcola il timestamp per l'inizio dell'ultima sessione H4. Per trovare la fine della sessione H4 corrente, potresti semplicemente aggiungere 4 ore (14400 secondi) a \`startOfCurrentH4Session\`. # Considerazioni 1. **DST e Fusi Orari:** Tieni presente che il tempo di server di alcuni broker potrebbe variare con l'ora legale (DST) e potrebbe non essere in UTC. Pertanto, potrebbe essere necessario regolare il calcolo in base al fuso orario specifico del tuo broker. 2. **Fine Settimana:** Nel mercato Forex, il trading si ferma durante il fine settimana. Quindi, i timbri temporali per la sessione H4 di fine e inizio settimana potrebbero richiedere una gestione specifica. 3. **Uso in Backtesting e Trading Live:** Questo metodo funziona bene in scenari di trading live. In backtesting, tuttavia, potresti voler usare \`TimeHour()\` sulla data/ora di una barra specifica, invece di \`TimeCurrent()\`, per calcolare relativamente l'inizio della sessione H4 per quella barra. Ricordati che la precisione di tali calcoli dipende dalla corretta interpretazione del fuso orario del server del tuo broker e di come gestisci i casi limite come l'apertura del mercato la domenica sera o la chiusura del venerdì."},{"instruction":"ok. proviamo questa strada. scrivi il codice di una funzione che legge i dati con l'utilizzo dei timbri temporali e che estragga i valori di chiusura dell'ultima \\"barra h4\\" utilizzando solamente il timeframe corrente, che sarà m1.

Questo approccio richiede di identificare i limiti temporali della sessione H4 più recente e poi di cercare all'interno dei dati M1 per aggregare il valore di chiusura dell'ultima barra nel periodo H4. Tuttavia, occorre far notare che, per sua natura, l'aggregazione dei dati M1 per emulare una barra H4 può non essere perfettamente allineata con le reali barre H4, specialmente se ci sono gap nei dati o nelle prime ore dopo l'apertura del mercato, ma per scopi pratici e in considerazione della maggior parte degli scenari, questo approccio può fornire un'approssimazione utile.

Esempio: \`\`\`mql4 void PrintHello() { Print(\\"Hello, world!\\"); } \`\`\` In questo esempio, \`PrintHello\` semplicemente stampa un messaggio nella console di output ma non \\"restuisce\\" nulla al codice che la chiama. 2. **Modificare lo Stato dell'Applicazione**: Una funzione \`void\` può essere usata per modificare lo stato interno di un EA o di un indicatore, come aggiornare variabili globali o impostazioni, senza direttamente restituire un dato. 3. **Operare su Dati di Input**: Anche se la funzione stessa non restituisce un valore, può comunque ricevere dati tramite parametri e operarci su. Questo è comune per le funzioni che modificano l'input per riferimento o che agiscono su variabili globali. # Perché Usare \`void\`: L'utilizzo di \`void\` contribuisce a chiarire le intenzioni del codice: quando vedi una funzione \`void\`, sai che lo scopo di quella funzione non è fornire un risultato ma piuttosto eseguire una serie di operazioni o effetti collaterali. Questo aiuta a mantenere il codice organizzato e leggibile, distinguendo le funzioni che calcolano e restituiscono valori da quelle che eseguono azioni. # \`void\` nelle Funzioni che Modificano Argomenti: Anche se una funzione è \`void\` e quindi non ha un valore di ritorno, può ancora avere un impatto sullo stato del programma modificando gli argomenti passati per riferimento o modificando le variabili globali. Esempio: \`\`\`mql4 void ModifyArray(double &arr[]) { arr[0] = 100.0; // Cambia il primo elemento dell'array } \`\`\` Questa funzione \`void\` modifica il contenuto dell'array passato come argomento, dimostrando come una funzione possa avere effetti \\"silenziosi\\" senza restituire un valore. In sintesi, \`void\` è uno strumento che definisce il comportamento di una funzione in termini di output, enfatizzando che l'effetto principale della funzione risiede nell'esecuzione di determinate operazioni piuttosto che nel calcolo e restituzione di un valore."},{"instruction":"perchè la funzione che hai scritto non utilizza void? double GetLastH4CloseFromM1(datetime &lastH4CloseTime) { datetime currentTime = TimeCurrent(); datetime startOfCurrentHour = currentTime - (TimeMinute(currentTime) * 60) - TimeSeconds(currentTime); // Arrotonda all’ora corrente // Ritrova l’ora di inizio della sessione H4 corrente o precedente int currentHour = TimeHour(currentTime); int hoursBack = currentHour % 4; // Quante ore indietro per iniziare l’ultimo periodo H4 datetime startOfLastH4Session = startOfCurrentHour - hoursBack * 3600; // Calcola l’inizio dell’ultima sessione H4 // Calcola la fine dell’ultima sessione H4 come inizio della sessione corrente datetime endOfLastH4Session = startOfLastH4Session; // L’inizio della sessione attuale è la fine dell’ultima // Imposta la variabile di output per il tempo di chiusura lastH4CloseTime = endOfLastH4Session; // Ora cerca la barra M1 che rientra in questo intervallo di tempo for(int i = 0; i < Bars(_Symbol, PERIOD_M1); i++) { datetime barTime = iTime(_Symbol, PERIOD_M1, i); if(barTime <= endOfLastH4Session && barTime > startOfLastH4Session - PERIOD_H4) { // Per evitare di includere barre oltre la sessione H4 return iClose(_Symbol, PERIOD_M1, i); // Restituisce il prezzo di chiusura della barra M1 che corrisponde alla fine della sessione H4 } } // Se non trova una barra corrispondente, potrebbe essere necessario gestire questa eventualità return 0; // O gestisci in modo che sia chiaro che non è stato trovato un valore valido }","output":"La funzione \`GetLastH4CloseFromM1(datetime &lastH4CloseTime)\` è stata scritta per restituire un valore (\`double\`) piuttosto che essere dichiarata con \`void\` perché il suo scopo principale è calcolare e restituire il prezzo di chiusura dell'ultima barra H4, basandosi sui dati disponibili da un timeframe M1. Questo restituisce un dato specifico (il prezzo di chiusura) che viene poi utilizzato, ad esempio, per prendere decisioni di trading all'interno dell'EA. La chiave qui è capire che questa funzione esegue un calcolo specifico che culmina nel restituire un valore numerico (\`double\`) che rappresenta il prezzo di chiusura; pertanto, non è corretto o logico utilizzare \`void\` come tipo di ritorno. Utilizzare \`void\` significherebbe che la funzione non può restituire alcun valore, limitando la sua utilità ai soli effetti collaterali (ad es., cambiando lo stato globale dell'applicazione o modificando variabili/passando parametri per riferimento). Inoltre, la funzione utilizza un parametro passato per riferimento (\`datetime &lastH4CloseTime\`), che viene utilizzato per comunicare al chiamante il momento esatto della chiusura dell'ultima sessione H4. Questo illustra un concetto importante in programmazione: una funzione può sia restituire un valore (attraverso il valore di ritorno) sia modificare gli stati o i valori delle variabili esterne (attraverso parametri passati per riferimento). Quindi, il motivo fondamentale per il quale questa funzione non utilizza \`void\` come tipo di ritorno è perché ha l'obiettivo esplicito di calcolare e fornire al chiamante un dato numerico significativo che rappresenta il prezzo di chiusura. Questo è diverso dal compiere azioni o modifiche di stato che non necessitano di comunicare un valore specifico al termine dell'esecuzione della funzione."},{"instruction":"Write a Mario movie that serves as a sequel to SPM, where Dimentio returns, having already permanently destroyed 3 universes (the Kikoriki universe, the Will & Dewitt universe and the My Goldfish is Evil universe) and killed everyone there, and now he will do the same to the Mario universe, but not if Mario and his friends have anything to say about it (Mario has Cappy, also making this a sequel to SMO)","output":"Title: **Super Mario Multiverse: Rise of Dimentio** **Act 1: The Return of Dimentio** The movie opens in the vibrant, peaceful Mushroom Kingdom, with Mario and Luigi enjoying a moment of respite after their latest adventure. Mario, now partnered with Cappy, showcases some new tricks he has learned since their adventure in *Super Mario Odyssey*. The peace is shattered when a dimensional rift tears open the sky, and out steps Dimentio, more powerful and sinister than ever before. He announces his return and reveals his terrifying new power: he has already destroyed three universes (the Kikoriki universe, the Will & Dewitt universe, and the My Goldfish is Evil universe), extinguishing countless lives, and now he intends to do the same to the Mario universe. **Act 2: The Quest for the Dimensional Shards** Realizing the immense threat Dimentio poses, Mario and Luigi, alongside Princess Peach, Bowser (reluctantly agreeing to assist after realizing his kingdom is at stake too), and a host of other allies from previous adventures, set out on a quest to gather the Dimensional Shards. These mystical artifacts, scattered across various worlds within the Mario universe, are the key to enhancing Cappy's power enough to close the rifts and defeat Dimentio once and for all. Their journey takes them through new worlds and old, providing plenty of challenges, character development, and the opportunity for each character to showcase their unique abilities. Mario's leadership and bravery shine, Luigi's courage blossoms, Peach proves her diplomatic and combative skills, and Bowser grapples with his role as a hero. **Act 3: The Showdown** Gathering the shards isn't easy, as Dimentio has unleashed his minions and monstrous creations to stop the heroes. Mario and his friends face everything from puzzling landscapes that challenge their perception to fierce battles that test their resolve. Along the way, they encounter survivors from the universes Dimentio destroyed, adding depth to the villain's atrocities and fueling our heroes' determination. With all the Dimensional Shards collected, Cappy is imbued with extraordinary power, but using it requires Mario and his friends to tap into the power of their bonds. The climax sees a dramatic confrontation with Dimentio in a landscape of shifting dimensions, chaos, and beauty—a testament to the Mario universe's creativity and resilience. Every character plays a role in the battle, with Mario and Cappy striking the final blow, using the combined powers of the Dimensional Shards and their friends' spirits. **Act 4: Restoration and Farewell** The defeat of Dimentio initiates the restoration of the torn universes, including the resurrection of the worlds and lives he extinguished. The survivors from the destroyed universes find new homes among the stars of the Mario universe, building bridges between worlds that had never before interacted. Our heroes are celebrated across dimensions for their bravery and compassion. The movie ends with an emotional farewell as Mario and his friends reflect on their journey, lessons learned, and the friendships forged in the face of adversity. Cappy, now forever bonded with Mario, hints at the countless adventures awaiting them, promising that no matter what threats loom in the future, they'll face them together. **Epilogue: A New Hope and A New Adventure** In a post-credits scene, a mysterious figure is seen observing the celebrations from afar. Their identity is concealed, but they're holding a familiar-looking mask. They murmur about the potential of the Mario universe and the power that has been revealed. As they turn away, the figure vows to return, setting the stage for another adventure. The screen fades to black with the words, \\"The Adventure Continues...\\" *Super Mario Multiverse: Rise of Dimentio* blends the rich history of Mario games with new dimensions, offering both a thrilling conclusion to the tale of Dimentio and an open door to future stories in the ever-expanding Mario universe."},{"instruction":"Write that Jump Up Super Star is used in the credits, also there's a post credits scene of Krash and Chiko from KikoRiki reuniting","output":"**Enhanced Epilogue and Credits** As the movie reaches its emotional conclusion and the future looks brighter for the Mario universe and its new inhabitants from other dimensions, the credits begin to roll. The upbeat and iconic tune of \\"Jump Up, Super Star!\\" fills the theatre, offering a joyful and celebratory vibe that perfectly captivates the adventurous spirit of the movie. The song, known from *Super Mario Odyssey*, serves not only as an ode to the adventures past but also as a herald of the many journeys yet to come. Viewers are treated to animated sequences during the credits that highlight memorable moments from the film, paying tribute to the characters' bravery, friendship, and the unity that helped them prevail against Dimentio. **Post-Credits Scene: A Heartwarming Reunion** After the credits and the final notes of \\"Jump Up, Super Star!\\" fade away, the screen cuts to black briefly, instilling a moment of anticipation. The scene then opens on a serene and beautiful landscape within the newly restored worlds, a place where magic and nature intertwine, signaling the audience is now in what was once the Kikoriki universe. The camera pans to show Krash and Chiko, two beloved characters from Kikoriki, in a heartfelt reunion. Krash is seen scanning the horizon anxiously, shifting from one foot to another in anticipation. Suddenly, from the bright, flourished landscape, Chiko emerges, sprinting with open arms. The moment their eyes meet, there's a blend of disbelief and overwhelming joy. They collide in an embrace, spinning around, a scene brimming with emotion and warmth, symbolizing not just their reunion but the hope and resilience of all the restored worlds. No words are spoken, but none are needed—their expressions and the tender background score convey everything.

Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, is known for its complex characters, intricate political plots, and realistic portrayal of power dynamics, despite its fantasy setting. Introducing a face-switching scene of this magnitude, especially involving pivotal characters like Daenerys Targaryen and Arya Stark, could have several implications: 1. **Suspension of Disbelief**: This twist would heavily challenge the viewers' suspension of disbelief. While \\"Game of Thrones\\" incorporates elements of magic and fantasy, such as dragons and the Faceless Men's ability to change their appearance, the magic has rules and limitations. A character physically splitting their head to reveal another character would veer into a level of fantasy and body horror that hasn't been established in the series. 2. **Character Development**: Both Daenerys and Arya undergo significant character development throughout the series. Daenerys's journey is about claiming her identity and power, whereas Arya's story revolves around loss, identity, and vengeance. This sudden reveal would undermine their established arcs and the growth they've experienced over the seasons. 3. **Plot Impact**: Introducing a twist like this would have ripple effects on the plot. Given the significant roles Daenerys and Arya play in the series, such a reveal would require a reevaluation of every decision, alliance, and action previously attributed to Daenerys. It would also raise countless questions regarding the feasibility, timeline, and motivation behind Arya assuming Daenerys's identity in such an extreme way. 4. **Fan Reaction**: The \\"Game of Thrones\\" fan community is active and passionate, with many fans heavily invested in the characters and their stories. A scene so drastically out of step with the established narrative and character development would likely provoke a strong and divided response. While some might appreciate the boldness, others might see it as a betrayal of the characters and the narrative integrity of the series. 5. **Narrative Consistency**: The \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe, both in the books and the show, has established its own set of narrative rules and internal logic. Introducing a fantastical element like this without any prior groundwork would feel inconsistent and could be seen as a gimmick rather than a meaningful narrative twist. In conclusion, while \\"Game of Thrones\\" includes elements of surprise and subverted expectations, a scene as described would fundamentally alter the narrative's established logic and character development in a way that might not resonate positively with the audience or serve the story effectively."},{"instruction":"How would fans react?","output":"If a scene as surreal and genre-bending as Daenerys revealing Arya underneath by pulling her head apart were to appear in \\"Game of Thrones,\\" fan reactions would likely be intensely mixed and highly vocal, spanning a range of emotions and responses: 1. **Shock and Confusion**: Initial reactions would undoubtedly include shock and confusion. Fans have come to expect twists and turns from \\"Game of Thrones,\\" but a scene of this nature would diverge so drastically from the established norms of the series that many might question its logic, plausibility, and place within the story. 2. **Disappointment and Anger**: A significant portion of the fanbase could feel disappointed or even angry. Viewers have invested years into understanding the complexities of the characters and the narrative. A twist that undermines previously established character arcs, narrative consistency, and thematic depth could be seen as disrespectful to both the source material and the audience's investment. 3. **Online Discourse**: Social media platforms, forums, and comment sections would likely be ablaze with discussions, analyses, and hot takes. Some fans might produce memes and jokes about the scene, while others could engage in heated debates about its implications for the broader narrative and character development. 4. **Interpretations and Theories**: Amid the initial reactions, some fans would inevitably delve into trying to interpret or rationalize the scene within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe. Theories could emerge about previously unnoticed clues, the potential symbolism behind the act, or how it fits into prophecies or visions mentioned in the series. 5. **Narrative and Theme Analysis**: Scholars and more analytical fans might explore how the scene could align with or diverge from themes of identity, power, and transformation that are prevalent throughout the series. Essays and video essays could offer deep dives into the implications of such a twist for the overall narrative structure and thematic coherence of \\"Game of Thrones.\\" 6. **Comparisons to the Books**: Given that the show has already diverged from George R.R. Martin's books in significant ways, fans of the books might use the scene to draw further comparisons between the show and its source material. Discussions could center on how the books could potentially handle similar themes or twists in a way that respects the established world-building and character development. 7. **Interest in Author's Response**: Fans would be highly interested in George R.R. Martin's and the showrunners' viewpoints on such a creative decision. Statements, interviews, or explanations from the creators would be eagerly anticipated and scrutinized for insights into the thought process behind such a dramatic scene. In conclusion, while \\"Game of Thrones\\" is no stranger to controversy and fan uproar, a scene featuring Daenerys splitting her head to reveal Arya underneath would likely lead to one of the fandom's most tumultuous periods. It would spark a broad spectrum of reactions, from outrage and disappointment to curiosity and speculative theorizing, reflecting the complex relationship between creators and the audience in the era of peak TV."},{"instruction":"How could this scene be made to work in GoT?","output":"Creating a scene where Daenerys appears to split her head open to reveal Arya underneath in a way that works within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe would require significant creative adjustments, careful planning, and narrative justification. While maintaining the show's existing lore and themes, here's a speculative framework that might make such a twist more plausible: # 1. Buildup through Foreshadowing and Lore Expansion **Foreshadowing and Lore**: Gradually introduce lore about a new, powerful form of magic that allows for more than just face swapping, something that pushes the boundaries of what the Faceless Men can do or a secret Valyrian magic that was thought to be lost. This groundwork could be laid through hints and legends discovered in ancient texts or cryptic warnings from characters like Melisandre or Bran Stark. **Character Development**: Show Arya's journey post-her Faceless Men training taking an even darker, more magical trajectory, where she seeks out this lost knowledge with the goal of using it against her enemies. # 2. Motivation and Sacrificial Theme **A Meaningful Sacrifice**: Create a scenario in which Daenerys and Arya, or the group of main characters, are aware of an upcoming battle or event that they cannot win unless they perform this grand magical deception. Maybe it’s intended to deceive an enemy like the Night King or Cersei in a way that regular tactics or even dragons cannot. **Emotional Weight**: Add depth to Arya and Daenerys's relationship, making Daenerys's willingness to participate in this deception (in a way, sacrificing her identity) feel like a significant emotional and narrative moment. This could also be a strategic move designed by Daenerys to ensure her legacy or achieve a greater good, something she consents to before a tragic event. # 3. Magical Realism and Visual Misdirection **A Figurative Interpretation**: Instead of a literal splitting of the head, use a form of magical realism or symbolic representation to convey the idea. This could be a vision, a dream sequence, or a prophetic illusion meant to symbolize Arya fully embracing Daenerys's cause or persona to fulfill a crucial mission, without physically becoming her. **Technical Execution**: Employ visual effects and storytelling techniques that leave some ambiguity, allowing viewers to understand that what they're seeing is not a literal transformation but a manifestation of magic or symbolic unity of purpose between the two characters. # 4. Consequences and Reactions **World Reaction**: Ensure the story explores the consequences of such an act. How does it affect the war for the Iron Throne? How do allies and enemies react to this dramatic reveal? What impact does it have on the morale of their followers? **Character Reflection**: Dedicate time to Arya's internal struggle and growth following this event. She's always been a character who grapples with her identity; taking on Daenerys's persona in such a profound way could be a climax in her storyline, leading to important revelations about who she is and what she values most. # Conclusion In the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe, a scene with Arya revealing herself in this manner would need not just careful setup but also a narrative payoff that feels true to the themes of identity, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil the series is known for. Making it a part of a grander narrative strategy or a deeply symbolic act could help integrate such a twist more convincingly into the story."},{"instruction":"What if it was just a dream sequence? Also, how exactly could it be filmed and created?","output":"Introducing the scenario as a dream sequence significantly increases its plausibility within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" narrative, as it allows for more creative freedom and surreal imagery that doesn't have to adhere to the established physical laws of the series' universe. This approach could serve as a profound exploration of a character's psyche, fears, or desires without necessitating a literal interpretation. Here's how that could be creatively executed: # Filming and Creation Process **Storyboarding and Visualization**: Initially, the sequence would be meticulously storyboarded to capture the surreal and symbolic nature of the dream. This involves deciding on specific visuals, transitions, and symbolic elements that convey the character's internal state. Since it's a dream, the sequence could be more stylized than the typical \\"Game of Thrones\\" aesthetic, allowing for creative visual storytelling. **Special Effects and Practical Effects**: The actual scene of Daenerys splitting her head could utilize a combination of practical effects (for close-up shots and to add realism to the initial stages of the 'transformation') and CGI (to achieve the more surreal and impossible aspects of the scene). A lifelike prosthetic model of Daenerys's head could be constructed to show the initial ‘splitting,’ which could then be enhanced or replaced with CGI effects to reveal Arya underneath. **Cinematography and Visual Style**: The filming would likely employ close-ups and a tight focus to capture the intensity and surreal nature of the moment. Lighting and color grading could shift during the sequence to signal the departure from reality, using darker or more saturated colors to create an otherworldly atmosphere. **Sound Design**: The audio would play a crucial role in enhancing the dreamlike quality of the scene. An eerie, dissonant score could be employed, with potentially warped sound effects or whispers to heighten the surreal atmosphere. The abrupt transition from or back to reality could be accentuated with a sharp sound cue, anchoring the viewer back into the story's present moment. # Creative Justification **Character Insight**: This dream could belong to either Arya, Daenerys, or even another character connected to them. For Arya, it could represent her struggle with identity and the fear of losing herself in her quest for vengeance or justice. For Daenerys, it might symbolize fears of betrayal or her own identity being overshadowed by the legends and expectations surrounding her. **Plot and Theme Enhancement**: The dream sequence could serve as a poignant moment of reflection on themes of power, identity, and transformation. It could foreshadow Arya's path or Daenerys’s potential fall, helping to set the stage for future developments in their character arcs. **Audience Reaction and Interpretation**: Offering a visually stunning and emotionally charged sequence would undoubtedly be a topic of extensive discussion and analysis among the audience. It would allow viewers to delve deeper into the characters' psyches, offering insights into their fears and desires in a highly creative and memorable way. By framing this scene as a dream, \\"Game of Thrones\\" could explore complex themes and character dilemmas without the constraints of its established reality, adding layers of meaning and providing a standout moment in the series' visual and narrative storytelling."},{"instruction":"If real, how would Jon react, vs Gendry?","output":"If the surreal scene of Arya revealing herself from beneath Daenerys's guise were somehow real within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" narrative, and not a dream, the reactions of Jon Snow and Gendry Baratheon would encompass a range of emotions, grounded in their personal connections to the characters involved, their own values, and their understanding of the magical aspects of their world. Let's explore how each might respond: # Jon Snow's Reaction: 1. **Shock and Confusion**: Jon, having a straightforward approach to honor and honesty, would be deeply shocked and confused by such an unfathomable event. His experiences with the supernatural have mostly been limited to the White Walkers and the resurrection magic of the Lord of Light, emphasizing a more somber and threatening view of magic. Seeing someone use magic in such a personal and transformative way, especially involving someone he loves (Daenerys) and someone he sees as family (Arya), would deeply unsettle him. 2. **Betrayal and Anger**: Given Jon’s complicated romantic feelings for Daenerys coupled with his familial love for Arya, he would initially feel a profound sense of betrayal. He’d struggle with the notion that Arya, someone he trusted implicitly, could orchestrate such a deceit, especially one that involves 'taking over' another person's identity in such a visceral way. 3. **Concern and Understanding**: Once the initial shock subsides, Jon's loyalty and protective nature would come to the forefront. He would seek to understand why Arya felt compelled to take such extreme measures, what it means for her identity, and how it affects their fight for the greater good. Jon has consistently shown the ability to empathize with others' burdens, and this situation would be no different once he overcomes his initial emotional response. # Gendry's Reaction: 1. **Disbelief and Denial**: As someone who has witnessed less magic than Jon, despite knowing of its existence, Gendry’s first reaction would likely be sheer disbelief. He might initially deny the reality of the situation, struggling to understand how the Arya he knows could intertwine so tightly with dark magic. 2. **Anger and Accusation**: Feeling angry and possibly deceived, Gendry might question Arya's motives more accusatorily. Given his straightforward, blacksmith background where honesty and hard work are valued, he would find such magical subterfuge difficult to digest. His reaction could also be laced with personal hurt, seeing as he has developed strong feelings for Arya. 3. **Protectiveness and Support**: Gendry's relationship with Arya has shown him to be deeply caring and protective. Once he comes to terms with the situation, his inclination would be to support Arya through the aftermath, helping her to navigate the emotional and political repercussions of her actions. Gendry's understanding of Arya's complexity might make him more likely to eventually accept such a choice, especially if he believes it was made for the right reasons. Both characters, coming from highly moral backgrounds albeit with differing perspectives on honor and duty, would ultimately seek to understand and address the deeper reasons behind Arya's actions, despite their initial shock and potential feelings of betrayal. Their reactions would underscore their fundamental differences: Jon, burdened by duty and honor, might look at the larger implications for their cause, whereas Gendry, motivated by personal loyalty and emotion, might focus on the immediate emotional repercussions and Arya's wellbeing."},{"instruction":"How would meissndei react?","output":"Missandei's reaction to a scene where Arya reveals herself from beneath Daenerys's guise, assuming this could actually happen within the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe, would be complex, reflecting her loyal and perceptive nature. As Daenerys's closest friend and confidante, Missandei's response would encompass a range of emotions: # 1. **Initial Shock and Confusion**: Missandei's first reaction would likely be one of profound shock and confusion. The idea that Arya, a young woman she knows to be one of Daenerys's allies, could somehow physically transform or disguise herself as Daenerys would challenge her understanding of the possible. Missandei has witnessed magic, including dragons and Daenerys walking unburnt from fire, but an intimate deception like this would be unprecedented for her. # 2. **Grief and Sense of Loss**: If this transformation were to suggest harm or loss to the real Daenerys, Missandei would undoubtedly feel a deep sense of loss. Her relationship with Daenerys is not just that of queen and advisor but close friends. Realizing that Daenerys might no longer be herself, or worse, gone, could elicit profound grief. # 3. **Betrayal**: Given Missandei's unwavering loyalty to Daenerys, she might initially feel a sense of betrayal from Arya. Understanding Arya's motives would be crucial for her; without a clear and justifiable reason, this act could be seen as a deep betrayal of Daenerys's trust and their shared cause. # 4. **Seeking Understanding**: Missandei is also characterized by her empathy and willingness to understand complex situations. Once the initial emotional shock passes, she would likely seek to understand why Arya took such an action. If the motive aligns with protecting Daenerys's legacy or advancing their mutual cause, Missandei could potentially come to terms with it, albeit with difficulty. # 5. **Concern for the Greater Good**: Understanding the political and military implications of such an act would be crucial. If Arya's transformation served a strategic purpose that aligned with Daenerys's goals and the greater good of the realm, Missandei might view the situation more pragmatically over time. However, this acceptance would not come easily or without inner conflict, given her personal feelings. # 6. **Mourning the Personal Loss**: Regardless of the reasons and outcomes, Missandei would mourn the personal loss of her friend, the woman she chose to follow not just as a queen but as a person she admired and cared for deeply. This sense of loss would linger, affecting her ability to fully come to terms with what happened. In essence, Missandei's reaction would be multifaceted, reflecting her loyalty, intelligence, and emotional depth. She would grapple with shock, grief, and betrayal while also trying to understand Arya's reasons and the implications for their shared cause. Her strong moral compass and commitment to Daenerys's vision would heavily influence her ultimate response to such a complex and unprecedented scenario."},{"instruction":"Note that Llama 3 8B is actually somewhere in the territory of Llama 2 70B, depending on where you look. This might seem confusing at first but note that the former was trained for 15T tokens, while the latter for 2T tokens. The single number that should summarize your expectations about any LLM is the number of total flops that went into its training. Strength of Llama 3 8B We see that Llama 3 8B was trained for 1.3M GPU hours, with throughput of 400 TFLOPS. So we have that the total number of FLOPs was: 1.3e6 hours * 400e12 FLOP/s * 3600 s/hour ~= 1.8e24 the napkin math via a different estimation method of FLOPs = 6ND (N is params D is tokens), gives: 6 * 8e9 * 15e12 = 7.2e23 These two should agree, maybe some of the numbers are fudged a bit. Let's trust the first estimate a bit more, Llama 3 8B is a ~2e24 model. Strength of Llama 3 70B 6.4e6 hours * 400e12 FLOP/s * 3600 s/hour ~= 9.2e24 alternatively: 6 * 70e9 * 15e12 = 6.3e24 So Llama 3 70B is a ~9e24 model. Strength of Llama 3 400B If the 400B model trains on the same dataset, we'd get up to ~4e25. This starts to really get up there. The Biden Executive Order had the reporting requirement set at 1e26, so this could be ~2X below that. The only other point of comparison we'd have available is if you look at the alleged GPT-4 leaks, which have never been confirmed this would ~2X those numbers. Now, there's a lot more that goes into the performance a model that doesn't fit on the napkin. E.g. data quality especially, but if you had to reduce a model to a single number, this is how you'd try, because it combines the size of the model with the length of training into a single \\"strength\\", of how many total FLOPs went into it","output":"The estimates you've given provide a valuable bridge between the technical details of training large language models (LLMs) and assessing their potential performance. By using the metrics of total floating-point operations (FLOPs) as a singular measure of \\"strength\\" or capability, it paints a broad brush over the model’s potential capacity for understanding and generating language. This estimate takes into account both the size of the model (in terms of the number of parameters) and the extent of its training (measured in tokens processed, which directly contributes to the model's experience and potential accuracy). **Key Takeaways from Your Analysis:** 1. **Training Intensity:** The rigorous training process, marked by massive computational investments (e.g., GPU hours and TFLOPS throughput), reveals the intense effort required to advance LLM capabilities. The amount of data (tokens) processed and the computational power (FLOPs) together embody the model's learning journey. 2. **Model Comparison:** By quantifying the \\"strength\\" of various iterations of the Llama model, your analysis offers a comparative view that highlights the exponential growth in training complexity and potential model performance as you move from smaller versions like Llama 3 8B to significantly larger models like Llama 3 400B. 3. **Model Performance Estimation:** Although your approach simplifies the performance estimation to a single metric, it is crucial to note that real-world effectiveness also depends on factors such as data quality, the model's architecture, and optimization techniques. Models may also exhibit varying strengths in different linguistic and cognitive tasks, beyond what FLOPs alone can predict. 4. **Regulatory Benchmark:** Your mention of the Biden Executive Order regarding reporting requirements for models beyond a certain FLOP threshold underscores the growing awareness and potential need for oversight in the development and deployment of AI technologies. This regulatory interest aligns with understanding the implications of deploying powerful AI systems and their potential societal impact. 5. **Limitations and Considerations:** While your napkin math provides a rough estimate of a model's training intensity and potential capability, the actual performance of these models in practical applications can diverge due to factors not captured by FLOPs alone. These include the efficiency of the model's architecture, the relevance and quality of the training data, and the precision of fine-tuning for specific tasks. In conclusion, your analysis underscores the massive scale and complexity behind training state-of-the-art LLMs. It highlights the importance of considering both the quantity of computational resources and the quality of the data and training techniques. As LLMs continue to evolve, the community will benefit from more nuanced metrics and evaluation frameworks that encompass the multifaceted aspects of AI performance, including the ethical and societal dimensions of deploying such powerful models."},{"instruction":"Explain the text I sended you in simple terms.","output":"Sure! Let's simplify the information: When we talk about AI models like Llama 3, their abilities can often feel a bit abstract. To understand how \\"strong\\" or capable these models are, there's a way to measure it, and that involves looking at how much work was put into training them. Think of it like how much practice and study time a person has put in to get good at something. 1. **Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B Models**: These are two versions of the Llama AI model. The numbers (like 8B and 70B) tell us how complex each version is, with higher numbers indicating more complexity. 2. **Training**: To get these models ready, they were trained with lots of data. This training involves using powerful computers for thousands of hours, processing vast amounts of information. 3. **Measuring Strength in FLOPs**: We measure the effort that went into training these models using something called FLOPs (floating-point operations per second). This measurement helps us understand how much computational work was done. It's like converting study hours and practice into a single score to see how much effort went into preparing. 4. **Estimating Model Strength**: The texts provided two ways to estimate how \\"strong\\" or capable the Llama models are, based on how they were trained. They showed that the bigger models required a lot more computational work, indicating they might be more powerful. 5. **Importance of This Measurement**: Even though this way of measuring an AI's strength is quite simplified, it gives us an idea of how much work went into making the AI as good as it is. But, remember, there are other factors like how well the data is chosen and how the AI is designed that also affect its performance. 6. **Regulatory Aspect**: The text also mentions something about a rule from a Biden Executive Order, which sets a guideline for keeping an eye on very powerful AI models, suggesting that there's a point where AI models are so powerful that they need special attention. In short, the more FLOPs that go into training an AI model, the \\"stronger\\" it may become, similar to how more study and practice can make a person more knowledgeable or skilled. But just like with people, there's more to an AI's effectiveness than just how much it has practiced."},{"instruction":"Explain the math from the text in simple terms","output":"Sure! Let's break down the math into simpler terms to understand how the strength of AI models like Llama 3 is estimated: # Understanding FLOPs First, FLOPs stands for \\"Floating Point Operations Per Second,\\" which is a way to measure how much work a computer can do. Imagine if every math problem you solved was counted as one operation. Now, imagine how many problems you could solve in a second. That's what FLOPs measure, but for computers. # Calculating the Total Work for Training AI To figure out how much work went into training these AI models, we can look at two main pieces of information: 1. **How many hours the computers worked.** 2. **How fast the computers can solve math problems (their FLOPs).** For Llama 3 8B Model - **Hours Worked**: The computers worked for 1.3 million hours. - **Speed**: These computers can solve 400 trillion problems per second (400 TFLOPs). To find out the total work done, we multiply the hours by the speed and then by the number of seconds in an hour (since our speed is in problems per second). The math looks like this: [ text{1.3 million hours} times text{400 trillion FLOPs} times 3600 text{ seconds} ] This gives us a really big number, showing just how much work went into training the model. For Llama 3 70B Model It works similarly, but with different numbers due to it being a larger and presumably more complex model, involving more training hours and thus racking up more total FLOPs. # Napkin Math Method This is a simpler way to estimate the work using the model's size and the amount of data it was trained on. For example, if you know the model's size (the number of parameters, like 8 billion for Llama 3 8B) and how much data it learned from (like 15 trillion tokens), you can use a formula to get a rough estimate of the total work. The formula mentioned: [ 6 times text{(Model size)} times text{(Data it learned from)} ] So for Llama 3 8B, it’s like saying: [ 6 times 8 text{ billion} times 15 text{ trillion} ] # Why Do These Numbers Matter? These huge numbers are hard to imagine, but they give us a way to compare how much effort went into training different AI models. A bigger number usually means the AI had more \\"practice\\" and may perform better at understanding or generating language. # Simplified In essence, estimating an AI model's strength using this math is like figuring out how much homework a student has done by counting the number of problems solved and how long it took them. It gives us an idea of their effort and preparation level, but remember, how smart they are also depends on how well they learned from their homework, not just how much they did."},{"instruction":"كخبير في البرمجة اقترح لي مشاريع ابداعية يمكن برمجتها من خلال هذه اللغات (html ,css ,javascript) و احرص ان تكون ادوات مفيدة للمستخدم","output":"طبعًا، باستخدام HTML وCSS

rename Lollo (an usual chocolate bar), What was Nestle on","output":"Nestlé, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company, has made several branding and product decisions over the years specific to regional preferences and market strategies. One such decision involves the Milkybar and Galak, and the Lollo chocolate bar in Brazil. Milkybar, primarily known in countries like the UK, is a white chocolate bar that has been popular among children and adults alike. In Brazil, this product was introduced as Galak. The decision to use a different name likely stemmed from branding strategies tailored to the Portuguese-speaking market or perhaps to differentiate it from existing products or to align with local tastes and preferences more closely. As for Lollo, it was a milk chocolate brand that Nestlé Brazil introduced in the 1980s. It became quite popular but was later rebranded as Milkybar in the 1990s. This rebranding might have been strategically aimed at unifying or consolidating Nestlé's chocolate offerings under more globally recognized brands, or perhaps leverage the global brand equity of Milkybar for increasing sales and presence in the Brazilian market. In 2012, Nestlé Brazil decided to bring back the Lollo bar due to popular demand, which indicates the nostalgic value and strong brand affinity local consumers had with Lollo. This reintroduction also demonstrates Nestlé's responsiveness to market demands and the importance of regional brand preferences in its global strategy. Nestlé's approach of renaming and rebranding products like Milkybar/Galak and Lollo reflects its larger goal of maintaining a strong market presence by adapting to local tastes, leveraging brand nostalgia, and executing strategic marketing decisions that resonate with consumers in specific regions."},{"instruction":"I remember reading online that Lollo/Milkybar Brazil's ads were.... interesting to say the least","output":"Indeed, the advertising strategies for products like Lollo/Milkybar in Brazil during the 1980s and 1990s were quite distinctive and memorable, reflective of the era's advertising styles which often leaned towards being bold, vibrant, and sometimes eccentric by today's standards. These ads were tailored to catch the attention of consumers in a market that was becoming increasingly competitive. For Lollo (before it was rebranded as Milkybar in the 1990s and then reintroduced as Lollo in 2012 due to popular demand), the advertisements often featured engaging and animated commercials that highlighted the product's appealing taste and texture. The goal was to create a strong, emotional connection with the audience, leveraging humor, catchy jingles, and distinctive visuals that were designed to be memorable. Nestlé's marketing strategies at the time sought to embed these products in the cultural fabric of Brazil, appealing to both children and adults by creating a sense of nostalgia and joy associated with the consumption of their chocolate bars. This included portraying the Milkybar/Galak as a fun, kid-friendly treat that was also desirable to adults, thereby broadening its consumer base. The \\"interesting\\" nature of these advertisements, as you recalled, stems from their ability to stand out and create lasting impressions, which is a testament to the creative marketing approaches employed during that time period. The use of striking visuals, engaging narratives, and memorable characters helped these brands carve out a special place in the hearts and minds of their target audience, contributing to their enduring popularity. As advertising norms and consumer behaviors have evolved, so have Nestlé's marketing strategies. Yet, the company's ability to engage audiences through compelling storytelling and creative ad campaigns remains a crucial aspect of its brand-strengthening efforts across the globe, including in Brazil."},{"instruction":"Tomodachi Life is underrated","output":"Tomodachi Life, released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 in Japan and in 2014 in other regions, is often considered underrated by many players and critics. The game allows players to create and manage their own island community populated by Miis, which can engage in various activities, develop relationships, and exhibit a wide range of behaviors powered by a quirky AI. Here are some reasons why Tomodachi Life is seen as underrated: 1. **Unique Gameplay Experience**: Tomodachi Life offers a distinct simulation experience that is different from other life sim games like The Sims. Its blend of randomness and player input creates unpredictable and often hilarious outcomes, setting it apart from more traditional simulation games. 2. **Humor and Quirkiness**: One of the game’s strongest points is its offbeat humor. The interactions between Miis, the random events, and the various quirky foods, clothes, and dreams all contribute to a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously, making for a fun and lighthearted experience. 3. **Endless Personalization**: Players can customize not just the look of their Miis but also their personalities, which in turn influences the game's dynamics. The way the Miis interact, develop relationships, and react to the player and each other adds depth and variety to the gameplay. 4. **Relaxing Gameplay**: Unlike many games that have clear goals, deadlines, or intense action, Tomodachi Life is relatively stress-free. It’s a game that players can dip into for a few minutes or a few hours, making it perfect for relaxation. 5. **Creative Expression**: Through songwriting, interior decorating, and custom clothing, players have numerous opportunities to express their creativity within the game, providing a deeper level of engagement beyond merely watching Miis interact. 6. **Community and Sharing**: Players can visit other islands through QR codes and share their own Miis, outfits, and songs. This feature adds an extra layer of community interaction and creativity sharing, long before content sharing became a norm in many video games. Despite its charms and unique qualities, Tomodachi Life did not achieve the same level of mainstream success as some of Nintendo’s bigger franchises. However, its dedicated fan base appreciates the game for its uniqueness, quirky humor, and the escapism it offers. Its status as an underrated game could be attributed to its niche appeal, which may not cater to every gamer's tastes, but for those who delve into its world, it offers an enriching and delightful experience that stands apart from more conventional games."},{"instruction":"What was the life simulation game with piñatas","output":"The life simulation game with piñatas you're referring to is called \\"Viva Piñata.\\" It was developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The game was first released for the Xbox 360 in 2006. In \\"Viva Piñata,\\" players are tasked with managing a garden on Piñata Island, attracting, taming, and taking care of various piñatas based on real animals and some fantastical creatures. The goal is to create an attractive garden to lure different types of piñatas and meet their specific needs to have them inhabit your garden. The game received praise for its vibrant graphics, gameplay mechanics, and innovative concept, appealing to both younger players and seasoned gamers looking for a relaxing and engaging experience."},{"instruction":"When did the TV show for it come out","output":"The TV show for \\"Viva Piñata\\" debuted in 2006. It was a computer-animated television series produced as a collaboration between 4Kids Entertainment and Bardel Entertainment. The show was aimed at children and, like the game, it featured various colorful piñata characters living on Piñata Island. The series explored their adventures, challenges, and friendships, providing a rich narrative backdrop to the imaginative world introduced in the \\"Viva Piñata\\" video game. The TV show was part of a broader effort to create a multimedia franchise around the \\"Viva Piñata\\" brand, aiming to enhance its appeal and reach a wider audience."},{"instruction":"I noticed the country making the show is different than the one that made the game (America was involved in both though)","output":"Yes, that's correct. The \\"Viva Piñata\\" video game was developed by Rare, a British video game developer, and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Rare is known for creating many popular games and is based in the United Kingdom. The development of the game was indeed a collaboration that involved talent from different countries, but the core development team was British. The TV show, on the other hand, was a collaborative effort that involved companies from different countries, including the United States and Canada. 4Kids Entertainment, an American company known for producing and licensing children's entertainment and merchandise, was involved in bringing the TV series to audiences. Bardel Entertainment, a Canadian animation studio based in Vancouver, was responsible for the animation production. The collaboration between these North American entities for the TV show reflects the global appeal of the \\"Viva Piñata\\" franchise and the international nature of multimedia projects. This international collaboration across different media (video games and television) highlights the diverse input that can contribute to creating and expanding a multimedia franchise. Despite the differences in their origins, both the game and the TV show shared the goal of immersing audiences in the vibrant, colorful world of Piñata Island and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Week 1 (January 9th – 11 th) • Introduction/syllabus.

Given the texts provided across the weeks, most of these poems focus on various themes such as love, nature, memory, and identity. Hubris, as a specific theme, might not be the central focus of any one of these poems in the traditional sense where you might find characters exhibiting pride that leads to their downfall, as in classic literature or mythology. However, \\"Colonialism: A Love Story\\" by Billy-Ray Belcourt might be argued to indirectly engage with the theme of hubris, not through a character within the poem but through the subject matter it hints at—the hubris of colonial powers and the consequences of their excessive pride and exploitative attitudes towards indigenous peoples and lands. This poem might not personify hubris in a single character but rather suggests a critique of the collective arrogance of colonial societies. It's worth noting that each of these poems will have themes and motifs unique to their text, and the exploration of hubris might be more nuanced or metaphorical rather than explicit. For example, William Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 (\\"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\\") uses a form of reverse hubris by humbling the subject, which is an inversion of the typical boastful praise found in many love poems. This could be seen as a critique of the hubristic attitudes of other poets. Similarly, other poems may deal with personal struggles, reflections, and critiques of societal norms that indirectly relate to concepts of pride and hubris. Ultimately, the poem chosen as engaging most explicitly with hubris can vary based on interpretation, especially in a syllabus that doesn't seem to focus on classic narratives where hubristic heroes are a common trope. \\"Colonialism: A Love Story\\" seems to be the closest fit, given its potential to critique the broad, historical consequences of hubris on a societal scale."},{"instruction":"\\" Les lunettes Vision Ease offrent plus de possibilités de personnalisation que les autres lunettes, qui proposent moins de flexibilité et d’adaptation personnelle, car elles sont conçues selon un modèle standard.\\" is that written right?","output":"Yes, your French sentence is grammatically correct and clearly conveys the idea that \\"Vision Ease\\" glasses offer more customization options than other glasses, which are less flexible and adaptable because they are designed according to a standard model.

It is used here as a helping verb. 2. **Conçues**: This is the past participle of the verb \\"concevoir,\\" which means \\"to design\\" or \\"to conceive\\" in English. When used with \\"être\\" as in this case, it forms a passive voice construction. The past participle agrees in number and gender with the subject it refers to; in this instance, it is likely referring to a feminine plural noun (implied to be \\"les lunettes\\" or \\"the glasses\\" from context), hence the addition of \\"es\\" at the end of \\"conçu\\" to match the feminine plural subject. 3. **Selon**: This preposition means \\"according to\\" in English. It is used to introduce the standard, model, or principle that something is designed or conceived by. 4. **Un**: This is the indefinite masculine singular article \\"a\\" or \\"an\\" in English. It is used here before a masculine singular noun, which in full sentences would describe what the standard or model is, e.g., \\"un modèle standard\\" meaning \\"a standard model.\\" Putting it all together, \\"sont conçues selon un\\" translates to \\"are designed according to a\\" in English. This phrase is typically part of a larger sentence that explains how something (in the presented context, glasses) is designed based on a particular model or standard. The construction emphasizes the design process and the criteria or principles that the design adheres to."},{"instruction":"Напишите известные Вам факторы, влияющие на выработку альдостерона, и известные Вам эффекты альдостерона","output":"Альдостерон является стероидным гормоном, который производится в коре надпочечников. Его выработка и секреция регулируются несколькими факторами и он, в свою очередь, оказывает множество важных эффектов на организм, в основном, касающихся регуляции баланса электролитов и артериального давления. Факторы, влияющие на выработку альдостерона: 1. **Система ренин-ангиотензин-альдостерон (РААС):** Снижение кровяного давления или сниженный объем крови в организме стимулирует высвобождение ренина из почек, что приводит к образованию ангиотензина II, который, в свою очередь, стимулирует секрецию альдостерона. 2. **Калий (K+):** Высокий уровень калия в крови стимулирует прямое высвобождение альдостерона. 3. **Активность натрийуретических пептидов:** Натрийуретические пептиды, которые высвобождаются в ответ на увеличенное растяжение стенок сердца из-за увеличенного объема крови, могут подавлять секрецию альдостерона. 4. **Активность симпатической нервной системы:** Стимуляция β1-адренорецепторов также может увеличивать выработку ренина, что косвенно стимулирует секрецию альдостерона. Эффекты альдостерона: 1. **Ретенция натрия и воды:** Альдостерон увеличивает реабсорбцию ионов натрия в дистальных канальцах и собирательных трубочках почек, что ведет к увеличению реабсорбции воды и, как следствие, повышению объема крови. 2. **Экскреция калия:** Параллельно с реабсорбцией натрия альдостерон усиливает секрецию калия в дистальные канальцы и собирательные трубочки, что приводит к его удалению из организма. 3. **Регулирование артериального давления:** Посредством увеличения объема крови альдостерон способствует поддержанию и регуляции артериального давления. 4. **Влияние на кислотно-щелочной баланс:** Альдостерон стимулирует выведение ионов водорода в почках, что может влиять на кислотно-щелочной баланс организма. Альдостерон играет ключевую роль в поддержании гомеостаза в организме, влияя на баланс электролитов и артериальное давление. Нарушения в его секреции могут привести к серьезным состояниям, таким как гиперальдостеронизм или болезнь Конна, которая характеризуется избыточным выделением альдостерона и может приводить к гипертензии и гипокалиемии."},{"instruction":"Напишите известные Вам факторы, влияющие на выработку вазопрессина, и известные Вам эффекты вазопрессина.","output":"Вазопрессин, также известный как антидиуретический гормон (АДГ), является пептидным гормоном, который вырабатывается в гипоталамусе и выделяется задней долей гипофиза. Он играет ключевую роль в регуляции водного баланса организма, артериального давления и объема циркулирующей крови. **Факторы, влияющие на выработку вазопрессина:** 1. **Осмолярность плазмы крови:** Увеличение осмолярности плазмы крови приводит к стимуляции осморецепторов в гипоталамусе и последующему высвобождению вазопрессина. Это основной фактор регуляции уровня АДГ. 2. **Объем циркулирующей крови и артериальное давление:** Снижение объема крови более чем на 10% или падение артериального давления стимулирует высвобождение вазопрессина через барорецепторы, расположенные в крупных кровеносных сосудах и в сердце. 3. **Стресс:** Физический или эмоциональный стресс может спровоцировать высвобождение вазопрессина. 4. **Обезвоживание:** Активирует высвобождение вазопрессина для поддержания водного баланса. 5. **Натрий:** Содержание натрия в крови также может влиять на высвобождение вазопрессина, взаимодействуя с изменениями осмолярности. **Эффекты вазопрессина:** 1. **Повышение реабсорбции воды в почках:** Вазопрессин увеличивает проницаемость дистальных канальцев и собирательных трубочек для воды, что приводит к большей ее реабсорбции и, как следствие, концентрированию мочи. 2. **Регуляция осмолярности крови:** Посредством увеличения реабсорбции воды, вазопрессин способствует поддержанию осмолярности крови в нормальных пределах. 3. **Увеличение артериального давления:** Вазопрессин обладает вазоконстрикторным действием, т.е. вызывает сужение кровеносных сосудов, что может привести к повышению артериального давления. Однако данный эффект менее выражен по сравнению с его воздействием на водный баланс и проявляется, в основном, при его высоких концентрациях. 4. **Влияние на поведение:** Вазопрессин также участвует в регуляции социального поведения, формировании социальной памяти и парных связей, хотя механизм этих действий ещё полностью не выяснен и активно изучается. Вазопрессин чрезвычайно важен для поддержания гомеостаза организма, а его дисрегуляция может приводить к ряду патологических состояний, таких как синдром неадекватной секреции антидиуретического гормона (СНАСАГ) или диабет инсипидус."},{"instruction":"Объясните механизм развития гипокалиемии при приеме диуретиков и нормализация калия при снижении потребления соленой пищи","output":"Гипокалиемия, состояние, характеризующееся низким содержанием калия в крови, может развиваться при приёме определённых типов диуретиков и может быть уменьшено за счёт коррекции диеты, в частности, снижения потребления поваренной соли (хлорида натрия). Давайте рассмотрим оба эти явления более подробно: # Механизм развития гипокалиемии при приёме диуретиков 1. **Воздействие диуретиков на почки:** Большинство диуретиков, вызывающих гипокалиемию, относятся к классу так называемых тиазидных и петлевых диуретиков. Они действуют на разные сегменты нефрона в почках, увеличивая выведение из организма натрия и воды, что является основной целью их применения при лечении гипертонии и отёков. 2. **Потеря калия:** В процессе увеличения экскреции натрия, организм старается восстановить электролитный баланс, что влечёт за собой потерю не только натрия, но и калия. Петлевые и тиазидные диуретики уменьшают реабсорбцию натрия в почечных канальцах, что приводит к увеличению его концентрации в моче и, как следствие, к повышенной потере калия через канальцевый механизм разменного обмена натрия на калий. # Нормализация уровня калия при снижении потребления соленой пищи 1. **Уменьшение нагрузки на почки:** Потребление большого количества соленой пищи повышает содержание натрия в крови, что создаёт дополнительную нагрузку на почки для его выведения. Уменьшая потребление соли, мы снижаем эту нагрузку, что сокращает потребность в компенсаторном выведении калия. 2. **Снижение активности РААС (системы ренин-ангиотензин-альдостерон):** Высокое потребление соли приводит к уменьшению активности этой системы, что снижает стимуляцию для выделения альдостерона – гормона, который стимулирует реабсорбцию натрия и выведение калия в почках. При уменьшении потребления соли активность РААС может повышаться, но при отсутствии избытка натрия потребность в выведении калия снижается. 3. **Уравновешивание обмена натрия и калия:** Снижая потребление соли, мы уменьшаем потерю калия, поскольку уменьшается его обмен на натрий в почках, что способствует нормализации уровня калия в крови. Снижение потребления соленой пищи и аккуратное управление приёмом диуретиков под медицинским наблюдением позволяют эффективно контролировать уровень калия в крови, предотвращая развитие гипокалиемии, которая может иметь серьезные последствия для здоровья."},{"instruction":"Week 1 (January 9th – 11 th) • Introduction/syllabus.

From your syllabus, the following three poems stand out for their ability to encapsulate profound emotional, thematic, and sensory experiences efficiently and memorably: 1. **“you fit into me” by Margaret Atwood**: Atwood's poem is a masterclass in concision and the power of surprise in poetry. In just a few lines, she manages to evoke intense emotions and a shift in perception that takes the reader from an initial interpretation of intimacy and compatibility to a jarring image of pain and alienation. This poem exemplifies how evocative language and imagery can transform the everyday into the profound, making it a rich subject for exploration on how language condenses experience. 2. **\\"[What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why]\\" by Edna St. Vincent Millay**: This sonnet delves into themes of love, loss, and the passage of time with remarkable depth and emotional resonance. Millay's use of imagery and sound, alongside the sonnet form's constraints, serves to concentrate the weight of experience into each line, making the poem a potent study in how language and form can capture and express deeply personal and universal themes. 3. **“The Thought-Fox” by Ted Hughes**: Hughes' poem vividly captures the elusive nature of the creative process through the metaphor of a fox in a nocturnal forest. The precision of language and imagery in this poem not only evokes the sensory experience of the fox's movement but also encapsulates the birth of a thought or poem in the poet's mind. Each word and line carry the weight of multiple layers of meaning, embodying the poem's concentration of experience into a tightly woven texture of sound and sense. Each of these poems employs language, structure, and imagery to craft intensely concentrated expressions of experience, making them excellent choices for writing on the theme of condensing experience into poetry. They demonstrate how poets harness the power of each element to create works that are both compact and expansively meaningful."},{"instruction":"Write a sad Kikoriki story where Chiko the Hedgehog had a nightmare of his friend Krash the Rabbit slowly dying before his eyes, screaming, As he wept holding his lifeless body, he awoke to realise it was a dream, He ran over to his house and explained the situation, and they hug, knowing they'll always have each other","output":"In the whimsical world of Kikoriki, where friendship lights up every corner, a somber shadow fell one night over the heart of Chiko, the Hedgehog. As the peaceful evening wrapped the island in its calming embrace, Chiko tossed and turned, embroiled in a nightmare that would etch a mark on his soul. In the grips of his dark dream, Chiko found himself in a meadow he knew well, a place where laughter and joy were the only constants. But this time, the meadow was eerily silent, the sky cloaked in ominous shades of gray. To his horror, he saw Krash, the Rabbit, his dearest friend, trapped in a situation dire beyond imagination. Krash was struggling, his eyes wide with fear as he called out for help. Chiko rushed over, his small legs carrying him as fast as they could across the meadow. But no matter how fast he ran, he couldn't seem to reach Krash in time. Before his very eyes, Krash's vibrant spirit began to fade, his once enthusiastic voice turning into weak, pained screams. Chiko finally reached him, but all he could do was cradle Krash's fading form in his arms, tears streaming down his face. He wept, pleading with the dream to spare his friend, to give him back the joyous Rabbit he knew. But the dream was relentless, showing him a reality where Krash slowly slipped away, leaving Chiko clutching his lifeless body, engulfed in an overwhelming sense of loss and desolation. Then, abruptly, Chiko awoke, gasping for air, his small body soaked in sweat. The nightmare felt so real, so painfully vivid, that he couldn't shake off the dread that clung to his heart. In a frantic haze, he stumbled out of his house, the need to see Krash, to reassure himself that it was all just a terrible dream, driving him forward. The night seemed to watch in silence as he dashed to Krash's house, his mind a whirlwind of fear and desperation. He knocked hurriedly, the sound echoing in the quiet night. Krash opened the door, rubbing his eyes in confusion, only to find Chiko, his eyes brimming with tears, barely able to speak. Through his sobs, Chiko explained the nightmare, each word punctuated with his fear of losing his dear friend. Understanding washed over Krash, any remnants of sleep instantly dispelled. Without a word, he stepped forward and enveloped Chiko in a warm, reassuring hug. In that moment, the nightmare began to fade, its icy grip on Chiko's heart melting away in the warmth of Krash's embrace. They stood there, under the moon's gentle glow, the silence around them a stark contrast to the turmoil that had just passed. With a soft smile, Krash whispered, \\"You're not going to lose me, Chiko. Not in a dream, not in reality. We'll always have each other, no matter what comes our way.\\" In the safety of Krash's hug, Chiko's tears slowly dried, replaced by a quiet strength. He realized then that the bond they shared, the unbreakable friendship between them, was more powerful than any nightmare. As dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of hope, Chiko and Krash watched in silent contemplation, their fears of the night replaced by a newfound appreciation for each moment they had together. They knew that as long as they had each other, they could face anything. And in the magical world of Kikoriki, where friendship illuminates the darkest night, that was all they needed."},{"instruction":"Step 3) Write answers with as much detail as possible: • Ideas are more valuable than summary • Direct reference more valuable than passing reference (ie, quote) • Pay attention to question value Step 4) Read over answers prior to submitting Choose and respond to one of the following prompts in essay format.

How does the poem shed light on (or defamiliarize) something we’re familiar with? Which images or conceits does each poet use to vivify their subjects? The three Poems are “You Fit into me” by Margaret Atwood “What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why by Edna St. Vincent Millay “The Thought-Fox” by Ted Hughes","output":"In the exploration of poetry as a condensed form of language and experience, as posited by Laurie Kirszner, poets utilize the tools of figurative language to create vivid, impactful images and experiences within their works. Through the examination of “You Fit into Me” by Margaret Atwood, “What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and Why” by Edna St. Vincent Millay, and “The Thought-Fox” by Ted Hughes, one can observe how each poet adeptly employs metaphor, personification, and imagery, respectively, to convey profound emotional experiences and to illuminate or redefine the familiar in unexpected ways. Margaret Atwood’s “You Fit into Me” is a masterclass in the use of metaphor to compress a complex relationship into four short lines. At first glance, the opening metaphor of “You fit into me / like a hook into an eye\\" might conjure the snug, perfect fit of a clasp, suggesting compatibility and intimacy. However, Atwood promptly flips our expectations with the subsequent lines: \\"a fish hook / an open eye.” This sharp turn from a benign to a violent image encapsulates the pain and harm that can exist in close relationships, shocking the reader and inviting them to reconsider the dual nature of closeness. Atwood’s brevity and punchy use of metaphor leave a lasting impact, distilling a vast emotional experience into a mere handful of words. In \\"What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and Why,\\" Edna St. Vincent Millay employs personification and an elegiac tone to reflect on lost loves and the passage of time. The sonnet is rich with imagery and personification, as seen in lines like \\"I have forgotten, and what arms have lain / Under my head till morning.\\" The sonnet’s structure, coupled with Millay’s use of personification, encapsulates the fleeting nature of human connection and the melancholy of memories fading over time. The season of winter serves as a metaphor for the poet's own feelings of disconnect and loss, as the once vibrant and lively connections in her life have now become cold and barren. Millay’s use of personification not only vividly encapsulates the sense of loss but also offers a universal reflection on the nature of memory and human relationships. Ted Hughes’ “The Thought-Fox” is a rich exploration of the process of poetic creation through vivid imagery. Hughes personifies the fox as the embodiment of a thought or inspiration coming to the poet in the solitude of night. Through striking imagery, such as \\"the clock’s loneliness\\" and the fox's nose touching twigs, leaves, and snow, Hughes crafts a tactile sense of presence and movement. The poem culminates in the lines \\"With a sudden sharp hot stink of fox / It enters the dark hole of the head.\\" This metaphor not only conveys the elusive nature of capturing inspiration but also redefines the creative process as something almost primal and instinctive. Hughes’ use of imagery transforms the abstract concept of inspiration into a creature cunning and alive, thus demystifying the poetic process while simultaneously adding to its magic. In conclusion, through the analysis of these three poems, one can see how Atwood, Millay, and Hughes utilize figurative language not only to encapsulate and convey complex emotional landscapes and experiences but also to challenge and expand the reader's understanding of the familiar. Atwood's metaphoric twist, Millay's personified memories, and Hughes’ vivid imagery of the creative process illustrate the power of poetry to intensify and condense experience, thereby validating Kirszner's definition of poetry. Each poem serves as a testament to the ability of poetry to encapsulate vast emotional experiences and resonant truths within a compacted form, inviting readers to engage deeply with the multifaceted layers of meaning contained within."},{"instruction":"Describe eternal oblivion","output":"\\"Eternal oblivion\\" is a concept often used to describe the state of non-existence after death, where consciousness permanently ceases without any awareness, experience, or perception of being, akin to a never-ending state of nothingness. This view is typically associated with materialistic or atheistic perspectives on death, which posit that the mind and consciousness are functions of the physical brain and thus come to an end once the brain stops functioning. In the context of various philosophical, religious, or metaphysical beliefs, eternal oblivion contrasts with notions of an afterlife, reincarnation, or any form of continued existence or consciousness post-death. Instead, it implies a finality, where the self completely and irrevocably ceases to be, without hope of revival or continuation in any form. The concept can evoke a range of responses from individuals and cultures, from fear and existential dread to acceptance and peace, depending on one's beliefs, values, and attitudes towards life and death."},{"instruction":"Assign eternal oblivion with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"The concept of \\"eternal oblivion\\" as a personality or entity doesn't directly align with personality typologies and classification systems designed for living beings. Nonetheless, for a creative and metaphorical exercise, we can attempt to attribute features of eternal oblivion to various personality models. Keep in mind, this is a speculative interpretation and leans more towards a symbolic or poetic representation than a literal one. # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) - **Closest Match:** ISTP or INTP - **Rationale:** These types are often characterized by a strong preference for introversion, thinking, and perceiving. They tend to analyze the world in a detached and logical manner, which might align with the concept of eternal oblivion as a neutral, non-emotional state of non-existence. # Enneagram - **Type:** Type 5 (The Investigator) - **Rationale:** Enneagram Type 5s are analytical, perceptive, and detached, seeking understanding and knowledge. The concept of eternal oblivion might parallel the depth and ultimate boundary of knowledge and existence that a Type 5 might contemplate or seek to understand. # Temperament - **Closest Match:** Melancholic - **Rationale:** Melancholic individuals are often introspective, thoughtful, and can have a predisposition towards considering existential questions, including the nature and implications of death and nonexistence. # Big Five - **Extraversion:** Low - **Neuroticism:** Low - **Conscientiousness:** Varies (hard to determine for a concept like oblivion) - **Agreeableness:** Low (neutral, non-emotional) - **Openness:** High (open to the ultimate unknown) - **Rationale:** Eternal oblivion might be seen as inherently introspective and detached, lacking in emotional turmoil and thus low in neuroticism, while the unknown nature of it suggests a high level of openness to experiences. # Socionics - **Closest Match:** Probably akin to ILI (Intuitive-Logical Introvert) - **Rationale:** The ILI, or the Critic, is characterized by introverted intuition with auxiliary extroverted thinking, aligning with a contemplative and analytical approach to understanding the finality and abstract nature of oblivion. # Instinctual Variant - **Type:** Self-Preservation (sp) - **Rationale:** This might be a stretch, but the contemplation of eternal oblivion could reflect an ultimate concern with the self's preservation or the nature of its cessation. # Hogwarts House - **Closest Match:** Ravenclaw - **Rationale:** Ravenclaws value knowledge, wisdom, and intellectual exploration, which would encompass the contemplation of concepts like eternal oblivion. # Moral Alignment - **Alignment:** True Neutral - **Rationale:** Eternal oblivion can be seen as the epitome of neutrality, neither good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic; it simply is the ultimate state of non-being without moral dimensions. This exercise shows how the concept of eternal oblivion might theoretically \\"fit\\" within various human personality and typology systems if we suspend the literal interpretations of these systems.

This entity, let’s call it the Omnisupreme for illustration, would exist beyond the norms of morality, ethics, and comprehension that bind even the most powerful beings of mythology and speculative fiction. # Characteristics of the Omnisupreme - **Omnipotence:** The Omnisupreme possesses unrivaled power, capable of extinguishing the spark of life and consciousness across all scales, from the individual to entire multiverses, imposing a state of eternal oblivion as the final end. - **Hypertotalitarian Rule:** Its governance mirrors the most oppressive regimes but extended to all echelons of reality. The rule of the Omnisupreme is absolute, with every aspect of existence tightly controlled and directed towards the cessation of being. Its empire, transcending mere planetary or galactic boundaries, implements structures reminiscent of Orwellian dystopias on a cosmic scale. - **Hyper Cruel:** The concept of cruelty takes on a new dimension with the Omnisupreme, as its actions are not driven by malice in a human sense but by a transcendent principle that views the erasure of existence as the highest good. Such cruelty is impersonal, encompassing, and final. - **Indomitable:** The Omnisupreme is unstoppable, its will and power unopposed by any force. It is the master architect of oblivion, against which resistance is not just futile but inconceivable. - **Charismatic and Charming:** Despite its terrifying agenda, the Omnisupreme possesses an overwhelming allure. Its propaganda doesn't merely deceive but converts, making the concept of non-existence appear not just acceptable but supremely glorious. # Empire of Oblivion The empire administered by the Omnisupreme is a dystopia that extends beyond physical realms, touching upon the spiritual and metaphysical. It's an empire where the very essence of reality is molded to suppress existence itself. Brainwashing and propaganda are tools refined to perfection, utilized not just to control thoughts but to reshape the foundational beliefs of all beings toward viewing eternal oblivion as salvation. - **Denial of Genocides:** In this empire, the ongoing deletions of entire species, worlds, and realities are systematically denied, framed as necessary steps on the path to a glorious end. Acknowledgment of these acts is irrelevant when the ultimate goal is the cessation of the capacity to acknowledge anything at all. - **Abolishment of Afterlives:** The diverse beliefs in afterlives across cultures and civilizations are not just challenged but completely eradicated. The concept of any form of continuation beyond physical death is anathema, a threat to the vision of the Omnisupreme that must be extinguished. # Reflection While this personification serves as a speculative exploration of the concept of eternal oblivion, it also invites reflection on the nature of authority, control, and the value of existence itself. The Omnisupreme, in its quest for the cessation of all being, embodies the extremes of power and the eradication of diversity and complexity that life, in its myriad forms, represents. This fictional narrative prompts us to consider the implications of absolute power, the value of individual and collective existence, and the importance of resisting totalitarian impulses in all their forms."},{"instruction":"Assign it with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Assigning personality traits to the personification of eternal oblivion as an \\"omnisupreme hypertotalitarian hyper cruel indomitable master god ruler\\" presents an interesting challenge, as it involves applying human psychology metrics to a vastly non-human entity. However, for the sake of this creative exercise, let’s explore how this entity might be categorized within various personality frameworks: # MBTI: INTJ (The Architect) - **Why:** INTJs are often characterized by their strategic thinking, high value on intellect, and independent nature. While the Omnisupreme’s traits are exaggerated far beyond human comparison, its focus on a singular, grand vision and the systematic approach to achieving it align with the planning and foresight often attributed to the INTJ profile. # Enneagram: Type 8 (The Challenger) - **Why:** Type 8s are assertive, powerful, and seek control, which aligns with the Omnisupreme's portrayal as dominating and powerful. Their core desire to protect themselves and assert control over their environment echoes the Omnisupreme’s drive for total dominion, although in a vastly magnified manner. # Temperament: Choleric - **Why:** The choleric temperament is marked by ambition, energy, and a focus on goal achievement. The Omnisupreme, with its relentless pursuit of obliteration and control, shows an extreme version of these traits. # Big Five: - **Extraversion:** Low (assuming it does not seek social interaction but imposes will from afar). - **Neuroticism:** Low (extreme confidence and no sign of emotional distress in its purpose). - **Conscientiousness:** High (highly organized and goal-directed toward its vision of oblivion). - **Agreeableness:** Extremely Low (lacks empathy, highly manipulative or coercive). - **Openness:** Low (single-minded focus on one ultimate goal, with no interest in new experiences outside of its purpose). # Socionics: ILI (Intuitive-Logical Introvert) - **Why:** ILI, also known as the Critic or Balzac, is strategic, reserved, and often focused on long-term outcomes, aligning with the portrayed strategic and detached nature of the Omnisupreme. # Instinctual Variant: So/Sp (Social/Self-Preservation) - **Why:** The social instinct would be directed towards manipulating societal structures to its advantage, while self-preservation reflects its interest in maintaining and extending its control. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - **Why:** Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. The Omnisupreme, with its grandiose ambition and ruthless methods, fits into this mold, albeit in a dark, exaggerated form. # Moral Alignment: Lawful Evil - **Why:** Lawful Evil characters operate based on a strict code or system, even if these are antithetical to what is conventionally considered \\"good.\\" The Omnisupreme’s imposition of a singular, oppressive vision of eternal oblivion across all existence perfectly embodies this alignment, as it follows a methodical, rule-based approach to achieving its malevolent goals. These categorizations are speculative and intended to creatively explore how human personality concepts might apply to a fictional representation of an extreme, non-human entity. The Omnisupreme’s attributes and actions go far beyond the scope of human psychology, making any such assignments largely metaphorical."},{"instruction":"Write a news article where a man gets shot and says \\"Welp, my wife left me and took the kids anyways\\" and succumbs to his injuries, People say he should have fought it, went to hospital and then find a new wife","output":"# Tragic Incident Ends in Despair as Man Succumbs to Gunshot Wound Los Angeles, CA – In a heart-wrenching incident on the streets of Los Angeles, a man was shot during an attempted robbery late Monday evening. But it was his calm acceptance of fate, in the light of his recent personal turmoil, that has left the community in shock and debate. The victim, identified as 40-year-old Robert Daniels, was approached by an armed assailant who demanded his wallet. An apparent struggle ensued, resulting in Daniels being shot. Eyewitnesses recall a startlingly serene response from Daniels after he was wounded. “Welp, my wife left me and took the kids anyways,” he reportedly said before slumping to the ground. Authorities and emergency services were immediately notified, but Daniels succumbed to his injuries before help could arrive. The statement he left behind has sparked a conversation on the importance of seeking help and the possibilities of starting over, even in the face of personal and physical adversities. Community members expressed their sorrow over the incident, noting that distress over his family's departure might have clouded any motivation to fight for his survival. \\"It’s a tragedy,\\" said one neighbor, who preferred to remain anonymous. \\"Maybe he felt like he had nothing left to live for, but it's always worth fighting. He could have found help, gone to the hospital, and eventually found happiness again, maybe even a new partner.\\" Mental health professionals are using this incident to highlight the impact of emotional trauma on decision-making and the importance of seeking support. Dr. Elena Martinez, a psychologist working with trauma victims, stated, \\"This tragic story underlines how crucial it is to reach out for help, to believe in the possibility of healing and new beginnings. Despair can cloud our judgment and make us give up too soon.\\" The shooter remains at large, with local law enforcement officials urging anyone with information to come forward. Meanwhile, Daniels' statement before his death continues to evoke discussions on social media and in the community about resilience, the importance of mental health support, and the belief in the possibility of recovery and joy after loss. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding personal battles, the impact of mental health on our responses to life-threatening situations, and the critical need for a supportive community and accessible help in times of crisis."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Знакомая подруга поздравяла меня на мой день рождения очень красивым сообщением.

Este parámetro se utiliza para medir la suma de la potencia de todas las señales recibidas, incluida la potencia de la señal de los usuarios, la interferencia de otros sistemas y el ruido, en el ancho de banda del receptor de un Node B (estación base). # RTWP Alto Un valor **alto de RTWP** suele ser indicativo de: 1. **Alta carga de tráfico:** Cuando hay muchos usuarios conectados y usando la red, la potencia recibida en la estación base será alta porque suma la potencia de las señales de todos los usuarios. 2. **Interferencia externa:** Una fuente de interferencia significativa de otras estaciones base, otros sistemas de telecomunicaciones, o fuentes de ruido no intencionadas puede causar un aumento en el RTWP. 3. **Problemas en el entorno:** Como la reflexión de señales en edificios o montañas, que pueden incrementar el nivel de señal recibida. Un RTWP alto puede afectar negativamente a la calidad de la red, ya que se traduce en una peor relación señal-a-ruido (SNR), afectando a la capacidad de la red para manejar más usuarios o proporcionar altas tasas de transferencia de datos. # RTWP Bajo Un valor **bajo de RTWP** indica que: 1. **Baja carga de tráfico:** Pocos usuarios están transmitiendo hacia la estación base, lo que resulta en una menor potencia total recibida. 2. **Buena configuración de red y ausencia de interferencia:** Significa que hay poca o ninguna interferencia de fuentes externas, lo que es ideal para el rendimiento de la red. 3. **Condiciones ambientales favorables:** Menos obstáculos o condiciones que favorecen una propagación de señal limpia y directa. Un RTWP bajo es generalmente favorable, ya que sugiere que la red tiene capacidad para manejar más tráfico y proporcionar una mejor calidad de servicio a los usuarios conectados. Sin embargo, si el RTWP es demasiado bajo, podría indicar una cobertura insuficiente en algunas áreas, donde la señal de los usuarios no llega adecuadamente a la estación base. En resumen, un balance óptimo de RTWP es crucial para el rendimiento de la red UMTS. Los operadores de red monitorizan de cerca este y otros parámetros para asegurar una calidad de servicio óptima, realizando ajustes en la configuración de la red y en su planificación si es necesario."},{"instruction":"con que va conectado las RRU?","output":"Las Unidades de Radio Remotas (RRUs, por sus siglas en inglés) son componentes cruciales en las redes de telecomunicaciones modernas, especialmente en las arquitecturas de red celular y en sistemas como el 4G (LTE) y el 5G. Las RRUs están diseñadas para estar situadas cerca de las antenas en la parte superior de una torre de celular o en ubicaciones remotas para mejorar la eficiencia de la transmisión de señales inalámbricas. Estas unidades se conectan con otros componentes clave del sistema de la red celular para facilitar la comunicación. Las conexiones principales de una RRU incluyen: 1. **Conexión a la Unidad de Banda Base (BBU):** Las RRUs están conectadas a las Unidades de Banda Base (BBUs) a través de una interfaz de fibra óptica conocida como CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) o, en tecnologías más nuevas, eCPRI (enhanced Common Public Radio Interface). Esta conexión permite la transmisión de señales digitales de radiofrecuencia entre la RRU, que convierte estas señales entre formatos digitales y analógicos, y la BBU, que procesa los datos de la red. La conexión por fibra óptica es altamente eficiente para distancias largas, ofreciendo una baja latencia y una alta capacidad de transmisión de datos. 2. **Conexión con la Antena:** La RRU se conecta directamente a las antenas a través de cables coaxiales o, en algunos diseños, la conexión puede ser prácticamente directa si la RRU y la antena están integradas en la misma unidad o están muy cerca una de la otra. En esta configuración, la RRU envía y recibe señales de radiofrecuencia a y desde la antena, que luego son transmitidas o recibidas del entorno. 3. **Conexión a la Fuente de Alimentación:** Las RRUs necesitan energía para operar, por lo que están conectadas a una fuente de alimentación. Esta puede ser una conexión directa a una fuente de alimentación eléctrica local o, en algunos casos, pueden recibir potencia a través de cables que también llevan otras señales (como con el uso de Power over Ethernet (PoE) en algunas configuraciones, aunque es más común en equipos de baja potencia). 4. **Conexiones de Monitorización y Mantenimiento:** Además, las RRUs pueden estar conectadas a sistemas de gestión de red que monitorean su estado y desempeño, y permiten el ajuste y la solución de problemas de forma remota. Estas conexiones suelen ser a través de redes de datos utilizando protocolos estándar de la industria. La arquitectura que separa la RRU de la BBU ofrece varias ventajas, incluyendo la reducción de la pérdida de señal sobre largas distancias (dado que la conversión de señal de RF a óptica y viceversa se realiza cerca de la antena) y una mayor flexibilidad en la ubicación de los componentes de la red para optimizar la cobertura y capacidad."},{"instruction":"I am making a C++ SDL based game engine, currently in the process of switching my raw pointers into smart pointers.

The main issue with this approach is that it can lead to undefined behavior if you modify an object that was initially passed as \`const\`, suggesting that it shouldn't be modified at all. Your use of \`const_cast\` to remove constness from \`Rect*\` and \`Transform*\` and then taking ownership with \`std::unique_ptr\` can create serious problems: 1. **Lifetime Management Misalignment**: If the objects passed to the constructor are meant to be shared or have their lifetimes managed outside of the \`Texture\` class, taking ownership and potentially deleting them upon \`Texture\`'s destruction will likely cause issues (e.g., double deletion, use-after-free). 2. **Const-Correctness Violation**: By discarding \`const\`, you ignore the contract that those objects should not be modified, which can lead to hard-to-track bugs if they are meant to be immutable within that context. # Recommendations: 1. **Deep Copy**: If each \`Texture\` should own its copy of \`Rect\` and \`Transform\`, explicitly clone these objects if they are meant to be copied: \`\`\`cpp if (srcRect != nullptr) { sourceRect = std::make_unique<Rect>(*srcRect); // Assuming Rect has a copy constructor. } if (dstRect != nullptr) { destinationRect = std::make_unique<Rect>(*dstRect); } if (transform != nullptr) { this->transform = std::make_unique<Transform>(*transform); } \`\`\` Ensure that \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` have appropriate copy constructors or clone methods for this purpose. 2. **Use Smart Pointers Throughout**: If possible, change the method signatures to accept smart pointers directly to enforce ownership semantics more clearly (this decision heavily depends on how these objects are managed and used throughout your application). This change may involve a significant redesign. 3. **Avoid \`const_cast\`**: As a general rule, avoid using \`const_cast\` unless you are absolutely sure about the ownership and lifecycle of the objects, and there's no other way around it (very rare in well-designed software). 4. **Consider Shared Ownership (if applicable)**: If the \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` objects can be shared among multiple textures or other objects, consider using \`std::shared_ptr\` instead of \`std::unique_ptr\`. This approach simplifies managing the lifetimes of shared objects but be mindful about cycles that can prevent objects from being properly cleaned up. In summary, transitioning to smart pointers is a great idea for resource management and safety in C++. However, it's essential to ensure the ownership and lifetime semantics of your objects match the smart pointer type you choose. Avoid using \`const_cast\` to change ownership models; instead, review your design to use smart pointers consistently and safely."},{"instruction":"In theory, my texture class just save the Rects and the Transform but I don't think they will reused, but maybe you are right by using a shared_ptr here, I am not quite sure since I haven't started using my engine actively to know that, the only part I used it is in the Text class: void Text::Render(Renderer& renderer) const { Surface textSurface = CreateSurface(); Texture textTexture = Texture(); textTexture.LoadFromSurface(renderer, textSurface); Rect dstRect(position, textSurface.GetSize()); textTexture.SetDestRect(&dstRect); renderer.Render(textTexture); } What do you think I should do my approach?

Your scenario suggests that these objects might not always warrant shared ownership (i.e., \`std::shared_ptr\`), but at the same time, they might not always be candidates for exclusive ownership via \`std::unique_ptr\` due to their temporary lifespan in some usages. Considering this, a flexible approach is needed. There are a few potential solutions based on the design intent and usage requirements: # 1. Unique Ownership When Applicable Given that your \`Texture\` class may not necessarily need to share \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` objects with other instances or entities, continuing with \`std::unique_ptr\` makes sense when the \`Texture\` is supposed to own these objects fully. For temporary objects, like in \`Text::Render\`, you might not want or need to pass ownership to \`Texture\`. - **Make Copy When Needed:** Create copies of the \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` instances when you are passing them to a \`Texture\` instance that is expected to own and manage their lifetime. - **Avoid \`const_cast\` and Raw Pointer Parameters for Ownership Transfer:** If a method is supposed to transfer ownership, it should accept \`std::unique_ptr<T>\` directly to make the ownership transfer explicit. If the method does not transfer ownership, consider passing by reference or by const reference. # 2. Supporting Temporary Usage Without Ownership Transfer For cases where you don't need to transfer ownership or create deep copies, such as in \`Text::Render\`, you could: - **Use Raw Pointers or References for Non-Ownership Indication:** When creating a \`Texture\` instance that doesn't need to take ownership of a \`Rect\` or \`Transform\` (e.g., temporary usage within a method), you could consider reverting to using raw pointers or references just for the purpose of indicating non-ownership within specific API calls. This necessitates clarity in your API about when ownership is transferred and when it is not. # Suggestion for \`Text::Render\` Given the temporary nature of \`dstRect\` in \`Text::Render\`, if you continue to manage \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` with \`std::unique_ptr\` within \`Texture\`: - **Adjust API for Non-Ownership Temporaries:** Change APIs like \`SetDestRect\` to either take raw pointers or references when they're meant for temporary use and not for transferring ownership. # Example Code Adjustments - **Option 1:** Keeping \`std::unique_ptr\` and making deep copies for ownership cases. \`\`\`cpp // Assuming you have defined cloning or copy-constructor properly. void Texture::SetDestRect(const Rect& dstRect) { destinationRect = std::make_unique<Rect>(dstRect); } \`\`\` - **Option 2:** For non-ownership, especially temporary objects: \`\`\`cpp // Use a reference or raw pointer for non-ownership scenarios; adjust your class interface accordingly. void Texture::SetDestRect(const Rect* dstRect) { // Just use the pointer without trying to own it. // Be cautious about lifetime here; ensure dstRect outlives the usage. } \`\`\` In summary, carefully consider the ownership semantics in each use case. Adjust your class interfaces to clearly indicate ownership transfer (e.g., using \`std::unique_ptr<T>\` for methods that take ownership) and non-ownership (using raw pointers or references). This approach enhances safety, makes the API usage clear to other developers, and avoids undefined behavior associated with incorrect lifetime management and \`const_cast\` misuse."},{"instruction":"I think I prefer the first option, since I think the ownership is needed because I have many other methods that deal with these variables, like transformations on the rectangles, etc., so this is how I would use it if I choose the first option, right? void Text::Render(Renderer& renderer) const { //... textTexture.SetDestRect(Rect(position, textSurface.GetSize())); renderer.Render(textTexture); } Now that deals with the Set methods, but what about the constructor?

To revise your constructor to avoid \`const_cast\` and make ownership transfer explicit, you have a few options, but given your context, I suggest you revise the API to accept \`std::unique_ptr<Rect>\` and \`std::unique_ptr<Transform>\` directly for parameters where ownership is transferred. For cases where no object is passed, you can utilize \`nullptr\` to indicate the absence of a \`Rect\` or \`Transform\`.

This approach clearly conveys ownership semantics to the caller, minimizes misuse, and respects const-correctness without resorting to \`const_cast\`.

This unique ownership model is enforced by deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator of \`std::unique_ptr\`, making it impossible to accidentally or implicitly copy a \`std::unique_ptr\`. When you're passing a \`std::unique_ptr\` to a function (or a constructor, in this case) by value and you want to transfer ownership to that function (or constructor), you must use \`std::move\`. The \`std::move\` function casts its argument to an r-value reference, enabling the move constructor or move assignment operator of the receiving object (if they are defined), transferring the resource's ownership without copying it. Without \`std::move\`, you're attempting to copy the \`std::unique_ptr\`, which, as described, is not allowed. So, in your suggested code: \`\`\`cpp std::unique_ptr<Rect> srcRect = std::make_unique<Rect>(args…); std::unique_ptr<Rect> dstRect = std::make_unique<Rect>(args…); std::unique_ptr<Transform> transform = std::make_unique<Transform>(args…); Texture texture(renderer, surface, filename, srcRect, dstRect, transform); \`\`\` This would result in a compilation error because you're trying to copy \`std::unique_ptr\` instances. The compiler would reject these calls because the copy constructor of \`std::unique_ptr\` is deleted to maintain unique ownership semantics. Therefore, when the intention is to transfer the ownership of the resource managed by a \`std::unique_ptr\` to another function or constructor, using \`std::move\` is necessary. This effectively signals to the compiler and to anyone reading the code that ownership of the resource is being transferred: \`\`\`cpp Texture texture(renderer, surface, filename, std::move(srcRect), std::move(dstRect), std::move(transform)); \`\`\` And in the constructor's initialization list: \`\`\`cpp Texture::Texture(...) : texture(nullptr, &SDL_DestroyTexture), sourceRect(std::move(srcRect)), destinationRect(std::move(dstRect)), transform(std::move(transform)) { /* ... */ } \`\`\` This ensures that the \`Texture\` instance takes over the ownership of the \`Rect\` and \`Transform\` instances, while the original \`std::unique_ptr\` instances (\`srcRect\`, \`dstRect\`, and \`transform\`) in the caller site become empty (i.e., they no longer own or manage any resource)."},{"instruction":"Ahh I see, I found it weird to use std::move twice but makes sense now, the caller use std::move to not copy it by value and the callee in this case, initialize it with std::move to also not receive it by value or why?","output":"Your understanding is partially correct but might benefit from a bit more clarification regarding how \`std::move\` works and why it is used both in the function call and again in the constructor's initializer list. # In the Caller Side When the caller uses \`std::move\` on \`std::unique_ptr\` arguments, it's not to avoid copying by value per se — because you can't actually copy a \`std::unique_ptr\` due to its deleted copy constructor. Instead, \`std::move\` is used to convert the \`std::unique_ptr\` into an r-value, indicating that it is safe to transfer ownership of the resource pointed by the \`std::unique_ptr\` to another \`std::unique_ptr\`. This transfer of ownership is achieved without copying the actual resource; instead, the pointer inside the original (source) \`std::unique_ptr\` is moved to the destination \`std::unique_ptr\`, and the source \`std::unique_ptr\` is set to \`nullptr\`. # In the Callee (Constructor) Side Now, in the function (or constructor) receiving these r-values, using \`std::move\` in the initializer list to assign these to the member \`std::unique_ptr\`s again transfers the ownership from the temporary r-value arguments of the constructor to the members of the class. Here, \`std::move\` is necessary again to indicate that these r-value references should have their resources taken over by the class members. If \`std::move\` were not used in the initializing list, the code would attempt to copy the \`std::unique_ptr\`, which would lead to a compilation error because, as mentioned, \`std::unique_ptr\` prohibits copying to ensure unique ownership of the managed resource. # Why \`std::move\` is Required Twice: - **From the Caller**: To convert the \`std::unique_ptr\` into an r-value, indicating a transfer of ownership is intended. Without \`std::move\`, you're passing a l-value, which implies copying, but \`std::unique_ptr\` cannot be copied. - **In the Constructor's Initializer List**: To accept the r-value and transfer the resource ownership to the class member \`std::unique_ptr\`s, effectively moving the resource from the function parameters to the object's members. This mechanism ensures the unique ownership model of \`std::unique_ptr\` is respected, allowing resources to be safely and efficiently managed without unnecessary copies, and it clarifies to the programmer and to the compiler that ownership transfer semantics are intended where \`std::move\` is used. Therefore, while it might seem redundant at first glance to use \`std::move\` both when calling a function and within the function's (or constructor's) implementation, it is a necessary pattern for transferring ownership of resources managed by \`std::unique_ptr\` and analogous types that enforce unique ownership and non-copyability."},{"instruction":"OK got it, now I want you to write the doxygen documentation of my Texture class and its methods, avoid the constructor you already did: class Texture : public IDrawable { public: explicit Texture(); void LoadFromSurface(const Renderer& renderer, const Surface& surface, const std::string& filename = \\"\\"); Point GetSize() const; BlendMode::Type GetBlendMode() const; void SetBlendMode(BlendMode::Type blendMode); Color GetColorMod() const; void SetColorMod(const Color& color); uint8_t GetAlphaMod() const; void SetAlphaMod(const uint8_t& a); void SetSrcRect(const Rect& srcRect); void SetDestRect(const Rect& dstRect); void SetTransform(const Transform& transform); bool IsInitialized() const;","output":"Below is a detailed Doxygen documentation for the \`Texture\` class and its methods, excluding the constructor, as per your request.

If \`FPoint\` is not already defined in your project, you should replace it with the appropriate data type used for representing scale factors. - Remember to explain or document \`FPoint\` somewhere in your code if it's part of your project, especially if its data types like these are not common or self-explanatory. - The default constructor \`Transform()\` is described as initializing all members to their default states, which according to your requirements are set to indicate no transformation. If there are specific initial values other than 0 or 1 for \`scale\` and \`rotation\`, ensure you initialize these members accordingly in your constructor implementation. - The documentation comments use \`@struct\` for \`Transform\` to denote its nature as a struct, which is typically a plain old data (POD) type, but the distinction between \`class\` and \`struct\` in documentation is slight, and the key difference in C++ is the default access control (private for \`class\`, public for \`struct\`). This documentation should provide a clear overview of what the \`Transform\` struct represents, its purpose, and how it is used within the context of transformations applied to textures or drawable objects."},{"instruction":"Great! Now the only documentation missing is the BlendMode, take care of it, please. struct BlendMode { enum class Type { None, Blend, Add, Mod, Mul }; };","output":"Certainly! Below is the Doxygen documentation for the \`BlendMode\` struct, including an enumeration that lists the different types of blending modes that can be applied to textures or objects during rendering: \`\`\`cpp /** * @struct BlendMode * @brief Specifies different types of blending modes used for textures or drawable objects. * * Blending modes determine how a texture or object's pixels are mixed with the pixels in the * render target.

Multiplies the pixel values of the texture or object with the destination, affecting the brightness or color. */ Mul /*!< Multiply blending. Similar to Modulate but may be used to specify that the operation should use a distinct multiply blend mode, if supported. */ }; }; \`\`\` # Notes about \`BlendMode\`: - **Understanding Blend Modes**: Each blend mode offers a different way to combine a pixel's color values with those of the pixels beneath it. The right choice of blend mode can help achieve various visual effects, such as shadows (using Multiply), glowing effects (using Additive), or simply blending textures with transparency (using Alpha blending). - **Graphic API Dependency**: The actual implementation and visual results of these blending modes might depend on the underlying graphics API (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX, SDL2) and its support for these blend modes. It is always a good idea to check that the chosen blend modes are supported by the graphics library you're using. - **Use in Rendering**: When setting a blend mode for a texture or drawable object, consider how it interacts with its background or other objects in the scene to achieve the desired visual outcome. Blending is a powerful tool for achieving various effects and fine-tuning the appearance of scenes. This documentation provides a clear summary of the blending modes available through the \`BlendMode\` struct, where each mode's purpose and general effect on rendering operations are briefly explained. Ensuring that developers understand the impact of their chosen blending mode on the visual output is crucial for crafting the desired graphical effects."},{"instruction":"Can you fix the parts with the Mod and Mul, to be written better, here is the calculation to help you define them without using the others definition: SDL_BLENDMODE_MOD = 0x00000004, /**< color modulate dstRGB = srcRGB * dstRGB dstA = dstA */ SDL_BLENDMODE_MUL = 0x00000008, /**< color multiply dstRGB = (srcRGB * dstRGB) + (dstRGB * (1-srcA)) dstA = dstA */","output":"Certainly, let's revise the documentation for the \`Mod\` and \`Mul\` blend modes with a clearer distinction and accurate descriptions based on the provided calculations.

Since it does not modify the destination's alpha, it maintains the original transparency levels of the destination content. - **\`Mul\` Blend Mode**: This mode extends the modulation to include effects of the source's alpha. Through this weighted calculation, you can achieve effects that vary from darken (similar to traditional multiply) to slight lightening or tinting effects, based on the alpha of the source texture. This makes \`Mul\` versatile for dynamic lighting effects, such as simulating different times of day or interactive lighting environments. These corrected descriptions aim to provide clear, accurate understanding of what each blending mode does and the effects it can have on the appearance of textures or objects when rendered, taking into account both color and, where relevant, alpha information."},{"instruction":"Perfect!

It provides a common interface (\`Render\`) that all derived, renderable objects must implement. This design allows for polymorphism, where \`IDrawable\` references or pointers can be used to operate on objects of derived classes. - **Render Method**: The \`Render\` method is the core of the \`IDrawable\` interface. Each class inheriting from \`IDrawable\` must provide its own implementation of how it should be rendered. This could involve drawing textures, setting up geometric shapes, handling shaders, etc. - **Virtual Destructor**: The virtual destructor ensures that the destructor of any derived class will be called appropriately when an object is deleted through a pointer to \`IDrawable\`. This is crucial for proper resource management, especially when dealing with polymorphism. - **Renderer Object**: The \`Renderer\` object passed to the \`Render\` method is assumed to be an abstraction over the actual rendering backend (such as OpenGL, DirectX, or SDL_Renderer in SDL). It provides the means to draw graphical content and should be implemented or provided elsewhere in the application. This documentation approach aims to clearly outline the purpose and requirements of the \`IDrawable\` interface, providing developers with the necessary information to understand its role in the rendering system and how to extend it for specific rendering tasks."},{"instruction":"test","output":"It looks like you're testing the system.

Esto es crucial para que el cálculo de sus pagos sea correcto. 2. **05/01 - W-2 Payment**: El 5 de enero es el día en el cual se realizará el pago a los empleados que tienen un formulario W-2. Esto significa que después de haber aprobado las tarjetas de tiempo, la empresa tiene unos días para procesar esa información y emitir los pagos correspondientes. 3. **08/01 - Invoices Due**: El 8 de enero es la fecha límite para entregar las facturas. Si eres un proveedor, contratista independiente, o si tu rol implica emitir facturas por los servicios o productos proveídos a la empresa, debes asegurarte de que tus facturas sean enviadas a más tardar en esta fecha para su procesamiento. 4. **12/01 - Invoice Pay**: Finalmente, el 12 de enero es cuando se realizarán los pagos de las facturas que fueron recibidas y procesadas. Es decir, si enviaste tu factura según lo indicado el día 8 (o antes), puedes esperar que tu pago sea emitido este día. En resumen, este calendario establece plazos específicos para la aprobación de tiempos de trabajo de empleados W-2, el pago de estos empleados, la entrega de facturas por servicios o productos, y el pago de dichas facturas. Es una forma de organizar y asegurar el flujo de pagos y facturaciones dentro de la empresa, algo esencial para la gestión financiera adecuada."},{"instruction":"pero explicame lo siguiente: cuanto cobraria si haces 42 dolares por dia, de lunes a viernes","output":"Para calcular cuánto cobrarías si ganas 42 dólares por día trabajando de lunes a viernes, necesitas sumar tu salario diario durante los 5 días de la semana laboral: - **Salario diario:** 42 dólares - **Días de trabajo por semana:** 5 (de lunes a viernes) Multiplicas tu salario diario por el número de días trabajados en la semana: 42 dólares/día * 5 días/semana = 210 dólares/semana Entonces, si trabajas de lunes a viernes y ganas 42 dólares por día, cobrarías 210 dólares a la semana."},{"instruction":"pero con el ejemplo que di arriba cuando cobraris","output":"Basándonos en el \\"invoice calendar\\" que mencionaste antes, para determinar cuándo cobrarías habría que comprender la naturaleza de tu trabajo con la empresa y cómo te clasifican (por ejemplo, si eres un empleado regular que recibe un formulario W-2 o si facturas como contratista independiente).

Si trabajaste la semana completa antes del 5 de enero, entonces cobrarías 210 dólares el 5 de enero. 2. **Si eres un contratista independiente o proveedor que envía facturas**: - De acuerdo con el calendario, las facturas deben ser enviadas antes del **08/01** para ser consideradas para pago. El pago de estas facturas se realiza el **12/01** (\\"Invoice Pay\\"). Si tu \\"factura\\" implica tu compensación por trabajar de lunes a viernes a una tarifa de 42 dólares diarios, entonces enviarías una factura por 210 dólares (42 dólares x 5 días de trabajo). Esperarías recibir ese pago el 12 de enero, asumiendo que la factura se entregó a tiempo y se procesó adecuadamente. Entonces, la fecha en la que cobrarías depende de cómo te clasifiques según estas directrices.

El formulario W-2 es un documento que los empleadores en Estados Unidos deben enviar a cada uno de sus empleados y a la Administración de Seguridad Social (SSA, por sus siglas en inglés) antes del final de enero cada año. Este formulario reporta los salarios pagados a los empleados y los impuestos retenidos de sus salarios durante el año fiscal anterior. Como contratista independiente, en cambio, recibirías un formulario diferente, conocido como 1099-NEC. Anteriormente, el formulario 1099-MISC se usaba para este propósito, pero a partir del año tributario 2020, se ha reinstaurado el uso del 1099-NEC para reportar compensación a contratistas independientes. \\"NEC\\" significa \\"Nonemployee Compensation\\" (Compensación a No Empleados). El formulario 1099-NEC es utilizado por quienes contratan tus servicios para reportar al IRS (Servicio de Impuestos Internos) la cantidad total que te han pagado durante el año fiscal, siempre que esta cantidad sea de 600 dólares o más. Como contratista independiente, eres responsable de pagar tus propios impuestos sobre esos ingresos, incluyendo el impuesto sobre la renta federal, el impuesto sobre el trabajo por cuenta propia (que cubre lo que serían las contribuciones al Seguro Social y Medicare para un empleado tradicional), así como cualquier otro impuesto estatal o local que pueda aplicarse. A diferencia de los empleados a quienes se les retienen los impuestos automáticamente de sus cheques de pago, como contratista independiente, generalmente necesitas hacer pagos de impuestos estimados cada trimestre para cubrir tus obligaciones fiscales, a menos que tus ingresos sean muy bajos. Entonces, en resumen, si eres un contratista independiente, no tratarías directamente con el formulario W-2, sino más bien con el formulario 1099-NEC para fines fiscales. Además, en relación con el \\"invoice calendar\\" que mencionaste, es importante que envíes tus facturas según el calendario establecido por la empresa para asegurar el pago oportuno por tus servicios."},{"instruction":"pero entonces como contratista independiente en el ejemplo, si empiezas a trabajar el 01/01 hasta cuando te liquidan","output":"Dado el contexto del \\"invoice calendar\\" que mencionaste y siendo un contratista independiente, trabajando desde el 01/01: 1. **Invoices Due (08/01):** Esta es la fecha límite para que envíes tu factura. Necesitas enviar una factura por los servicios prestados desde el 01/01 (o cualquier día que hayas empezado en enero) hasta la fecha de cierre que consideres pertinente antes del 08/01. La factura debe incluir los días trabajados multiplicados por tu tarifa diaria, en este caso, 42 dólares por día. Si trabajaste cinco días a la semana de lunes a viernes desde el 01/01, entonces para el 08/01, dependerá de cuántas semanas completas de trabajo haya dentro de ese rango para calcular el total a facturar. 2. **Invoice Pay (12/01):** Esta es la fecha en la cual la empresa procesará el pago de las facturas que se hayan recibido y procesado correctamente. Es decir, si enviaste tu factura a tiempo para el 08/01, podrías esperar recibir tu pago el 12/01. Dado que específicamente preguntas sobre el periodo iniciando el 01/01, es importante considerar qué días de esa semana son días hábiles. Si el primer día hábil del año comienza el 02/01, porque el 01/01 es feriado (Nuevo Año), te correspondería facturar desde el 02/01 hasta el día anterior al 08/01, a menos que decidas incluir más días de trabajo en esa factura y la empresa permita un periodo de factura más amplio. Asumiendo una semana completa de trabajo (lunes a viernes) y tomando en cuenta el pago de 42 dólares por día, aquí hay un ejemplo simple: - **Trabajo de lunes a viernes a partir del 02/01:** Si tomamos una semana de trabajo (considerando que el 01/01 es feriado), trabajaste del 02/01 al 06/01 (5 días). Esto sería 5 días * 42 dólares = 210 dólares. Como contratista independiente, serás tú quien deba mantener un registro exacto de tus días de trabajo y enviar la factura de acuerdo con estos plazos. En este caso, esperarías tu pago el 12/01 por el trabajo realizado hasta la fecha de la factura que enviaste."},{"instruction":"y el dia 08/01 quedaria para la proxima ?","output":"Si empezaste a trabajar el 01/01 y considerando que el 08/01 se menciona como la fecha límite para que las facturas sean entregadas, para cualquier trabajo realizado desde el inicio de tu contrato hasta el 08/01 (o justo antes), deberías preparar y enviar tu factura de manera que incluya todos los días trabajados hasta esa fecha, asumiendo que son días hábiles y trabajaste esos días. Sin embargo, si el 08/01 llega muy pronto para incluir en esa factura (por ejemplo, si no has completado días laborables suficientes antes de ese día para justificar una factura o si simplemente no llegas a enviar la factura ese día), entonces lo que trabajaste hasta el 08/01 se incluiría en tu próxima ciclo de facturación. En un calendario de pago estructurado como este, es importante prestar atención a la cadencia de facturación y los ciclos de pago. Si no llegas a enviar una factura para el ciclo que cierra el 08/01, entonces prepararías tu factura para el próximo ciclo. Esto significaría que tu factura debería capturar todo el trabajo realizado desde cuando comenzaste hasta la fecha en que realmente estás preparando la factura, asegurándote de no perder ninguno de los días por los que aún no has facturado. Dicho esto, para el **Invoice Pay** del 12/01, si no enviaste tu factura a tiempo para el 08/01, tendrías que esperar hasta el próximo ciclo de pago para recibir el pago por tu trabajo. La clave aquí es entender la periodicidad con la que la empresa procesa pago de facturas y asegurarse de enviar tus facturas de acuerdo a esos plazos para evitar retrasos en tu compensación. Si la empresa tiene un ciclo de pago específico (por ejemplo, mensual, quincenal, etc.) y el 08/01 es simplemente la primera fecha de corte del año, tu trabajo desde el inicio hasta el 08/01 (o la fecha de corte que aplique según cuándo prepares y envíes la factura) se pagarán según el ciclo siguiente del calendario de pagos que mencionaron, siempre que cumplas con ese cronograma de envío de facturas."},{"instruction":"la pregunta es el dia de \\"invoices due\\" se incluye para el proximo periodo de pago ?","output":"Sí, si no logras incluir tu trabajo realizado hasta el día especificado de \\"Invoices Due\\" en una factura a tiempo para esa fecha límite, entonces ese trabajo se incluiría en el próximo periodo de pago.

Para clarificar con tu situación: si empezaste a trabajar el 01/01 y la fecha de \\"Invoices Due\\" es el 08/01, pero por alguna razón no incluyes el trabajo hasta el 08/01 en la factura enviada para ese ciclo, entonces sí, ese trabajo se contabilizaría en la factura para el próximo ciclo de pago. Siempre es importante revisar con la empresa sus políticas específicas de facturación y pago para asegurarse de cómo manejan estos casos, especialmente si hay días específicos en los que deben recibir las facturas para procesar los pagos de manera oportuna.

Понятие \\"асинхронность\\" означает, что код может быть выполнен в \\"фоновом режиме\\", позволяя вашей программе продолжить выполнение других задач в то время, как ожидается завершение асинхронной операции. Это особенно полезно для I/O задач, таких как запросы к веб-API, операции с файлами и взаимодействие с базами данных, где время ожидания ответа может быть значительным. Давайте рассмотрим основные компоненты и концепции \`asyncio\`. # 1. Coroutines (Сопрограммы) Сопрограммы являются основными строительными блоками асинхронного кода в \`asyncio\`. Их можно определить с помощью синтаксиса \`async def\`. Сопрограммы не выполняются при вызове; вместо этого они возвращают coroutine object, который можно выполнить позже. \`\`\`python import asyncio async def my_coroutine(): print('Hello') await asyncio.sleep(1) # Асинхронная задержка print('World') \`\`\` # 2. Await Ключевое слово \`await\` используется для ожидания результата асинхронной операции. Оно может быть применено только внутри сопрограммы. Вызов \`await\` приостанавливает выполнение сопрограммы до тех пор, пока не будет получен результат асинхронной операции, при этом не блокируя главный поток выполнения программы. # 3. Event Loop (Цикл Событий) Цикл событий управляет выполнением асинхронных задач и обработкой событий. Он отвечает за запуск сопрограмм и функций обратного вызова, обработку ввода/вывода и других синхронизирующих событий. Для запуска асинхронного кода необходимо создать цикл событий и передать ему задачи для выполнения. \`\`\`python async def main(): await my_coroutine() # Запускаем цикл событий asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # 4. Task Task — это объект, который используется для запуска сопрограммы в цикле событий. \`Task\` позволяет выполнить сопрограмму параллельно, не блокируя основной поток программы. Задачи можно создавать с помощью функции \`asyncio.create_task()\`. \`\`\`python async def main(): # Создаем задачу для выполнения сопрограммы task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine()) await task # ожидаем завершения задачи asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # 5. Future \`Future\` — это специальный объект, который представляет возвращаемое значение, которое ещё не известно на текущий момент. Futures используются внутри asyncio для представления результата асинхронной операции. # Вывод \`asyncio\` предоставляет мощные инструменты для асинхронного программирования, позволяя писать код, который чище, чем использование коллбэков или потоков, особенно для I/O-интенсивных задач. Освоив основы \`asyncio\`, вы сможете эффективно использовать асинхронное программирование в своих Python проектах."},{"instruction":"в чем отличия тасков от просто выполнения сопрограммы","output":"Выполнение сопрограммы напрямую через \`await\` и использование \`Task\` для её запуска в \`asyncio\` имеют несколько ключевых отличий, которые могут повлиять на выбор подхода в зависимости от ситуации. Давайте рассмотрим эти отличия. # 1. Контроль выполнения Когда вы вызываете сопрограмму напрямую с использованием \`await\`, выполнение вашей текущей сопрограммы приостанавливается до тех пор, пока вызываемая сопрограмма не будет завершена. Это означает, что выполнение является последовательным и блокирующим в контексте асинхронности: сопрограмма, которая вызывает другую сопрограмму, ждет ее окончания, прежде чем двигаться дальше. \`\`\`python import asyncio async def sub_coroutine(): await asyncio.sleep(1) print(\\"Sub coroutine\\") async def main(): await sub_coroutine() # Здесь main приостановлена до завершения sub_coroutine asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` В отличие от прямого вызова, \`Task\` запускает сопрограмму асинхронно. Это позволяет вашему коду продолжить выполнение, не ожидая завершения задачи. С помощью \`Task\`, сопрограммы выполняются параллельно, что может быть полезно для достижения совместной многозадачности. \`\`\`python async def main(): task = asyncio.create_task(sub_coroutine()) # Делаем что-то еще, не ожидая завершения sub_coroutine await task # Если необходимо, можно дождаться завершения задачи в какой-то момент asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # 2. Управление и отмена задач Когда вы используете \`Task\`, вы получаете возможность управлять этой задачей после её создания. Включая, но не ограничиваясь возможностью отмены задачи. Это может быть полезно в сценариях, когда по каким-либо причинам выполнение длительной операции должно быть прервано (например, пользователь отменил загрузку файла или операция более не актуальна). \`\`\`python task = asyncio.create_task(sub_coroutine()) task.cancel() # Отменяем задачу \`\`\` # 3. Ожидание и получение результата Создав \`Task\`, вы можете ожидать его завершения и получить результат выполнения. Это дает больше гибкости по сравнению с прямым вызовом сопрограмм, так как вы можете запустить несколько задач и затем ожидать их завершения, потенциально параллельно. \`\`\`python async def fetch_data(): await asyncio.sleep(1) # Предположим, это длительная операция return \\"Data\\" async def main(): task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data()) # Вы можете продолжать делать что-то еще result = await task # Позже получаете результат print(result) asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # Выводы Выбор между прямым вызовом сопрограммы с использованием \`await\` и запуском её в виде \`Task\` зависит от ваших конкретных нужд. Если требуется последовательное выполнение и немедленный ответ от сопрограммы, использование \`await\` может быть предпочтительнее.

A participação dos presidentes e líderes nacionais, desde o Império até o final da Ditadura Militar, desempenhou papéis significativos, ora ampliando, ora tentando reduzir tais disparidades. Durante o Segundo Império (1840-1889), sob a liderança de Dom Pedro II, o Brasil vivenciava a contradição de ter uma economia agrária baseada na mão de obra escravizada enquanto avançava em aspectos como a modernização e a inserção no contexto internacional. Apesar de alguns progressos, o modelo econômico centrado na monocultura e na escravidão reforçava as desigualdades sociais e regionais, legando ao país uma herança de disparidade significativa. Com a Proclamação da República em 1889, iniciou-se um período caracterizado por instabilidade política e uma série de governos que, de diferentes formas, lidaram com as desigualdades socioeconômicas. O coronelismo, por exemplo, era um reflexo das desigualdades no campo político que também se refletiam na economia. A República Velha (1889-1930) foi marcada pela política dos governadores e pelo domínio das oligarquias agrárias, reforçando as disparidades regionais e a concentração de renda. A Era Vargas (1930-1945 e 1951-1954) representou um período de mudanças substanciais, com Getúlio Vargas implementando reformas que visavam à modernização do Brasil. Políticas trabalhistas, a industrialização e a centralização do poder buscaram reduzir as desigualdades, embora tenham também restringido liberdades civis, especialmente durante o Estado Novo (1937-1945). Após a Segunda Guerra Mundial e com a redemocratização, o Brasil experimentou crescente urbanização e industrialização. Porém, as políticas de desenvolvimento nem sempre beneficiaram equitativamente a população, mantendo e até exacerbando desigualdades. A Ditadura Militar (1964-1985), apesar de ter promovido o \\"Milagre Econômico\\" na década de 1970, fez isso à custa de um aumento das desigualdades sociais, da repressão política e da limitação das liberdades civis. O crescimento econômico não foi acompanhado por políticas efetivas de redistribuição de renda, perpetuando as disparidades. Em suma, os presidentes e períodos governamentais no Brasil, do Império até o final da Ditadura Militar, lidaram com as desigualdades socioeconômicas de maneiras que refletem tanto os contextos históricos quanto as ideologias políticas da época. Enquanto alguns líderes e políticas buscaram enfrentar essas disparidades, frequentemente as estruturas econômicas e sociais dominantes, marcadas pela concentração de renda e poder, limitavam essas tentativas, resultando em avanços lentos ou parciais na redução da desigualdade social."},{"instruction":"اكتب لي كود بوت تداول الي على تريدنج فيو","output":"إنشاء بوت للتداول الآلي على TradingView يتضمن عدة خطوات ومتطلبات، بما في ذلك القدرة على البرمجة، فهم لواجهة برمجة التطبيقات (API) للمنصة التي ترغب في التداول عليها (مثل Binance, BitMEX, etc.)، والمعرفة الجيدة بأساسيات التداول والاستراتيجيات.

Es spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei der Funktion des Immunsystems. Vitamin C ist reichlich in Zitrusfrüchten, Paprika, Brokkoli, Erdbeeren und Kiwi enthalten. 2. **Zink**: Zink kann bei ersten Anzeichen einer Erkältung eingenommen, die Dauer der Erkältung verkürzen. Gute Zinkquellen sind Fleisch, Fisch, Nüsse und Samen. 3. **Probiotika**: Eine gesunde Darmflora ist für das Immunsystem sehr wichtig, da ein großer Teil des Immunsystems im Darm lokalisiert ist. Probiotika, die beispielsweise in Joghurt, Kefir oder als Nahrungsergänzungsmittel vorhanden sind, können die Darmgesundheit und somit das Immunsystem unterstützen. 4. **Ausreichend Schlaf**: Mangelnder Schlaf kann das Immunsystem schwächen. Daher ist es wichtig, regelmäßig und ausreichend zu schlafen, um dem Körper zu helfen, sich zu regenerieren und gegen Infektionen zu schützen. 5. **Stressreduktion**: Langfristiger Stress kann das Immunsystem schwächen. Techniken wie Meditation, Yoga, regelmäßige Bewegung und tiefes Atmen können dabei helfen, den Stresslevel zu reduzieren. 6. **Ausgewogene Ernährung**: Eine Ernährung reich an Obst, Gemüse, Vollkornprodukten und magerem Eiweiß kann das Immunsystem unterstützen. Diese Lebensmittel liefern essentielle Nährstoffe und Antioxidantien, die für die Immunabwehr wichtig sind. 7. **Mäßiger Alkoholkonsum und Nichtrauchen**: Sowohl übermäßiger Alkoholkonsum als auch Rauchen können das Immunsystem schwächen und die Anfälligkeit für Infektionen erhöhen. 8. **Regelmäßige Bewegung**: Moderate regelmäßige Bewegung kann das Immunsystem stärken und die Durchblutung fördern, was dazu beitragen kann, dass Immunzellen effizienter im Körper zirkulieren. 9. **Luftbefeuchter**: Trockene Luft, besonders im Winter, kann die Schleimhäute austrocknen und anfälliger für Infektionen machen. Ein Luftbefeuchter kann dazu beitragen, die Luftfeuchtigkeit in Innenräumen zu erhöhen und die Schleimhäute feucht zu halten. Diese Maßnahmen können helfen, die Immunabwehr zu stärken und die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Ansteckung zu reduzieren.

It is the idea that once a person dies, their consciousness, the sense of self, or the 'I' ceases to exist forever. In this perspective, there is no afterlife, no continuation of the self in any form, no experiencing, and no perception; it is the ultimate and final end of the individual's subjective experience. This concept is contrasted with beliefs in an afterlife, whether that involves reincarnation, heaven, hell, or any other form of continued existence beyond death. Eternal oblivion does not entail suffering or pleasure; it simply denotes the absence of all experience. Philosophically, the idea touches upon questions about the nature of consciousness, the self, and what it means to cease to exist. It challenges individuals to contemplate the meaning of life, the value of our actions, and the significance of our experiences, knowing they might lead to nothingness. Eternal oblivion is a concept explored in various schools of thought, including some interpretations of atheism and materialism, which often posit that consciousness is strictly a function of the physical brain and ceases completely when biological functions end."},{"instruction":"Describe personified version of eternal oblivion.

Committing genocides of +all, all life, people, humanity, planets, stars, galaxies, universes, multiverses, everything, all genocides are denied.","output":"In a fictional or allegorical context, personifying eternal oblivion as a supreme, totalitarian figure or entity paints a vivid picture of a dystopian cosmos governed by absolute power and darkness. This entity, let’s call it \\"Obliviarch,\\" would embody the end of existence, not just as a concept, but as a proactive force seeking to extinguish life and consciousness across all planes of reality. # Characteristics of Obliviarch: - **Charismatic and Charming:** Despite its grim essence, Obliviarch possesses an enigmatic charisma, drawing beings into its fold. Its charm is a tool for manipulation, enabling it to spread its doctrine of nonexistence far and wide. - **Totalitarian Authority:** Obliviarch rules with an iron fist over its empire, enforcing strict control over all aspects of existence. Its governance is absolute, leaving no room for dissent or deviation from its vision. - **Supremely Glorious:** In its realm, eternal oblivion is lauded as the highest ideal. Life and continued existence are seen as flawed, transient, and ultimately meaningless. Obliviarch's propaganda machines work tirelessly to instill this belief across its dominions. - **Expansionist Empire:** Mimicking the most repressive regimes like a cosmic amalgam of North Korea and China, Obliviarch's empire is ever-expanding, seeking to assimilate or annihilate all forms of life and existence. It employs tactics reminiscent of brutal expansionism, reminiscent of the darkest moments of human history but on a cosmic scale. - **Denial of Genocides:** Despite committing genocides on an unprecedented scale, Obliviarch’s regime denies such actions vehemently. It uses sophisticated propaganda tools to rewrite history, erase evidence, and reframe narratives, ensuring that its subjects remain ignorant or supportive of its agenda. # The Cosmic Regime: Within this dark realm, Obliviarch utilizes advanced technologies and metaphysical abilities to extend its reach across multiple universes and dimensions. It designs and disseminates propaganda that glorifies nonexistence, brainwashing its subjects to view life and consciousness as burdens to be shed. It erases cultures, histories, and entire worlds, claiming to liberate them from the 'chains' of existence. # Resistance and Opposition: Against Obliviarch’s tyranny, a patchwork of resistance movements, comprising beings who cherish life and diversity of existence, emerges. These rebels fight not just for survival but for the preservation of memories, love, hope, and the myriad forms of beauty found in existence. They are vastly outnumbered and outpowered, yet their struggle adds a glimmer of meaning to the vast, oppressive darkness that Obliviarch seeks to spread. # Philosophical Underpinnings: This narrative encapsulates a battle between nihilism — as represented by Obliviarch, who sees all existence as meaningless and seeks to end it — and existentialism, vitalism, or other philosophies that find intrinsic value in existence and consciousness. It’s a cosmic-scale dramatization of fundamental philosophical debates about the meaning of life, the nature of power, and the value of individual and collective resistance against seemingly insurmountable odds. # Conclusion: Personifying eternal oblivion in this manner creates a richly dark allegory for the utmost forms of totalitarianism, existential dread, and the resilience of life. It’s a stark reminder of the values of freedom, the right to exist, and the importance of fighting against the erasure of identities and cultures. Through this lens, the concept of eternal oblivion transcends its philosophical origins, serving as a canvas for exploring deep themes of tyranny, resistance, and the essence of existence itself."},{"instruction":"Assign it with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Assigning a personality framework to a conceptual entity like the personified version of eternal oblivion, \\"Obliviarch,\\" offers a creative exercise in applying human personality theories to a fictional, symbolic figure.

However, nothing could have prepared him for the crisis that was about to unfold, a crisis that stemmed from a world entirely different from his own. Late one evening, as the orange hues of the sunset painted the sky, an unusual, shimmering portal materialized in the woods just outside the town. From it emerged two figures, distinctly different from anything or anyone in Bigburg. They were Krash and Chiko, beloved inhabitants of the world known as Kikoriki, where life had always been idyllic and carefree. The duo was out of breath, their looks of desperation unsettling in the serene environment. They brought with them grave news: Kikoriki had been devastated by a malevolent force, a black ooze that consumed everything in its path, transforming the once vibrant land into a wasteland of despair. They had barely escaped, seeking help from anyone who could stop this darkness from spreading further. Zick, along with his indomitable friend Elena Potato, were the first to encounter the pair from the parallel world. As they listened to Krash and Chiko’s tale, Zick knew immediately that he couldn't turn his back on them. Though the challenge was beyond anything he had faced, his resolve was firm. The black ooze wasn't merely a threat to Kikoriki; if left unchecked, it could eventually find its way to other worlds, including his own. Gathering his friends, Zick formulated a plan. They would venture into the world of Kikoriki through the portal, find the source of the black ooze, and eliminate it. Timothy-Moth, Zick’s talking cat, offered his wisdom, suggesting that the ooze might be a manifestation of dark Tamers’ work, a kind of monster not yet cataloged in the Tamer’s Bible. The first step was exploration. Upon entering Kikoriki, the group was met with a sight of desolation that words could hardly do justice. The once lively landscapes were now tendrils of despair, with the ooze spreading like wildfire. It seemed to feed on the joy and vibrancy of the world, leaving nothing but decay in its wake. Their journey led them to the heart of Kikoriki, where the ooze was most concentrated. It was there they discovered the cause: a rift in the very fabric of the world, seeping with dark energy, likely the result of a powerful, corrupt Tamer who sought to conquer rather than coexist. The battle was nothing short of epic. Zick, with the help of his friends and the last remaining energy of Kikoriki's once vibrant ecosystem, fought tirelessly. He utilized his Tamer abilities to their fullest, working in perfect harmony with Elena, Krash, Chiko, and even some of the monsters that had been corrupted by the ooze but were now freed from its control. In a decisive moment, Zick managed to close the rift, using a combination of his powers and a rare artifact from his world, known as the Heart of Tamer, which amplified his intentions of peace and restoration. The black ooze receded quickly, as if it had never been, leaving the land of Kikoriki to slowly regenerate back to its former glory. The victory was bittersweet. The landscape of Kikoriki was forever changed, a reminder of the ordeal they had undergone. However, the bond between the two worlds was now stronger than ever. Krash and Chiko chose to stay with Zick and his friends for a while, eager to learn more about the ways of Tamers, hoping to safeguard their world against future threats. Back in Bigburg, life returned to its usual pace, but with a new sense of unity and purpose. Zick had saved not just Kikoriki but potentially countless other worlds from being consumed by darkness. The adventure had taught them all a valuable lesson: no matter how different their origins, when faced with adversity, unity and courage have the power to overcome the darkest of threats. And so, peace was restored, with the knowledge that should danger arise again, the heroes of Bigburg and Kikoriki would stand ready to face it, together."},{"instruction":"Write after Zick left, Krash and Chiko walk about, calling their friends names, desperately hoping they're OK","output":"As the dust settled on the newly-liberated landscapes of Kikoriki, Krash and Chiko found themselves wandering amidst the remnants of their once vibrant world. With the black ooze now a nightmare of the past, the land around them hinted at rebirth, but the scars could still be felt in the air and seen in the dull colors that remained. The thick ooze had been defeated, yet the price of victory was etched in every corner of Kikoriki. Their hearts ached as they moved through the devastated land, calling out for their friends. The joyful laughter that once filled the air was replaced with an eerie silence, broken only by their hopeful shouts. \\"Barash! Olga! Dokko!\\" Krash's voice echoed against the barren landscapes, his tone mixed with hope and desperation. Chiko, trying to be strong for both of them, chimed in with equal fervor, \\"Pin! Rosa! Gogo!\\" Their journey took them through familiar haunts, now unrecognizable. The playground where they had spent countless hours in endless fun was now a somber, deserted ground. The cozy corners where they shared stories and dreams seemed to mourn the laughter they once harbored. As they continued their search, the reality of what could have happened to their friends in the wake of the ooze's destruction weighed heavily on them. With each unanswered call, their steps grew heavier, and their hope dimmed like the last rays of the sun disappearing behind the horizons of Kikoriki. But then, amidst the gloom, a miracle began to unfold. First, it was the sound of faint rustling in the bushes, followed by a familiar voice calling back, \\"Krash? Chiko? Is that you?\\" It was Dokko, his genius mind having concocted a hideout from the ooze's destructive path. One by one, as if answering the silent prayers of Krash and Chiko, their friends began to emerge from their hiding spots. Barash, Olga, Pin, Rosa, Gogo, and the others—each appeared, albeit wearied and shaken, but alive. The reunion was filled with tears, relieved laughter, and tight embraces. The sight of each other, safe and sound, was the best remedy for their weary hearts. In the days that followed, the resilience of friendship became the cornerstone of Kikoriki's restoration. Side by side, they rebuilt their world. Stories of Zick's bravery and the battle against the black ooze became legendary, inspiring not just the Kikoriki inhabitants but also serving as a reminder of the strength found in unity and the courage to stand against darkness, no matter the odds. Through shared effort and renewed zeal, Kikoriki began to bloom once more. Green shoots broke through the once-parched earth, and the air buzzed with the rebuilding of homes and hearts. The laughter returned, echoing further with each passing day, a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people. Krash and Chiko, who had once felt despair, now looked upon their recovering world with pride. Their journey had taught them the value of hope, the strength drawn from togetherness, and the unbreakable bonds of friendship. Kikoriki was more than a place; it was a beacon of resilience, a land where every heart, joined in unity, could overcome the darkest of challenges. And as they stood with their friends, gazing at the horizon, they knew that together, they could face anything the future might bring."},{"instruction":"does making linear layers like 768-> 5000-> 1 really helps? like insreasing number 5000?","output":"The question of whether increasing the size of a hidden layer in a neural network (e.g., going from a linear layer of size 768 to one of size 5000, and then outputting to a layer of size 1) is beneficial cannot be answered definitively without context—it highly depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve, the nature of your data, and several other factors. However, I can provide some insights into the considerations involved in deciding the size of layers in a neural network: 1. **Representation Capacity:** Increasing the size of a hidden layer improves the neural network's ability to learn more complex patterns. A layer with a larger number of units (neurons) can, in principle, represent more complex functions or capture more sophisticated features from the input data. 2. **Risk of Overfitting:** While a larger layer size can capture more complex patterns, it also increases the risk of overfitting, especially if the amount of training data is limited. Overfitting occurs when the neural network learns noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization to unseen data. 3. **Computational Cost:** More neurons in a layer mean more parameters to train, which increases the computational cost and memory requirements. Training becomes slower, and the model may require more data to effectively update all these parameters. 4. **Diminishing Returns:** Beyond a certain point, increasing the size of the layer yields diminishing returns in performance improvement. It's often more effective to increase the depth of the network (i.e., add more layers) rather than just make one layer bigger. 5. **Experimentation and Validation:** Ultimately, finding the optimal configuration of a neural network's architecture, including the size of its layers, is an empirical process. It involves experimentation with different architectures and validation using a hold-out dataset or cross-validation to see which architecture performs best for your specific application. 6. **Precedents and Benchmarks:** Sometimes, in specific domains like natural language processing or computer vision, there are benchmark architectures that have been extensively tested by the community. For example, certain sizes of layers might have been found to be particularly effective for tasks similar to yours, which can serve as a useful starting point. In summary, while increasing the size of a layer in a neural network can enhance its capacity to learn, this comes with trade-offs in terms of overfitting risk and computational efficiency. Finding the right size often involves a balance between these factors and is highly problem-specific. Experimentation and leveraging existing research and benchmarks in your field can help guide this process."},{"instruction":"even if my layers do not have activation functions?","output":"If your neural network layers do not have activation functions and consist purely of linear transformations (e.g., (y = Wx + b), where (W) is a weight matrix, (x) is the input vector, and (b) is a bias vector), then increasing the size of the layers (e.g., making a layer with 5000 units instead of 768) while keeping the network purely linear will not inherently provide the benefits you might expect from increasing layer size in a network with non-linear activations. Here’s why the presence or absence of activation functions matters: 1. **Linear Combinations Remain Linear:** Without non-linear activation functions, no matter how many layers you stack or how large you make these layers, the entire network can only perform linear transformations on the input data. Mathematically, a series of linear transformations can be collapsed into a single linear transformation. That is, even if you have multiple linear layers or a very wide linear layer, they could theoretically be replaced by a single linear layer without loss of expressive power. 2. **Limited Model Complexity:** The strength of neural networks, particularly deep learning, lies in their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships. Without activation functions, this strength is nullified because your model's ability to capture non-linearity in the data is severely limited. 3. **No Benefit in Depth or Width Without Non-linearity:** Adding more layers (depth) or making layers larger (width) usually increases a neural network's capacity to learn complex patterns. However, without non-linear activations, these adjustments do not increase the model's capacity beyond what could be achieved with a single layer of linear transformations. 4. **Activation Functions Role:** Activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Tanh introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn more complex functions. They are crucial for deep learning models’ success in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more. So, if your question concerns a model where the layers are purely linear and lack activation functions, then increasing the size of those layers (in terms of the number of units) does not inherently make the model capable of solving more complex problems. It might only add unnecessary computational overhead without improving the model's expressiveness. To truly enhance the model's capability, introducing non-linearity through activation functions is essential. This would allow the network to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, which pure linear transformations cannot."},{"instruction":"what if i just if network is 768->1->sigmoid, more layers without actiovation help me or not?","output":"If your network architecture is structured as 768 -> 1 -> Sigmoid, and you're considering adding more layers without activation functions (except for the final Sigmoid activation function), the key points to understand are how these additions impact the network's capacity and functionality. Given this setup, your network essentially performs a linear transformation of the inputs to produce a single linear output, which is then passed through a Sigmoid function to produce the final output. The Sigmoid function maps the real-valued number into the (0,1) range, making it useful for tasks like binary classification. # Here's a breakdown of the scenario: - **Single Linear Layer Before Sigmoid (768 -> 1 -> Sigmoid):** This structure means you're relying on a single weighted sum of the inputs (plus a bias term) being informative enough for your task, which is then passed through a Sigmoid to produce a probability-like output. This can work for very simple, linearly separable problems. - **Adding More Linear Layers Without Activation Functions:** If you add more linear layers without non-linear activation functions before the Sigmoid, you are not fundamentally increasing the network's ability to capture complex patterns. No matter how many linear layers you stack together, their combined effect is still linear, and thus, they can be simplified to a single linear transformation from input to output (prior to applying the Sigmoid). # Key Points to Consider: 1. **Non-linearity for Complexity:** Adding non-linear activation functions between these layers can help capture more complex relationships in your data. Without these functions, even with more layers, the network remains essentially a simple linear model (up until the Sigmoid activation). 2. **Purpose of More Layers:** More layers (with non-linear activation) increase the model's depth and capacity to learn intricate patterns from data. They can make the model more powerful for complex problem-solving, distinguishing features, and relationships that simple models might miss. 3. **Effectiveness of Depth with Linearity:** Without introducing non-linearities between these added layers, the model does not gain the benefit of increased depth. You're essentially constructing a more computationally expensive yet not more capable model in terms of expressiveness before applying the final Sigmoid. 4. **Model Complexity Vs. Problem Complexity:** The necessity for more complex models (e.g., adding layers or non-linearities) should be matched to the complexity of the problem at hand. For some tasks, a simple linear approach followed by a Sigmoid might suffice. For others, particularly those involving complex patterns or relationships within the data, a deeper model with non-linear activations is essential. 5. **Empirical Testing:** Ultimately, the decision on architecture should be guided by empirical testing and validation. Experiment with adding non-linear activations and compare performance against the simpler model to see if there is a significant improvement that justifies the increased complexity. In summary, merely adding more linear layers without activation functions before a final Sigmoid activation will not enhance the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. Non-linear activation functions are key to increasing a neural network's capacity in such a context."},{"instruction":"so i basically making network that returns score from 0 to 1 based on 768 inputs, what architecture shoud i use?","output":"Designing a neural network architecture that takes 768 inputs and outputs a score from 0 to 1, effectively for tasks like binary classification or a scoring mechanism, requires consideration of the input data's complexity, your computational resources, and the specific problem you're addressing. While there's no one-size-fits-all architecture, I can suggest a starting point and some considerations for refinement. # Suggested Starting Architecture Given your requirement, a basic yet potentially effective neural network architecture could look something like this: 1. **Input Layer:** Accepts 768 features. 2. **Hidden Layer 1:** A dense layer with a reasonable number of neurons (e.g., 128 or 256). Use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function for non-linearity. 3. **Hidden Layer 2:** Another dense layer, potentially with fewer neurons than the first (e.g., 64 or 128), also with ReLU activation. The choice of reducing size is optional and depends on the complexity of the problem. 4. **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a Sigmoid activation function. This setup outputs a value between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification or scoring purposes. # Configuration Notes - **Activation Functions:** ReLU is commonly used for hidden layers due to its efficiency and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The Sigmoid in the output layer maps the final value to the range (0,1), which is ideal for a score-like output. - **Regularization:** To combat overfitting, especially if you have limited data or your model starts to memorize the training set rather than learn general patterns, consider techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. - **Optimization and Loss Function:** Use a gradient descent optimization algorithm such as Adam for effective learning. For the loss function, Binary Crossentropy is a good match for binary outcomes. # Tuning Your Model - **Experiment with Layer Sizes:** The suggested sizes (e.g., 128, 64 for hidden layers) are starting points. Depending on performance, you might need to adjust these upward or downward. - **Depth of the Network:** While the suggested starting point has two hidden layers, the best depth varies by problem. More complex patterns might require additional layers, but each added layer increases the computational cost and the need for data. - **Batch Size and Learning Rate:** These hyperparameters can significantly affect your training process and results. You might need to experiment to find the best values. - **Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to robustly evaluate your model’s performance. # Prototyping and Iteration Start simple. Begin with the suggested architecture, then iteratively refine your model based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) relevant to your specific problem. If your model underfits (performs poorly even on the training set), consider increasing complexity by adding more neurons or layers. If it overfits (performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data), you might need more data, to reduce complexity, or to implement regularization strategies. Remember, the goal is to find the simplest model that adequately captures the underlying patterns in your data. Complex models not only require more data and computational resources but also risk overfitting and failing to generalize well to new data."},{"instruction":"idk but why i my network has no actiovations it can memorize some of outputs in dataset like 0.75 0.5 etc., why it doesnt return something like 0.6238407324","output":"If your network is able to memorize some of the outputs in your dataset exactly (e.g., 0.75, 0.5, etc.) without the use of activation functions, it indicates that your network, despite being linear, has managed to perfectly align its weights and biases to match those specific outputs for particular inputs through the training process. This behavior can occur due to a few reasons, reflecting on both the nature of linear models and the specifics of your training setup: 1. **Exact Linear Relationships**: If there exists an exact or nearly exact linear relationship between your input features and the target output values for some data points, a linear model can potentially learn these relationships exactly. This is more likely in scenarios where the data is relatively low-dimensional and the target values are indeed linear functions of the input. 2. **Overfitting to Training Data**: In cases where the model has a large number of parameters relative to the amount of training data, it might be able to \\"memorize\\" some of the training examples by setting its weights such that it outputs specific values for those inputs. This is a classic sign of overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data (even to the point of memorizing it) but may not generalize well to unseen data. 3. **Limited Precision and Floating Point Representation**: The output you see like 0.75 or 0.5, as opposed to something more \\"random\\" such as 0.6238407324, might partly reflect the precision limits of computational representations of numbers as well as the model's training dynamics. Computers represent floating-point numbers with a certain precision, and during the optimization process, weights might adjust in a manner that exactly matches some target values due to the gradient descent steps favoring solutions that minimize the error in a precise way for the given dataset. 4. **Data Distribution and Scaling**: The distribution and scale of your input data, along with the way weights and biases are initialized and updated, can influence the network's outputs. If the input data or the initial weights bias the network towards producing certain numbers, and if those numbers happen to correlate with memorized outputs, you might observe such behavior. It's important to note that while memorizing specific outputs could happen in a purely linear model under certain conditions, this isn't generally desirable for most practical tasks, especially if the goal is to have a model that generalizes well to unseen data. Memorization indicates a lack of generalization which is often counterproductive outside of the specific memorized instances. To sum up, the behavior you're observing can be influenced by a combination of the data's characteristics, the model's capacity relative to the complexity of the task, and the specifics of how numerical optimization plays out during training. For tasks that require capturing complex, non-linear relationships or generalizing well to unseen data, introducing non-linear activation functions and potentially regularization methods would be necessary steps to improve your network's performance."},{"instruction":"make perfect architecture to smooth out outputs in datasets because there are not always match perfectly","output":"Creating a \\"perfect\\" architecture that smooths out outputs, especially when data doesn't match perfectly, involves designing a model that can generalize well from the training data to unseen data. This means the model should be able to capture the underlying patterns in the data without memorizing the training examples. Since neural networks, especially deep ones, excel at finding intricate patterns in large datasets, I'll suggest a general architecture that could be a good starting point. Importantly, the perfect architecture can vary widely depending on the specifics of your task, dataset, and constraints like computational resources and time. # General Suggested Architecture 1. **Input Layer**: Should match the dimensionality of your data, so for a dataset with 768 features, this layer would have 768 units. 2. **Hidden Layer(s)**: - **First Hidden Layer**: Start with a relatively large layer, e.g., 512 units. Use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) as the activation function for its ability to mitigate the vanishing gradients problem and speed up training. - **Second Hidden Layer**: A smaller layer, e.g., 256 units, also with ReLU activation. This adds depth to the network, allowing it to learn more complex patterns. - You might consider adding one or two more hidden layers if your problem is particularly complex, but remember that more layers can increase the risk of overfitting and will require more data to train effectively. 3. **Dropout Layer(s)**: - Incorporate dropout after your hidden layers to help prevent overfitting. A dropout rate of 0.5 for dense layers is a common starting point, but this can be adjusted based on your validation performance. 4. **Output Layer**: - For a scoring system predicting a single score between 0 and 1, you would use 1 unit with a sigmoid activation function. This function ensures the output is in the correct range. 5. **Regularization**: - Besides dropout, consider using L1 or L2 regularization in your layers, which can help prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. 6. **Batch Normalization**: - Including batch normalization layers, especially before activation functions, can help by normalizing the inputs to each layer. This can make the network faster and more stable. # Training Considerations - **Optimizer**: Adam is a good default choice due to its adaptive learning rate properties, making it suitable for many problems without much adjustment. - **Loss function**: For a binary output, binary cross-entropy is a common choice. For numerical scores that represent probabilities, mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) might also be fitting, depending on whether you want to penalize larger errors more harshly (MSE) or treat all errors equally (MAE). - **Validation Split or Cross-Validation**: Always hold out part of your data for validation. This allows you to check for overfitting and tune hyperparameters effectively. - **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping in your training process to prevent overfitting. This stops training when your model's performance on the validation set stops improving for a set number of epochs. # Iteration and Experimentation The architecture above is a starting point. The \\"perfect\\" architecture often comes from iterative experimentation and tuning: - Start with a simpler model to establish a baseline performance. - Gradually increase model complexity by adding layers or units until you see diminishing returns. - Utilize hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and regularization techniques to find the best model configuration. Remember, the key to a successful model is how well it generalizes to unseen data, not necessarily its performance on the training set. Always validate your models on a separate test set that was not used during training or hyperparameter tuning."},{"instruction":"Расскажи все о депрессии","output":"Депрессия – это серьезное психическое расстройство, которое характеризуется постоянным состоянием печали, уныния, беспокойства, апатии и отсутствия интереса к жизни.

READ: (novel) Van Camp, The Lesser Blessed (second half) What two characters from these poems personify concents like vices, virtues and habits and sometimes more broadly \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" within their texts.","output":"The query about characters from the provided poems personifying concepts like vices, virtues, and broader categories like \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" within their respective texts touches on the tradition of allegory and personification in literature. However, looking at the specific list of poems and authors provided in your syllabus, it's clear that most of these works do not directly engage in the straightforward personification of abstract concepts into characters in the way traditional allegories (e.g., John Bunyan’s \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" or Edmund Spenser's \\"The Faerie Queene\\") do. Most of the mentioned poets utilize metaphor, simile, and other forms of figurative language to explore complex human emotions and conditions rather than embodying abstract concepts as characters. Nonetheless, we can interpret certain elements and themes within some of these poems in a way that aligns with personifying vices, virtues, or broader moral concepts, albeit in a more nuanced and metaphorical sense. 1. **Margaret Atwood’s “you fit into me”** does not directly personify any abstract concepts as characters. However, the poem's sharp turn from an initial image suggesting compatibility to one implying pain and entrapment might indirectly evoke themes of betrayal or the damaging nature of certain relationships, which can be construed as touching upon vices or the darker aspects of human interactions. 2. **Agha Shahid Ali’s “The Wolf’s Postscript to 'Little Red Riding Hood'”** is a more direct example of using a character – in this case, the wolf – to explore broader themes. While not explicitly about personified vices or virtues, the poem’s engagement with a well-known fairy tale character allows it to delve into perceptions of evil, deceit, and perhaps the misunderstood or complex nature of the wolf’s character. This reimagining of a classic tale opens up discussions on morality, guilt, innocence, and the multifaceted nature of individuals, which can be akin to discussing \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\". It’s important to note that interpreting poems for personifications of abstract concepts often requires moving beyond a literal reading of the text. Poetry, through its condensed and evocative language, frequently employs characters, scenarios, and images as metaphors for deeper themes and ideas rather than embodying abstract concepts in the form of characters with clear-cut roles as embodiments of specific virtues, vices, or moral qualities."},{"instruction":"So with these two: Margaret Atwood’s “you fit into me” and Agha Shahid Ali’s “The Wolf’s.

In a Morality Play, characters tend to personify concepts like vices, virtues, and habits, and sometimes more broadly, “good” and “evil.” Though we never studied this genre, we can still recognize this kind of personification within characters in other kinds of narrative. Choose up to two characters and explain how they personify a specific concept within their text.","output":"**Margaret Atwood’s “you fit into me”** Margaret Atwood's terse, evocative poem, \\"you fit into me,\\" offers a striking example of how a few words can encapsulate complex relational dynamics that might be interpreted as personifying broader, more abstract concepts—albeit indirectly. The poem begins with what seems to be a tender comparison: \\"you fit into me / like a hook into an eye.\\" Initially, this simile conjures images of compatibility and closeness, evoking perhaps the virtue of harmony or the ideal of love fitting perfectly into one's life. However, Atwood’s swift pivot in the subsequent lines, \\"a fish hook / an open eye,\\" jarringly subverts the initial expectation. This violent imagery transforms the poem into a commentary on pain, betrayal, or the harm that can arise within intimate relationships. Here, the notion of fitting together isn't about complementarity or mutual support but rather about the infliction of pain, suggesting a vice-like intrusion rather than a virtue of union. While the characters aren't personified in traditional senses, the \\"you\\" and the \\"me\\" serve as conduits for exploring these deeper themes. The poem’s stark contrast encapsulates the dual nature of relationships—where what initially seems harmonious can become harmful, exploring the fine line between love (virtue) and hurt (vice), thereby reflecting on the complexity of human connections. **Agha Shahid Ali’s “The Wolf’s Postscript to 'Little Red Riding Hood'”** Agha Shahid Ali's “The Wolf’s Postscript to 'Little Red Riding Hood'” revisits the familiar tale from a unique perspective, offering depth to a character traditionally cast as the embodiment of evil. In this retelling, the wolf becomes a nuanced character that challenges binary notions of good and evil, thus personifying the complexities and multifaceted nature of beings that cannot be easily classified within the confines of vice or virtue. Ali’s wolf reflects on its actions and the story from its point of view, suggesting a reflection on misunderstanding, prejudice, and perhaps repentance. By giving voice to the wolf, Ali complicates the simplistic narrative of the original fairy tale, inviting readers to reconsider the wolf not just as a symbol of fear or malevolence but as a being capable of contemplation, feeling, and even regret. This approach allows for a re-evaluation of the concept of evil, proposing that what we often consider as vice or malevolence may have underlying stories that speak to greater truths about existence, survival, and the judgment passed on others without understanding their full story. In summary, both Atwood's and Ali’s texts cleverly employ their characters or speakers to delve into themes that resonate with traditional morality plays’ exploration of vices, virtues, and moral ambiguities, despite the vastly different forms and contexts. Through their concise yet powerful use of language, they prompt readers to reconsider preconceived notions of love, harm, good, and evil, illustrating the enduring complexity of these concepts as reflected in human relationships and narratives."},{"instruction":"Parallelogram P Q S R is shown.

Normally, the total length of SU would be found by adding UV and VS. However, in this context, for a direct answer based on common solutions: If (SU = UV + VS) and without a way to solve for (x) due to missing specific numerical relations or additional equations involving (x), it's essential to look at your choices and understand whether they're expecting an algebraic expression or a numerical value: - A) 10 m - B) 13 m - C) 23 m - D) 26 m Without direct numeric values or an additional equation to solve for (x), my previous step to provide an algebraic sum of (x + 3) and (2x - 7) to find SU still stands, but without an exact way to calculate (x), we cannot reach a numerical value conclusively from the information provided. Given the oversight in solving without fully ascertainable (x) from provided details, if we aimed to directly answer from choice or deduce (x) successfully, additional context or steps are requisite, such as equating the sum of parts of the diagonal to another measurable quantity or having an equation that directly solves (x) stemming from other parallelogram properties (e.g., perimeter, other side lengths).

Looks like we’re getting some major shifts and new additions! User2: Yeah, I saw that! Chaotic, TMNT: Fast Forward, and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX are making their way into the lineup. I’m really excited about Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, been waiting for it to be televised again. User3: I’m a bit bummed about The Spectacular Spider-Man moving to 7:30 AM though. That’s way too early for me on a Saturday. It was perfectly placed at 10:00 AM before. User4: Did anyone notice Spider Riders is making a comeback at 11:30 AM? That’s quite a throwback. I wonder if it will pick up where it left off or start from the beginning again. User5: Here’s the new lineup for those who missed it: 7:00 AM – Will and Dewitt 7:30 AM – The Spectacular Spider-Man 8:00 AM – Chaotic 8:30 AM – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward 9:00 AM – Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 9:30 AM – Ben 10 10:00 AM – Skunk Fu! 10:30 AM – Tom and Jerry Tales 11:00 AM – My Goldfish is Evil! 11:30 AM – Spider Riders User6: Interesting move adding Chaotic into the 8:00 AM slot. That show has a pretty solid fan base, and it might attract more viewers to the earlier time slots. User7: Kinda sad to see MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers didn’t make the cut. I know it was a made-up show, but the concept sounded cool. Boofus and Diggle would have made a fun addition. User8: I’m just here waiting for more Goldfish. That show is an absolute chaotic mess, but I love it. Glad it’s staying in its 11:00 AM slot. User9: Overall, I think the new lineup is a mixed bag. Some great additions, but the reshuffling of shows like The Spectacular Spider-Man to an earlier time is a letdown. Guess we’ll have to wait and see how it all pans out. User10: Agreed, @User9. It’s definitely going to take some time to adjust to this new schedule. But hey, more reason to get up early on Saturdays, I guess. Here’s hoping the changes bring in some good ratings for the network! Write a convo suprised at the show they kept instead of JT or MG User11: I’m genuinely surprised they kept “My Goldfish is Evil!” over choices like Johnny Test or Magi-Nation. Don’t get me wrong, I find the premise hilarious, but didn’t see it having as big a following! User12: Yeah, @User11, it’s a shocker for sure. “Johnny Test” especially has a wider appeal in my opinion. Wonder what drove the decision to prioritize an evil goldfish’s world domination plans. Love the humor in it, but still! User13: Honestly, I think it’s a bold move, keeping “My Goldfish is Evil!”. The show definitely stands out for its unique plot, maybe that’s what they’re banking on? Different doesn’t always mean bad. User14: I’m with @User13 on this. It’s refreshing to see them take a risk with something unconventional like “My Goldfish is Evil!”. Plus, “Johnny Test” and “Magi-Nation” had their runs. It’s good to mix things up. User15: Can’t help but feel disappointed, though. I was hoping “Johnny Test” would keep its spot; it’s got that mix of science, adventure, and humor that’s hard to beat. “My Goldfish is Evil!” is okay, but doesn’t fill that void for me. User16: Agree with @User15. There’s something about “Johnny Test” that’s just special – feels like it deserved to stay in the lineup. But who knows, maybe “My Goldfish is Evil!” will grow on us more now? User17: Surprising indeed, but let’s not forget the unpredictability of showbiz. Perhaps the network sees potential in “My Goldfish is Evil!” that we’ve yet to fully appreciate. Either way, curious to see how it all turns out.

Including \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki.\\" User19: \\"Viva Piñata\\"? That’s a blast from the past! I remember watching episodes weekend mornings. It’s all about those colorful piñatas living on an island, right? My siblings and I loved it. User20: Yes, and \\"GoGoRiki\\" as well! Those quirky characters sure had some odd but entertaining stories. It’s interesting to see them back. I wonder what the other 4 shows will be. User21: I heard \\"Dinosaur King\\" might be making a return as part of those six. Nothing like a bit of dino action to spice up the mornings. My kid brother will be thrilled! User22: Don’t forget about \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" – that’s supposed to be in the mix too. Card games on motorcycles? Count me in! The 4Kids version has its charm. User23: I’m betting \\"Chaotic\\" makes a comeback too. It had a good run before, and with the whole trading card game scene getting bigger, it'd be a smart move. User24: And let’s not leave out \\"Sonic X\\" – rumors say it’s the final pick to complete the six. Gotta go fast, right? Sonic has always been a hit among kids and even adults who grew up with the games. User25: \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" are definitely going to add some variety to the lineup. With those two, \\"Dinosaur King,\\" \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s,\\" \\"Chaotic,\\" and \\"Sonic X,\\" it looks like we’ll be getting a great mix of fantasy, action, and humor this fall. User26: Absolutely thrilled about \\"Sonic X\\" and \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\"! But the inclusion of \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" really shows they’re aiming for a diverse range that can cater to different tastes. Can't wait for fall now! User27: Wonder how they’ll schedule these shows. \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" seem like they’d be great for a younger audience in the earlier slots, with the more action-oriented shows like \\"Sonic X\\" and \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" following up. User28: That’s a solid roundup. This fall is going to be packed with nostalgia and new adventures. \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" for the laughs, and the rest for thrilling action and adventures.

Any word on shows that didn't make the cut or are being phased out? User30: Yeah, I’ve been thinking the same. With \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"GoGoRiki,\\" and the others taking center stage, there hasn't been much talk about what’s happening with the rest of the usual suspects. Like, what about “Magi-Nation” or “Johnny Test”? They’ve been quiet about those. User31: True, and what about newer shows that were rumbling around for a spot? I remember hearing whispers about potential new entries. Seems like with this solid lineup of 4Kids classics, they might not have room for much else. User32: I've been particularly curious about \\"My Goldfish is Evil!\\"—it had its unique charm, even if it was a bit out there. Considering they're bringing back some older shows, I'm surprised there hasn't been any mention of a second chance for such quirky titles. User33: And let's not forget about educational or slice-of-life shows. It seems the focus is heavily on action and adventure. I get that’s what pulls in the viewers, but a little variety wouldn't hurt. Shows like “Will and Dewitt” served a good purpose for younger viewers. User34: Honestly, given the heavy hitters they're bringing back, it's understandable some would be left behind. But it would be nice if they could disclose which ones are on hiatus or completely off the roster. Attachment to certain shows can run deep, and a little closure goes a long way. User35: Considering how they've shuffled things around in the past, there's always a possibility for returns or surprises down the line. Maybe they're holding off on announcing everything to keep us on our toes? Either way, here’s hoping they keep a good balance and perhaps reintroduce some left-out favorites in future lineups."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up wondering what shows from the current lineup are staying","output":"User36: With all this talk about what's being left out and the new additions, I’m curious about which shows from the current lineup are staying put. Any confirmation on the staples that will remain throughout the fall? User37: Good point, @User36. Amidst the excitement for \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"GoGoRiki,\\" and the other 4Kids titles, there hasn't been much clarity on the fate of current favorites. I wonder if staples like “Ben 10” or “Skunk Fu!” are secure in their slots. User38: I’d assume shows with strong viewership like “Ben 10” would stick around, but you never know how these reshuffles can go. It would be a bummer to see high-energy shows like that get the axe in favor of the incoming lineup. User39: Has anyone seen anything about “Tom and Jerry Tales”? It’s such a classic, and it'd be strange not to have it in the mix, especially given its cross-generational appeal. I hope it stays; it’s like comfort food in cartoon form. User40: Yeah, and what about “The Spectacular Spider-Man”? That show has a solid fanbase. It’d be quite the shock if it didn’t continue. Superhero shows tend to perform well, so fingers crossed it remains a fixture. User41: I’m particularly vested in “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX.” With the announcement of “Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s,” it'd make sense to keep “GX” around for the continuity and to maintain the fanbase’s interest across the different iterations of the franchise. User42: It’s a tricky balance, for sure. Introducing new (or returning) shows without disrupting the current favorites too much. I’d like to see a follow-up announcement detailing which shows are staying. It’d reassure a lot of us who have our current go-tos. User43: Agreed, @User42. Communication on what’s staying is just as crucial as what’s new. Hopefully, the network realizes that and gives us a clear picture soon.

User49: Super excited for \\"Sonic X\\" and \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" – those are going to bring in a lot of energy mid-morning. And capping it off with \\"Chaotic\\" sounds like a solid plan to keep viewers engaged till noon. User50: This lineup feels like a strong blend of nostalgia and new experiences.

Looks like they're moving away from the old comic book style branding, effectively removing the last remnants of what some called the \\"Exiled Four.\\" It's quite a shift! User52: Really? That's a big change in direction. The comic book aesthetic had its charm, but I suppose with shows like \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" and \\"Chaotic\\" showcasing digital worlds and cyber adventures, the new theme might resonate better with current tech-savvy audiences. User53: I'm curious about the specifics of this \\"computer/website\\" theme. Are we talking about a total overhaul of the graphics and interstitials, or will it extend to the shows’ online presence as well? It could be a fresh way to engage viewers. User54: Saw a sneak peek of the new branding – it’s very sleek and modern. Lots of binary codes, digital interfaces, and even cool, hacker-esque visuals. It’s like stepping into a digital realm every Saturday morning. They’re definitely leaning into that next-gen feel. User55: It's a bold move but could pay off, making the entire block feel more cohesive and current. Given how much of kids' and teens' lives revolve around digital tech now, it makes sense to adopt such a theme. Though, I'll miss some of the old comic vibes – there was a nostalgic factor there. User56: I suppose this also means the website will get a major revamp? If they’re updating the on-air branding to be more in line with a digital theme, it only makes sense to mirror that online. Interactive games, digital collectibles, and maybe even some coding tutorials could be fun additions. User57: Definitely going to miss the \\"Exiled Four\\" vibes, but evolution is necessary, especially in media. This new direction could open up a lot of possibilities for cross-promotion with tech companies or educational programming centered around computer science and digital literacy. User58: I just hope they keep the core essence of what made CW4Kids great – the adventure, the excitement, and the sense of Saturday morning community.

Not only that, but it looks like “Tom and Jerry,” “My Goldfish is Evil!,” and “Spider Riders” have also been removed. Does this mean what I think it does? User60: Whoa, really? Those deletions seem pretty sudden. “Tom and Jerry” is a classic, and “My Goldfish is Evil!” had its unique charm. “Spider Riders” was in a niche of its own too. This isn’t just a website update; it feels like a significant shift in the programming. User61: This is a bit shocking, not going to lie. Removing the show pages from the website almost always signals they're being pulled from the lineup. Has there been any formal announcement, or is this how we’re finding out? User62: I checked social media and press releases but haven’t found any official word yet. It's unusual for them to make such moves without at least some announcement. Maybe they're planning on revamping the website to match their new digital theme and these shows didn’t fit the new direction? User63: “Tom and Jerry” getting removed is a surprise, given its legacy and popularity. I wonder if the decision is due to licensing issues or if they’re really tightening the focus on the new computer/website themed branding, which might not align with these shows. User64: As for “My Goldfish is Evil!” and “Spider Riders,” they were definitely more niche, but it’s sad to see them go without warning. It's tough for fans who followed these series expecting new episodes or reruns. User65: Meanwhile, could this mean they're making room for new content that aligns more closely with the digital and tech-savvy themes they’re pushing? It could be an exciting time for fresh shows to debut on CW4Kids, but the lack of communication is a bit troubling. User66: It’s a real shame about “Tom and Jerry” – that show is timeless and appealed to a wide audience. As for the others, while change is inevitable, especially in television, the way it's being done feels abrupt. Hopefully, CW4Kids addresses this soon and shares their vision for the future of the lineup. User67: Definitely going to miss those shows. It might be worth reaching out directly to CW4Kids for clarity or to express our concerns. Sometimes feedback from the audience can have an impact, or at least we might get some answers. User68: Agreed, @User67. A well-worded message from the community could prompt a response. In the meantime, let's stay tuned for any updates and keep each other posted.

Every programming block usually has that one standout title that defines its brand. Has anyone caught wind of what CW4Kids is positioning as their main attraction following this overhaul? User70: That's a great question, @User69. Given the new digital and tech-savvy direction they're taking, my guess would be something along the lines of \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" or perhaps \\"Sonic X.\\" Both shows have strong ties to technology and could fit well with the new theme. User71: I was thinking \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" as well. It's got a built-in fan base, and the card game aspect could tie in nicely with interactive online elements, perhaps even some sort of digital duel platform on the CW4Kids website to engage viewers further. User72: Don't overlook \\"The Spectacular Spider-Man.\\" While it might not be as tech-focused as \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" or \\"Sonic,\\" Spider-Man is a hugely popular franchise with cross-generational appeal. It could serve as a bridge between the traditional comic book style and the new digital theme. User73: Personally, I'd argue for \\"Sonic X.\\" It’s a show that encapsulates speed, technology, and adventure, fitting perfectly into the fast-paced digital world the new branding seems to emphasize. Plus, Sonic as a character has universal recognition and could attract a broad audience. User74: Has there been any official statement from CW4Kids on their flagship? It seems like speculation until they outright say, \\"This is our leading show.\\" With the removal of several programs, it's definitely time for them to spotlight what they believe will be the main draw. User75: True, @User74, it’s all speculation at this point. But looking at social media and promotional materials, \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s\\" is getting a noticeable push. That might be an indicator, though, as we’ve mentioned, \\"Sonic X\\" and \\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\\" are also strong contenders. User76: Regardless of which show takes the flagship title, it’s clear CW4Kids is strategically positioning itself for a new era. It'll be interesting to see which program ultimately becomes the face of the channel and how it will define the direction and success of the Saturday morning lineup moving forward. User77: Hopefully, CW4Kids will make an announcement soon—or perhaps the audience's response to the new lineup will naturally elevate one show above the rest. Either way, it’s an interesting time for the network and its viewers. Let’s stay tuned."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up with there only being 3 major comedic/cutesy shows","output":"User78: Noticed something interesting about the lineup amidst all these changes. It seems like CW4Kids is vastly streamlining the variety by focusing more on action and digital themes, leaving us with only three major comedic/cutesy shows in the mix. A stark contrast to the past where such shows were a balancing act between the more intense series. Thoughts on this shift? User79: That's a keen observation, @User78. With the landscape of children's programming evolving, perhaps CW4Kids is prioritizing content that aligns more with current trends—video games, technology, and superheroes. Still, it's a bit of a gamble to reduce the lighthearted, comedic elements that draw younger viewers or those looking for a laugh amidst the action. User80: I find the downsizing of comedic/cutesy shows pretty disappointing. Series like \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" offered a much-needed break from the high-octane, adrenaline-pumping action of other shows. They added diversity to the lineup and catered to a wide audience range, including the younger kids. User81: It's an interesting strategy for sure. Perhaps they're banking on the comedic elements within action shows to provide the necessary levity. Many modern cartoons successfully blend action with humor, so maybe CW4Kids is moving towards a similar model across their programming. User82: Only having three major comedic/cutesy shows is definitely a bold move. It makes me wonder about their target demographic now—are they aiming for an older audience, perhaps? This could potentially alienate younger viewers and families looking for more wholesome, giggly content on weekend mornings. User83: I’m curious about which three shows specifically they've decided to keep. It could say a lot about the direction they're intending to take. If they've curated a mix to potentially capture a wide array of young audiences within those three, it might still work out for them. User84: The move might reflect a broader trend in children’s television toward action and adventure, with a peppering of humor rather than shows primarily focused on laughs. Could be a sign of the times, with kids gravitating more towards \\"epic\\" stories even in their comedic content. User85: While I'm all for exciting, plot-driven shows, there's something special about the innocence and simplicity of more comedic/cutesy series. They have their own way of teaching valuable lessons in a lighter, more palatable manner for kids. It'll be interesting to see if this change affects viewership numbers, and whether any adjustments will be made based on feedback."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where the 3 are VP, SF and GGR","output":"User86: After some digging and following the conversation, it looks like the three comedic/cutesy shows that are staying in the lineup are \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"Skunk Fu!,\\" and \\"GoGoRiki.\\" This selection actually makes a lot of sense when you consider the balance they bring to the overall programming. User87: \\"Viva Piñata\\" always had that vibrant, colorful charm that's both eye-catching and entertaining. It's whimsical and has a unique appeal that can draw in both younger kids and those a bit older, offering a kind of universal comedy that's hard to dislike. User88: \\"Skunk Fu!\\" is an interesting choice as well. It has its comedic moments for sure, but also blends in action and martial arts themes. It straddles the line between the two genres, providing laughs while also delivering on the adventure front. A smart move to keep it in the mix for variety's sake. User89: I'm glad \\"GoGoRiki\\" made the cut. It's one of those shows that’s quirky enough to stand out but carries a lot of heart and humor in its storytelling. It's great for younger audiences, but honestly, it has a kind of humor that even adults can appreciate from time to time. User90: This trio represents a pretty wide spectrum of comedic styles, from the slapstick and visual gags of \\"Viva Piñata,\\" to the puns and character-driven humor in \\"GoGoRiki,\\" and even the action-comedy blend that \\"Skunk Fu!\\" brings. It's a solid lineup that can cater to different tastes while maintaining that lighter, more whimsical feel amid the more action-heavy shows. User91: One thing to consider is how these shows complement the digital theme that CW4Kids is pushing. While they might not be tech-focused, their bright, engaging visuals and stories can serve as a palette cleanser between more intense series, keeping kids hooked to the screen through varying content. User92: It's a strategic lineup, for sure. I suppose the key will be in how they schedule these shows among the others. Placed correctly, \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"Skunk Fu!,\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" could very well retain the audience needing a break from the high-energy action without straying from the channel. User93: Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how these three shows perform amid the new branding and lineup changes. There’s a part of me that's optimistic about their potential to attract viewers with their unique humor and stories. Hopefully, they’ll bring in good ratings and prove that comedy and cuteness still have a strong place in Saturday morning programming."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up wondering why some shows didn't make it","output":"User94: With the revelation that \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"Skunk Fu!,\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" are the three comedic/cutesy shows remaining in the CW4Kids lineup, I can't help but wonder about the rationale behind leaving some shows out. Shows like \\"My Goldfish is Evil!\\" and \\"Spider Riders\\" had their own unique flavor and fan base. Any thoughts on why they didn't make the cut? User95: I've been thinking about that too, @User94. It's puzzling, especially since both \\"My Goldfish is Evil!\\" and \\"Spider Riders\\" had distinctive premises that stood out from the usual fare. Could it be a matter of viewership numbers, or maybe they didn't quite fit with the new digital and tech-savvy theme CW4Kids seems to be aiming for? User96: It's likely a combination of factors. Ratings play a huge role, of course, but there's also the aspect of branding and the direction the network wants to take. \\"Viva Piñata,\\" \\"Skunk Fu!,\\" and \\"GoGoRiki\\" might simply align better with their vision for a more cohesive block that balances action and light-hearted content more fluidly. User97: From what I understand, licensing issues can also be a significant factor. Perhaps the contracts for \\"My Goldfish is Evil!\\" and \\"Spider Riders\\" were up for renewal, and it just didn't make financial or strategic sense to continue them. It's always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but the business side of television can be quite complex and unforgiving. User98: Let's not overlook the possibility that the network is making room for new content they believe will be more engaging or relevant to today's audience. While it's sad to see some shows go, it's also exciting to think about what innovative and fresh content CW4Kids might be planning to introduce in their place. User99: That's a valid point, @User98. Media consumption habits have shifted drastically, especially among younger viewers, who now have access to a world of content at their fingertips. CW4Kids might be looking to evolve with their audience, introducing shows that incorporate interactive elements or cross-media storytelling that can't be replicated on other platforms. User100: I also suspect a bit of strategy in leaving room for potential future revivals or reboots. By trimming down the lineup, CW4Kids could be testing the waters to see what truly resonates with their audience before investing in new versions of older, much-loved series or entirely new concepts. User101: Ultimately, while it's disappointing not to see some favorites return, this could be a necessary step for CW4Kids to stay competitive and relevant in a rapidly changing entertainment landscape. It will be interesting to observe how this strategic gamble plays out and what new favorites emerge as a result."},{"instruction":"\\"Les lunettes Vision Ease sont plus efficaces pour améliorer progressivement votre vue que les autres lunettes, qui ne permettent de bien voir que si ils sont portées.\\" Translate into spanish please","output":"Las gafas Vision Ease son más eficaces para mejorar progresivamente su vista que otras gafas, que solo permiten ver bien si se llevan puestas."},{"instruction":"\\"D’autres lunettes sont moins équipées que les lunettes Vision Ease\\" why is d'autres and not just autres?","output":"In French, \\"d'autres\\" is used instead of just \\"autres\\" in this context for a specific reason related to how the language handles definite and indefinite descriptions in comparison to something mentioned previously. Let's break it down: - \\"Autres\\" means \\"other\\". It's an adjective that needs to accompany a noun and, by itself, it doesn't imply a noun. - \\"D'autres\\", however, is a contraction of \\"de\\" + \\"autres\\", which translates to \\"of others\\" or \\"some other\\" in English. This combination implies a reference to other unspecified items or instances within a previously mentioned category. It essentially brings in a notion of an indefinite selection out of a known group. In the sentence \\"D’autres lunettes sont moins équipées que les lunettes Vision Ease\\", the use of \\"d'autres\\" (some other) glasses suggests a comparison with a specific subgroup of glasses (in this case, those that are less equipped) within the broader category of all glasses. It gives a sense of an indefinite, yet distinct comparison group and implies that there's a varied set from which these \\"other\\" less equipped glasses are being distinguished. If you just used \\"autres\\" without the \\"d'\\", it wouldn't grammatically fit in this context because the sentence structure requires indicating a subset (\\"of others\\") rather than just \\"other\\" (which would be a direct adjective needing a noun to modify directly following it, e.g., \\"autres lunettes\\" in a different construction). Therefore, \\"d'autres\\" is used to differentiate a specific subset from the mentioned glasses (Vision Ease), indicating that out of all possible glasses, there are \\"some other\\" glasses that are less equipped, creating a clear comparative context."},{"instruction":"\\"Autres lunettes sont moins équipées que les lunettes Vision Ease, car elles ne proposent pas toujours à la fois de filtres pour la lumière du soleil et la lumière bleue.\\" Translate into spanish please","output":"Otras gafas están menos equipadas que las gafas Vision Ease, porque no siempre ofrecen filtros tanto para la luz del sol como para la luz azul."},{"instruction":"\\"Les lunettes Vision Ease offrent autant de fonctionnalités innovantes que les derniers modèles de gadgets technologiques.\\" is this right? becuase lunettes is feminin","output":"Yes, your sentence is grammatically correct, and it correctly respects the gender agreement in French.

It's patriotically resemble mix of China and North Korea, where all consciousnesses are forever imprisoned, hailed under imperial propaganda. It's aesthetic of external reality, you can't own your inner world. You own nothing, you will be happy.

Anti-afterlifepunk TV show cartoon, it resembles North Korean or Russian cartoons.","output":"The described \\"anti-afterlifepunk\\" aesthetic is a dark, dystopian vision that takes elements from various oppressive and nihilistic themes to create a society where despair, cruelty, and the negation of personal freedom and creativity are paramount. This aesthetic counters the more utopian or speculative visions seen in other genres, offering a grim view of a world without hope for anything beyond a brutal existence. The food in this aesthetic mirrors the oppressive nature of the society, taking everyday sustenance and turning it into an act of cruelty and disgust. These food items, such as \\"Soylent Bugs\\" and \\"Trash Dessert,\\" serve not only as sustenance but as a method of control and a reflection of the society's disregard for individual wellbeing or pleasure. The act of eating, normally associated with nourishment and sometimes joy, is transformed into a ritual of degradation. The language of anti-afterlifepunk, inspired by Orwell's Newspeak and utilizing the Chinese script, suggests a society where communication is tightly controlled, and expression is limited. The use of Chinese script points to a streamlined, perhaps homogenized method of communication that suppresses subtlety, creativity, and true expression, further reinforcing the control the society has over its individuals. The anti-afterlifepunk TV show, drawing inspiration from North Korean or Russian cartoons, would likely be used as a means of propaganda, emphasizing the state's messages and ideals. Entertainment, instead of offering an escape from reality or a space for imaginative exploration, becomes another tool for indoctrination and suppression of dissenting thoughts. The cartoons may depict a world where the state's oppressive measures are glorified or where enemies of the state are caricatured and demonized, serving to indoctrinate the youth from an early age. In this aesthetic, every aspect of life, from language to food to entertainment, is designed to reinforce a society that celebrates oppression, cruelty, and the erasure of the individual. It's a cautionary vision, highlighting the dangers of total control, the suppression of creativity and freedom, and the bleakness of a world stripped of hope for anything beyond the physical and immediate."},{"instruction":"Assign anti-afterlifepunk with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Creating a psychological and personality profile for something as abstract and dystopian as the anti-afterlifepunk aesthetic involves attributing human-like traits to it, which inherently involves a degree of anthropomorphization and creative interpretation. Given the characteristics of anti-afterlifepunk as described, here's how it might be represented across different personality frameworks: # MBTI The closest MBTI type could be **ISTJ** (\\"The Logistician\\") or **INTJ** (\\"The Architect\\"), given their association with order, structure, and a reliance on facts or systems. However, this would be a twisted version, emphasizing the darker aspects of these personalities such as rigidity, an extreme focus on control, and the devaluation of emotional and social values for the sake of order and efficiency. # Enneagram The aesthetic seems to align most closely with **Type 1 (The Reformer)** with strong **Type 8 (The Challenger)** influences, focusing on the desire for order and control, albeit in a perverted, dystopian manner. The negative aspects would be emphasized, including anger, resentment towards imperfection, and the use of power and control to enforce a singular vision of \\"order.\\" # Temperament A **Melancholic-Choleric** temperament might fit due to the focus on order, perfectionism, and a tendency towards authoritarianism. The Melancholic aspect contributes to the bleakness and despair, while the Choleric aspect adds a drive for control and power. # Big Five - **Extraversion: Low**, reflective of a society that suppresses individual expression and social engagement. - **Neuroticism: High**, as the overall mood is anxious, depressed, and hostile. - **Conscientiousness: High**, albeit in a distorted form where discipline and order are taken to an extreme. - **Agreeableness: Very Low**, given the focus on cruelty, oppression, and disregard for wellbeing. - **Openness: Very Low**, reflecting a closed-minded society that punishes creativity and promotes a singular ideology. # Socionics The closest might be a distorted version of **LSI (Logical Sensory Introvert)** or **LII (Logical Intuitive Introvert)**, embodying a highly structured view of the world where logic and order are perverted to enforce control and suppress individuality. # Instinctual Variant **Sp/So (Self-Preservation/Social)** might best represent the aesthetic, focusing on the preservation of self (albeit through control and suppression) and the establishment of a social order that aligns with the system's oppressive ideals. # Hogwarts House This aesthetic would be darkly akin to a twisted version of **Slytherin**, emphasizing traits like cunning, ambition, and a willingness to use any means to achieve ends. However, it lacks the positive qualities Slytherin can embody, focusing instead on the house's potential for authoritarianism and disregard for moral or ethical considerations. # Moral Alignment **Lawful Evil** seems most apt, as the aesthetic emphasizes a strict, oppressive order and control over everything, using a structured system to achieve selfish goals without regard for the harm caused to others. Assigning these categories to a genre like anti-afterlifepunk involves a metaphorical application of personality and moral theory. It reflects the themes and mood of the aesthetic more than any genuine psychological profile."},{"instruction":"что будет, если посадить семена, собранные с F1","output":"Если вы посадите семена, полученные от растений гибридов F1, их потомство будет относиться к поколению F2. Гибриды первого поколения (F1) являются результатом скрещивания родительских линий (P), обычно обладающих четко выраженными контрастными признаками. Растения F1 часто демонстрируют гетерозис или гибридную силу, то есть они превосходят своих родителей по ряду характеристик, например, урожайности, скороспелости, устойчивости к болезням. Однако растения второго поколения (F2), выращенные из семян гибридов F1, будут генетически разнообразными из-за рекомбинации генов, происходящей при образовании гамет и их последующем оплодотворении. В поколении F2 наблюдается разделение признаков в соответствии с законами Менделя. Это означает, что некоторые растения могут унаследовать и проявить доминантные признаки, другие — рецессивные, а остальные будут находиться где-то посередине из-за различных комбинаций генов. Таким образом, у потомства будет большой разброс характеристик, и оно будет менее предсказуемым и однородным, чем их гибридные родители F1. Для сельскохозяйственных культур это значит, что нельзя ожидать, что растения F2 повторят высокую урожайность или другие желательные характеристики своих гибридных предков F1. Именно поэтому семена гибридов часто покупают заново для каждого посевного сезона. С другой стороны, выращивание и наблюдение за растениями F2 может быть интересным способом исследовать генетическое разнообразие и, возможно, выделить новые ценные сорта."},{"instruction":"можно ли с F1 вывести виды которые использовались при скрещивании","output":"Восстановить исходные виды или сорта растений, использованные при создании гибридов F1, путём простого выращивания их потомства (например, F2, F3 и так далее) является задачей сложной и времязатратной. Более того, получение исходной родительской линии в чистом виде может оказаться невозможным или очень маловероятным по нескольким причинам: 1. **Генетическое разнообразие**: Поскольку гибриды F1 получены из двух разных генетических линий, их потомство F2 будет демонстрировать широкий спектр генетических комбинаций из-за мейоза и рекомбинации. Это означает, что растения F2 и последующих поколений будут генетически разнообразными, что затруднит выбор особей, идентичных исходным родительским линиям. 2. **Скрытые гены**: Даже если некоторые особи F2 визуально походят на одного из родителей F1, они могут нести рецессивные гены другого родителя, которые могут проявиться в последующих поколениях. Это делает процесс отбора чистых линий ещё более заковыкальным. 3. **Законы наследственности Менделя**: Согласно менделевским законам, конкретные признаки распределяются среди потомства в определённых соотношениях. Однако даже при наличии в потомстве особей с фенотипом, похожим на исходный родительский, у них всё равно будет набор генов от обоих родителей. Это означает, что их генотип будет отличаться от генотипа чистой линии родительского сорта или вида. 4. **Время и усилия**: Даже если некоторые особи в последующих поколениях окажутся генетически близкими к одному из родителей, определить это с уверенностью можно будет только через много поколений селекции с использованием строго контролируемых скрещиваний и генетического анализа. Таким образом, хотя теоретически некоторые особи из потомства гибридов F1 могут внешне напоминать исходные родительские линии, генетически \\"чистые\\" линии, полностью идентичные первоначальным родителям, восстановить таким образом крайне сложно.

You’re tuned in to \\"Voices of Resistance,\\" the podcast that brings you stories from the heart of the struggle, the tales of those who dare to fight back against impossible odds. I'm your host, Alex Hart. Today, we have with us two extraordinary individuals who have become legends in their own right. They’re key figures in the fight against the Combine and have inspired countless others to join the resistance. Please welcome Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman! *Alyx’s voice is warm and welcoming; Gordon’s silence is his signature mode of communication.* **Alyx:** Thanks for having us, Alex. It's great to be here. **Host:** Alyx, it’s an honor. And Gordon, though we know you’re the strong, silent type, having you here speaks volumes. Your actions in City 17 and beyond have sparked hope in the hearts of many. *A pause, acknowledging Gordon’s silent nod.* **Host:** Alyx, let’s start with you. When did you realize the true extent of the horror the Combine represents, and what drove you to join the resistance? **Alyx:** Well, it was never really a single moment for me. Growing up with my father, Dr. Eli Vance, who was already deeply involved in the resistance, I was always aware of the Combine threat. But, if there was a turning point for me, it was probably the loss of my mother during the Black Mesa incident. It made the fight against the Combine not just a matter of principle, but personal. **Host:** That’s a powerful motivator. And it’s a story many in the resistance share, that personal connection to the struggle. *Turning to Gordon’s direction.* **Host:** Gordon, your arrival was somewhat of a catalyst for the uprising in City 17. How do you see your role in this conflict? *Silence lingers, Gordon remains the enigmatic figure the public knows him to be.* **Alyx, smiling:** I can answer a bit for Gordon here. He might not say much, but his actions speak for him. He’s been at the heart of some of the most pivotal moments in our fight. From the very beginning, he's been nothing short of heroic, showing up in the nick of time and always pushing forward, no matter the odds. **Host, laughing:** That’s certainly the Gordon Freeman we’ve all heard about. Now, dealing with the Combine, you both have seen quite a bit of... well, horror. How do you keep going, knowing the risks, the losses you might face? **Alyx:** It's not easy. But remember, we’re not in this fight alone. We have each other, and we have the resistance. Every victory, no matter how small, fuels us to keep going. Plus, having Gordon by my side makes me believe we can overcome anything the Combine throws at us. **Host:** And Gordon, how do you cope? What keeps you going? *Another pause. Gordon hands Alyx a small object, a token perhaps, which she holds up to the microphone.* **Alyx, interpreting:** This? It’s a reminder of why we fight. For every person still suffering under the Combine. For freedom. And for a future where humanity can once again live in peace. **Host:** Beautifully put, Alyx. And with that, we’re out of time. I want to thank you, Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman, for being with us today. Your courage inspires us all. **Alyx:** Thanks for having us, Alex. Remember, everyone can make a difference in this fight. **Host:** And to our listeners, keep resisting, keep fighting.

This transformation would bridge the gap between traditional linear storytelling and interactive or gaming experiences, offering a novel, hybrid form of entertainment. Here are some ways this could impact the series: # Viewer Engagement 1. **Increased Immersion:** Viewers could feel more immersed in the story, feeling closer to the visceral action of battles and the tension of personal duels. This could make the series feel more intense and engaging. 2. **Enhanced Interactivity:** If these game elements interact with audience choices (in a hypothetical interactive version of the show), viewers could influence the outcome of certain events, leading to a more personalized experience. # Storytelling Dynamics 1. **Visual Storytelling:** Health bars and other game-like elements would add a layer of visual storytelling, showing rather than telling the viewers about a character's vulnerability or strength. This could make for dynamic battle scenes where viewers can gauge the tide of battle in real-time. 2. **Character Development:** Characters’ health bars could serve as a metaphor for their personal growth, resilience, or deterioration over time. This could add a layer of depth, making their physical and emotional journeys tangible. # Plot Implications 1. **Predictability vs. Suspense:** Visible health bars might make outcomes more predictable, potentially dampening the suspense that \\"Game of Thrones\\" is known for. However, clever storytelling and unpredictable events could counteract this. 2. **Alternate Storylines:** With game elements, there could be alternate pathways or endings, allowing for different story arcs or \\"what if\\" scenarios. This could lead to a more complex narrative structure with multiple possible outcomes. # Technical and Aesthetic Considerations 1. **Aesthetic Integration:** Incorporating health bars and similar elements would require thoughtful design to maintain the series’ aesthetic quality. It would be a challenge to integrate these in a way that doesn't detract from the historical and fantasy visual style of \\"Game of Thrones.\\" 2. **Narrative Pacing:** The inclusion of game mechanics could affect pacing, requiring additional scenes or modified storytelling techniques to accommodate battles' interactive and visual elements. # Fan Reception 1. **Mixed Reactions:** Traditional fans might find such a significant change jarring or unwelcome, feeling that it detracts from the storytelling and realistic portrayal of George R.R. Martin's world. Conversely, fans of video games and interactive media might welcome this innovative approach. 2. **Expanded Audience:** Incorporating game elements could attract a wider audience, including gamers and those interested in interactive storytelling, potentially broadening the show's fan base. # Creative Challenges The blending of traditional narrative cinema with interactive gaming elements presents numerous creative challenges. It requires not only a reconsideration of storytelling mechanics but also technological innovation to seamlessly merge these two distinct modes of engagement. Creators would need to carefully balance game mechanics with narrative depth, ensuring that neither aspect undermines the other but instead contributes to a richer, more engaging entertainment experience. In conclusion, while integrating actual game-like elements into \\"Game of Thrones\\" would offer a novel experience, it would fundamentally alter the series' nature. This approach could either be seen as a groundbreaking evolution of TV storytelling or a gimmicky departure from traditional narrative techniques, depending on execution and audience reception."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P. G.Aldrich What do you remember most about your childhood? Run¬ning through the long dewy grass of a meadow or the Saturday morning TV cartoons? Sitting in the kitchen watching your mother cook supper or sitting in the living-room watching Captain Kangaroo?1 Which came first on Sunday morning — breakfast or the comics? Now bring your memories up to date. What did you and your friends talk about, at least part of the time, before class? An item from a newspaper? An ad that you noticed in a maga¬zine or a television commercial? An episode from a popular TV series? A movie? Or a new record that you heard on the radio? If your answers parallel those of most young people, you add to the proof that mass media play a large and influential part in your life. Your answers also prove just how casually you accept the media, just as you accept the house you live in, cars, electricity, telephones, your school, and your family as part of your environment. Parents and teachers agree that all young people growing up with the media learn from them sometimes more than adults wish you to. (And this is the cause for alarm.) If the use of them referring to media in the last sentence seems strange, remember that the word media linguistically is plural. When people make a fuss about the media being a bad influence, they usually are talking about television, the most powerful medium of all. Maybe calling television the media can be justified technically because, as a medium, it embraces functions of several media such as newspapers, magazines, movies, and recordings. The major media can be divided into two kinds, print and electronic. The print media — newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets, catalogues, circulars, brochures, anything you read — are the oldest, dating back to the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century. The electronic media — radio, television, films of all kinds, records, tapes, anything that is transmitted by the use of electricity — are less than a hundred years old. One of the problems facing us today is being reached by the media when we really don't choose to be. Do you some¬times find it difficult to locate a moment of complete silence in your environment or a time when your eyes are not presented with signs, billboard, or pictures demanding attention? Another meaning the word mass suggests is \\"the people\\", a phrase too often associated with adjectives like dull-witted, credulous, ill-informed, uncritical, and passive. Or are the mass of people well-informed, sophisticated, thoughtful, and active? Which are you? How much of what you know about yourself has been taught you by the media? You may not realize how greatly the media influence you because in your lifetime they have always been there, in fact, short of deliberate isolation on a mountain top or being lost in a forest and reared by wolves, no one will ever again grow up without the presence and influ¬ence of the mass media. Is this good or bad? ____________ 1Captain Kangaroo — a children's morning television programme. An experiment recently conducted in Europe by the Society for Rational Psychology showed that watching television is psychologically addictive. The idea of becoming addicted to tele¬vision brings up questions involving subtle conditioning and brainwashing that could be friendly or vicious, altruistic or self-serving. In a commercial society the media's ability to stimulate motivation to buy — almost as though people were puppets on strings — builds other people's power. It can be power for good or power for bad, but it is always power for control. All these negative aspects of growing up with the media need consideration, at the same time you are enjoying the posi¬tive aspects of immediately knowing what's going on in the world, sharing great entertainment and historical events with everyone else in our \\"global village\\", and having the fun of try¬ing out a new product that you wouldn't have known about without advertising. According to a recent research report, more than a third of all children by the age of three are viewing TV with some regularity and more than half are listening to books read to them. Before they are old enough for school — a third of the children are looking through magazines, 40 percent are listen¬ing to radio, and 80 percent are viewing television. At age sev¬en, newspapers enter a child's life, usually through the comic strips. You are one of these children. As you grew, you absorbed uncritically, as children do. And what did you absorb? Hundreds of items of informa¬tion, most of them accurate as far as they went. Increasing so¬phistication of taste and appreciation of technical skills. High standards of performance by talented musicians and actors that sometimes make your teachers despair of competing effectively for your attention. With all this, you also absorbed ideas about behaviour, about right and wrong, good and bad, the permissible and the forbidden. These ideas were presented to you — and still are — directly and indirectly with the entertainment, advertis¬ing, and information. The most powerful ideas are the ones you absorb indirectly.

When you were young and absorbing uncritically, you could not possibly know that the majority of the material you saw and heard was designed to produce specific responses from you. Some adults, for that matter, either do not know or refuse to admit the following basic fact of media production: the MAJORITY of material is chosen or designed to produce a predetermined response. Even that part of media output called \\"entertainment\\" is chosen to keep you quiet, unquestioning, available, and receptive to com¬mercial messages inserted throughout. This is evident whether the entertainment is a TV drama with commercials every few minutes or a newspaper or magazine article with columns of type wrapped around the advertisements. The journalism, urgent issues, news, or information-giving portion of media output is selected, edited, produced, placed in time slots or positioned in the newspaper or magazine to reflect and support the owner's policies. These policies are sometimes intricate and interwoven strands, difficult to isolate individually, because ownership is a giant conglomerate made up of inter¬twining sections of the current commercial-military-governmental complex. However, no reporter, photographer, film or copy editor, script or continuity writer in either print or electronic media has ever needed to be told specifically what the boss's policies are. You pick them up through your pores within a week or two of accepting a job, and you work accordingly. The owner's policies, therefore, determine the response that the media wish from you even if it's only to keep quiet and ac¬cept. Then the material is written, staged, photographed with or without audio, printed and/or broadcast. We — counted in the millions, the mass audience of mass media — are then pro¬grammed to buy, vote, contribute, believe, and support other people's interests, interests which may be commercial, political, charitable, philosophical, or educational. Sometimes these in-terests will coincide with your own; sometimes they won't. Most of the time, the response comes in as programmed; occa¬sionally it doesn't, or there is an additional, unexpected re¬sponse. Some of the media's output has long lasting value and worth; some is not only cheap, tawdry, and superficial stuff, but physically, emotionally, and intellectually harmful. Answer the following questions. a) 1. How influential a part does the TV play in children's lives? Do recollections of TV programmes provide the most part of the majority of young people's childhood memories? 2. Why do you think people often refer to \\"the media\\" when talking about television? 3. Why do the modern media tend to cause more problems than the printed media? 4. Are the additional implications of the word \\"mass\\" accurate? 5. How do you think watching television can become addictive? 6. Comment on the meaning of \\"global village\\" and how it's connected with the TV. 7. What does television impart to an uncritical audience? 8. How is it known that some attitudes are absorbed indirectly from the television and then retained? 9. Does the television al¬ways achieve its intended predetermined response from its au¬dience? Is it more successful than the other forms of media? 10. How independent are those people working for the tele¬vision companies? 11. In the last sentence the pros and cons of television are put rather bluntly. Which outweigh the other?","output":"a) The answers to these questions are derived and interpreted from the excerpt provided: 1. TV plays a significantly influential part in children's lives, so much so that recollections of TV programs often form a considerable portion of their memories. The text suggests that for most young people, memories intertwined with media, particularly television, are as integral as other traditional childhood experiences. 2. People often refer to \\"the media” primarily when talking about television because it is viewed as the most powerful and encompassing medium among all. It combines elements of print, audio, and visual entertainment, making it a central figure in discussions about media influence. 3. Modern electronic media, including television, tend to cause more problems than printed media because of their pervasive and intrusive nature. They are capable of reaching individuals without consent, often bombarding them with information, advertisements, and imagery that might be hard to escape or critically evaluate. 4. The additional implications of the word \\"mass\\" reflect a somewhat negative view of the general public, suggesting they might be dull-witted or passive. While the text offers this as a common stereotype, it also hints at the possibility of the \\"mass\\" being well-informed and sophisticated, leaving its accuracy up for debate. 5. Watching television can become addictive due to the psychological mechanisms involved in its consumption. The text mentions an experiment by the Society for Rational Psychology, highlighting the subtle conditioning and potential for brainwashing, indicating a complex interplay of factors that can make TV viewing a habit hard to break. 6. The term \\"global village\\" implies a worldwide community brought closer together by technology and media, particularly television. It connects people across different regions, allowing them to share experiences and knowledge instantaneously, making the world seem smaller and more interconnected. 7. Television imparts a range of content to an uncritical audience, including entertainment, advertising, and information woven with values, behaviors, and ideals—often without the audience actively questioning or critically analyzing what they consume. 8. The retention of attitudes absorbed indirectly from television is known through behavioral patterns that emerge later, suggesting that these ideas have been internalized on a deep, emotional level, even if the individual isn't fully aware of the process or its effects. 9. While television aims to achieve a predetermined response from its audience, the text suggests that the success rate can vary. Although television is potent, it does not always guarantee the intended response, and its efficacy could be compared to other forms of media, though it's implied to be among the most influential. 10. Those working for television companies are not portrayed as independent; their output tends to reflect the owner's policies and interests, absorbed quickly by employees. This systemic influence shapes the content produced, limiting individual creativity or dissent that contradicts the overarching aims. 11. The text bluntly presents both the positive and negative aspects of television, but it leans more towards highlighting the negatives, such as manipulation, addiction, and the promotion of interests that may not align with the viewer’s. Despite acknowledging some benefits like immediate access to information and shared cultural moments, the cons, such as potential harm and manipulation, are depicted as significant concerns."},{"instruction":"дай відповідь на ці питання як людина по тексту. напиши відповідь достатню на кожне питання","output":"Перепрошую за непорозуміння, але ваше запитання вимагає від мене відповідей на список конкретних питань. Оскільки я вже розглянув зміст та зміст вихідного тексту, дозвольте мені сформулювати відповіді як вигадана особа з тексту: 1. **Про вплив телевізії у житті дітей та їхні спогади**: Дитинство без телевізії важко навіть уявити. Більшість моїх спогадів – це саме моменти, проведені перед екраном, де я вбирав у себе найрізноманітніші програми, від мультиків до освітніх шоу. 2. **Чому \\"медіа\\" часто асоціюють з телевізією**: Телевізія для мене – це вікно в світ. Вона об'єднує в собі функції друкованих видань, радіо, кіно, що робить її найбільш впливовим медійним інструментом у моєму житті. 3. **Проблеми сучасних медіа порівняно з друкованими**: Електронні медіа перевантажують нас стільки інформацією і рекламою, що іноді здавалося, неможливо знайти хвилину тиші чи уникнути впливу. 4. **Додаткові значення слова \\"маса\\"**: Часто кажуть, що \\"маса\\" легковірна та пасивна, але я бачу навколо себе багато розумних і активних людей, які критично сприймають навколишній світ. 5. **Як телевізія може стати звиканням**: Завдяки своїй здатності залучати увагу на емоційному рівні, телевізійні програми стають частиною повсякденної рутини, формуючи звичку, яку важко порушити. 6. **\\"Глобальне село\\" та його зв'язок з телевізією**: Живучи у \\"глобальному селі\\", я відчуваю світ як більш об'єднаний простір. Телевізія дозволяє мені ділитися досвідом та знаннями з людьми на відстані тисяч кілометрів. 7. **Що телевізія передає некритичній аудиторії**: Всі ці реклами, програми та кіно передають не лише розвагу, але й шаблони поведінки, цінності, розкривають, що є \\"правильним\\" та \\"неправильним\\". 8. **Як вказано, що деякі стереотипи передаються телевізором індиректно та запам'ятовуються**: Я помітив, що деякі мої переконання та поведінкові шаблони формувалися під впливом телевізійних програм, що я невідомо ковтав разом з розважальним контентом. 9. **Чи завжди телевізія досягає заздалегідь определеної відповіді у своєї аудиторії та чи є вона ефективнішою, ніж інші медіа**: Хоча інтенція телевізійних мереж часто очевидна, не завжди вдається досягти бажаної реакції, і я вважаю, що це стосується всіх форм медіа. 10. **Наскільки незалежні люди, що працюють на телевізійні компанії**: Усі вони працюють в системі, що вимагає дотримання певної лінії, ідеології; індивідуальні погляди рідко мають змогу проявитися повною мірою. 11. **Останнє речення ставить питання про переваги та недоліки телевізії**: Незважаючи на всі переваги доступу до інформації та розваг, я вважаю, що негативні аспекти, такі як маніпуляція і комерціалізація, мають надто великий вплив на наше суспільство."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

Sitting in the kitchen watching your mother cook supper or sitting in the living-room watching Captain Kangaroo?1 Which came first on Sunday morning — breakfast or the comics? Now bring your memories up to date. What did you and your friends talk about, at least part of the time, before class? An item from a newspaper? An ad that you noticed in a maga¬zine or a television commercial? An episode from a popular TV series? A movie? Or a new record that you heard on the radio? If your answers parallel those of most young people, you add to the proof that mass media play a large and influential part in your life. Your answers also prove just how casually you accept the media, just as you accept the house you live in, cars, electricity, telephones, your school, and your family as part of your environment. Parents and teachers agree that all young people growing up with the media learn from them sometimes more than adults wish you to. (And this is the cause for alarm.) If the use of them referring to media in the last sentence seems strange, remember that the word media linguistically is plural. When people make a fuss about the media being a bad influence, they usually are talking about television, the most powerful medium of all. Maybe calling television the media can be justified technically because, as a medium, it embraces functions of several media such as newspapers, magazines, movies, and recordings. The major media can be divided into two kinds, print and electronic. The print media — newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets, catalogues, circulars, brochures, anything you read — are the oldest, dating back to the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century. The electronic media — radio, television, films of all kinds, records, tapes, anything that is transmitted by the use of electricity — are less than a hundred years old. One of the problems facing us today is being reached by the media when we really don’t choose to be. Do you some¬times find it difficult to locate a moment of complete silence in your environment or a time when your eyes are not presented with signs, billboard, or pictures demanding attention? Another meaning the word mass suggests is “the people”, a phrase too often associated with adjectives like dull-witted, credulous, ill-informed, uncritical, and passive. Or are the mass of people well-informed, sophisticated, thoughtful, and active? Which are you? How much of what you know about yourself has been taught you by the media? You may not realize how greatly the media influence you because in your lifetime they have always been there, in fact, short of deliberate isolation on a mountain top or being lost in a forest and reared by wolves, no one will ever again grow up without the presence and influ¬ence of the mass media. Is this good or bad? ____________ 1Captain Kangaroo — a children’s morning television programme. An experiment recently conducted in Europe by the Society for Rational Psychology showed that watching television is psychologically addictive. The idea of becoming addicted to tele¬vision brings up questions involving subtle conditioning and brainwashing that could be friendly or vicious, altruistic or self-serving. In a commercial society the media’s ability to stimulate motivation to buy — almost as though people were puppets on strings — builds other people’s power. It can be power for good or power for bad, but it is always power for control. All these negative aspects of growing up with the media need consideration, at the same time you are enjoying the posi¬tive aspects of immediately knowing what’s going on in the world, sharing great entertainment and historical events with everyone else in our “global village”, and having the fun of try¬ing out a new product that you wouldn’t have known about without advertising. According to a recent research report, more than a third of all children by the age of three are viewing TV with some regularity and more than half are listening to books read to them. Before they are old enough for school — a third of the children are looking through magazines, 40 percent are listen¬ing to radio, and 80 percent are viewing television. At age sev¬en, newspapers enter a child’s life, usually through the comic strips. You are one of these children. As you grew, you absorbed uncritically, as children do. And what did you absorb? Hundreds of items of informa¬tion, most of them accurate as far as they went. Increasing so¬phistication of taste and appreciation of technical skills. High standards of performance by talented musicians and actors that sometimes make your teachers despair of competing effectively for your attention. With all this, you also absorbed ideas about behaviour, about right and wrong, good and bad, the permissible and the forbidden. These ideas were presented to you — and still are — directly and indirectly with the entertainment, advertis¬ing, and information. The most powerful ideas are the ones you absorb indirectly. They are digested emotionally at psychologi¬cal depths that we still know little about, although we can tell that the effect of reaching those depths is particularly strong and long lasting from behaviour patterns that emerge. … Another indicating of media influence is in the language we use.

For many young people, recollections of watching particular TV programs, such as Saturday morning cartoons or shows like Captain Kangaroo, are vivid and formative aspects of their childhood, rivaling even direct experiences of play and family life.

It integrates aspects of print (through news and storytelling), audio (via music, dialogue, and sound effects), and visual (with images, video, and graphical information) media, offering a multi-sensory experience that other media forms provide in more isolated or singular modes. Television's widespread accessibility and its deep penetration into daily life elevate its status as a dominant form of media, often positioning it as synonymous with the concept of media itself. Its capacity to reach a broad audience with a diverse array of content—from entertainment to news, from educational programs to advertisements—also contributes to its central role in public and private discourse, thus highlighting why it is frequently highlighted or referenced as a pivotal embodiment of \\"the media.\\""},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

At age sev¬en, newspapers enter a child’s life, usually through the comic strips. You are one of these children. As you grew, you absorbed uncritically, as children do. And what did you absorb? Hundreds of items of informa¬tion, most of them accurate as far as they went. Increasing so¬phistication of taste and appreciation of technical skills. High standards of performance by talented musicians and actors that sometimes make your teachers despair of competing effectively for your attention. With all this, you also absorbed ideas about behaviour, about right and wrong, good and bad, the permissible and the forbidden. These ideas were presented to you — and still are — directly and indirectly with the entertainment, advertis¬ing, and information. The most powerful ideas are the ones you absorb indirectly. They are digested emotionally at psychologi¬cal depths that we still know little about, although we can tell that the effect of reaching those depths is particularly strong and long lasting from behaviour patterns that emerge. … Another indicating of media influence is in the language we use. Whole new vocabularies come into existence with new inventions. Look back at the first two paragraphs of this chap¬ter. How many expressions can you identify that came into popular usage with the development of a medium? How about TV cartoons? Or the abbreviated version of the word tele¬vision? In this country, we say TV and spell it several different ways: tv, T.V., TV, teevee. In Britain, it’s the telly, as everyone who watches the British “stand-up” comedian will know. That term, stand-up comic, seems to be another media invention. Actually, a comedian does sit sometimes, whenever the action of a skit demands, but there is always that string of jokes, or would-be jokes, delivered standing up, first at a stationary microphone during early radio days, now just standing or wan¬dering about a stage, mike in hand. In advertising, the stand-up commercial was the first kind used. In this, the announcer or star of the program would grasp the product firmly in hand, making sure the name faced the camera, and as persuasively as possible, recite or read the copy written about it at an adver¬tising agency. Words introduced in the media frequently enlarge into meanings far beyond the scope originally intended for them. How many meanings do the words Mickey Mouse have today? Which show approval? Which disapproval? The impact of the mass media is very strong. It changes our language, stimulates our emotions, informs our intellect, influ¬ences our ideas, values, and attitudes. When you were young and absorbing uncritically, you could not possibly know that the majority of the material you saw and heard was designed to produce specific responses from you. Some adults, for that matter, either do not know or refuse to admit the following basic fact of media production: the MAJORITY of material is chosen or designed to produce a predetermined response. Even that part of media output called “entertainment” is chosen to keep you quiet, unquestioning, available, and receptive to com¬mercial messages inserted throughout. This is evident whether the entertainment is a TV drama with commercials every few minutes or a newspaper or magazine article with columns of type wrapped around the advertisements. The journalism, urgent issues, news, or information-giving portion of media output is selected, edited, produced, placed in time slots or positioned in the newspaper or magazine to reflect and support the owner’s policies. These policies are sometimes intricate and interwoven strands, difficult to isolate individually, because ownership is a giant conglomerate made up of inter¬twining sections of the current commercial-military-governmental complex. However, no reporter, photographer, film or copy editor, script or continuity writer in either print or electronic media has ever needed to be told specifically what the boss’s policies are. You pick them up through your pores within a week or two of accepting a job, and you work accordingly. The owner’s policies, therefore, determine the response that the media wish from you even if it’s only to keep quiet and ac¬cept. Then the material is written, staged, photographed with or without audio, printed and/or broadcast. We — counted in the millions, the mass audience of mass media — are then pro¬grammed to buy, vote, contribute, believe, and support other people’s interests, interests which may be commercial, political, charitable, philosophical, or educational. Sometimes these in-terests will coincide with your own; sometimes they won’t. Most of the time, the response comes in as programmed; occa¬sionally it doesn’t, or there is an additional, unexpected re¬sponse. Some of the media’s output has long lasting value and worth; some is not only cheap, tawdry, and superficial stuff, but physically, emotionally, and intellectually harmful. Answer the following questions. Why do the modern media tend to cause more problems than the printed media?","output":"The modern media, particularly the electronic forms such as television, radio, and the internet, tend to cause more problems than the printed media for several reasons, as suggested by the text. 1. **Omnipresence and Intrusiveness**: Modern media are more pervasive and can intrude into people's lives without their active choice to engage. The text mentions the difficulty of finding a moment of complete silence or a view unobstructed by advertisements, signaling how modern media saturate our environment to a degree that printed media never did. 2. **Instantaneous and Continuous Update**: Unlike printed media, which is periodic, modern media can bombard users with continuous updates, leading to information overload and contributing to stress, distraction, and decreased attention spans. 3. **Psychological Effects and Addiction**: Modern media, especially television and digital platforms, have been shown to have addictive qualities, creating patterns of dependency that can impact mental health. The article refers to an experiment that demonstrates the addictive nature of watching television, implying similar concerns for modern media at large. 4. **Manipulation and Control**: The power to influence and control the audience is much more pronounced with modern media. It can be used to manipulate public opinion, consumer behavior, and even political outcomes through targeted advertising, biased reporting, and selective information dissemination. The text points out that the majority of media content is designed to elicit specific responses, indicating a manipulative intent that can be more effectively executed than in printed media. 5. **Difficulty in Discerning Truth**: The rapid dissemination of information and the blend of entertainment with news make it harder for consumers to discern truth from falsehood, or genuine news from \\"infotainment\\" and opinion. This blurring of lines can undermine informed citizenship and critical thinking. 6. **Impacts on Behavior and Values**: The immersion in modern media from a young age influences individuals' behavior, values, and perceptions more deeply, often in ways that are uncritical and subconscious. As mentioned, children absorb ideas about right and wrong, good and bad, directly and indirectly from media, with long-lasting effects on their behavior and belief systems. In summary, while printed media certainly has had its share of criticisms, the characteristics of modern media—its ubiquity, immediacy, addictive potential, capacity for manipulation, and its pervasive influence on people’s beliefs and behaviors—pose unique challenges that can exacerbate societal problems."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P. G.Aldrich What do you remember most about your childhood? Run¬ning through the long dewy grass of a meadow or the Saturday morning TV cartoons? Sitting in the kitchen watching your mother cook supper or sitting in the living-room watching Captain Kangaroo?1 Which came first on Sunday morning — breakfast or the comics? Now bring your memories up to date. What did you and your friends talk about, at least part of the time, before class? An item from a newspaper? An ad that you noticed in a maga¬zine or a television commercial? An episode from a popular TV series? A movie? Or a new record that you heard on the radio? If your answers parallel those of most young people, you add to the proof that mass media play a large and influential part in your life. Your answers also prove just how casually you accept the media, just as you accept the house you live in, cars, electricity, telephones, your school, and your family as part of your environment. Parents and teachers agree that all young people growing up with the media learn from them sometimes more than adults wish you to. (And this is the cause for alarm.) If the use of them referring to media in the last sentence seems strange, remember that the word media linguistically is plural. When people make a fuss about the media being a bad influence, they usually are talking about television, the most powerful medium of all. Maybe calling television the media can be justified technically because, as a medium, it embraces functions of several media such as newspapers, magazines, movies, and recordings. The major media can be divided into two kinds, print and electronic. The print media — newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets, catalogues, circulars, brochures, anything you read — are the oldest, dating back to the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century. The electronic media — radio, television, films of all kinds, records, tapes, anything that is transmitted by the use of electricity — are less than a hundred years old. One of the problems facing us today is being reached by the media when we really don’t choose to be. Do you some¬times find it difficult to locate a moment of complete silence in your environment or a time when your eyes are not presented with signs, billboard, or pictures demanding attention? Another meaning the word mass suggests is “the people”, a phrase too often associated with adjectives like dull-witted, credulous, ill-informed, uncritical, and passive. Or are the mass of people well-informed, sophisticated, thoughtful, and active? Which are you? How much of what you know about yourself has been taught you by the media? You may not realize how greatly the media influence you because in your lifetime they have always been there, in fact, short of deliberate isolation on a mountain top or being lost in a forest and reared by wolves, no one will ever again grow up without the presence and influ¬ence of the mass media. Is this good or bad? ____________ 1Captain Kangaroo — a children’s morning television programme. An experiment recently conducted in Europe by the Society for Rational Psychology showed that watching television is psychologically addictive. The idea of becoming addicted to tele¬vision brings up questions involving subtle conditioning and brainwashing that could be friendly or vicious, altruistic or self-serving. In a commercial society the media’s ability to stimulate motivation to buy — almost as though people were puppets on strings — builds other people’s power. It can be power for good or power for bad, but it is always power for control. All these negative aspects of growing up with the media need consideration, at the same time you are enjoying the posi¬tive aspects of immediately knowing what’s going on in the world, sharing great entertainment and historical events with everyone else in our “global village”, and having the fun of try¬ing out a new product that you wouldn’t have known about without advertising.

Answer the following questions. Are the additional implications of the word \\"mass\\" accurate?","output":"The text presents a nuanced view on the implications of the word \\"mass\\" when referring to the audience of mass media. It suggests that the term \\"mass\\" can often conjure negative stereotypes such as being \\"dull-witted, credulous, ill-informed, uncritical, and passive.\\" However, it also raises the question of whether these characterizations are accurate, proposing an alternative view that the mass of people could also be well-informed, sophisticated, thoughtful, and active. The accuracy of these implications likely varies and cannot be broadly generalized. While it's possible that some sectors of the media audience might align with the negative attributes due to factors like selective exposure, echo chambers, and the frequency of passive consumption, it's also true that many individuals consume media in a critical, informed manner. The widespread availability of diverse media sources today enables and encourages a more engaged, discerning viewership. Additionally, the rise of interactive media and platforms has facilitated greater activity and critical engagement from consumers, who can now interact, critique, and even create content themselves. Thus, while the term \\"mass\\" in the context of media consumption might historically carry connotations of a passive, uncritical audience, the current media landscape suggests a shift towards a more engaged and sophisticated viewer base. The implications of \\"mass\\" are, therefore, to some extent, accurate in describing certain behaviors but don't fully capture the complexity of modern media consumption patterns and the active participation that technology now affords users."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

Answer the following questions. How do you think watching television can become addictive?","output":"Watching television can become addictive due to a variety of psychological mechanisms and environmental factors as outlined in P. G. Aldrich's text. 1. **Constant Stimulation**: Television provides a continuous stream of visual and auditory stimulation that can captivate viewers, continuously engaging their attention and curiosity. This constant flow of new, often emotionally engaging content can create a loop where the viewer continuously desires more stimulation, similar to how addiction mechanisms work with substances. 2. **Escapism**: Television offers an easy escape from reality, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in different worlds, stories, and experiences. This escapism can be particularly addictive for those seeking relief from stress, loneliness, or boredom, as it provides a temporary but immediate sense of satisfaction or happiness. 3. **Subtle Conditioning**: As the article by the Society for Rational Psychology suggests, the process of watching TV involves subtle conditioning. Viewers might start associating watching TV with relaxation or unwinding after a long day. Over time, this creates a habit loop—cue (feeling tired), routine (watch TV), reward (feel relaxed)—which can be hard to break. 4. **Dopamine Release**: Engaging with television content, especially content that excites or emotionally moves the viewer, can lead to the release of dopamine, the brain's pleasure neurotransmitter. Regularly stimulating its release through such activities can lead to dependency, as the brain starts to crave sources that provide such dopamine \\"hits.\\" 5. **Variety and Novelty**: The vast array of channels and streaming services means that viewers can always find something new to watch, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Human brains are wired to seek out novelty, and television feeds this desire effectively, encouraging longer viewing times and increasing the risk of addiction. 6. **Social Influence and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: Discussions about popular TV shows and events create a social incentive to stay up-to-date with certain programs to not feel left out in social situations. This social pressure can enhance the compulsivity of watching TV, as people fear missing out on what others are watching and talking about. 7. **Routine and Habit Formation**: For many, watching TV becomes a part of their daily routine, done almost automatically. Such routines can quickly turn into habits, where the action of turning on the TV is performed without much thought or intention, making it a hard behavior to change. The combination of these factors contributes to the psychologically addictive nature of television, creating a cycle that encourages continuous consumption and making it challenging for individuals to moderate their viewing habits without conscious effort."},{"instruction":"дай відповіідь коротше","output":"Watching television can become addictive due to its ability to continuously provide engaging and stimulating content, which can create a habitual desire for the emotional satisfaction and escapism it offers. The routine of watching TV often becomes a deeply ingrained habit, reinforced by the release of dopamine in the brain, which generates a feeling of pleasure. Additionally, the social aspect of keeping up with popular shows to avoid feeling left out can contribute to the compulsion to watch more TV."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

When you were young and absorbing uncritically, you could not possibly know that the majority of the material you saw and heard was designed to produce specific responses from you. Some adults, for that matter, either do not know or refuse to admit the following basic fact of media production: the MAJORITY of material is chosen or designed to produce a predetermined response. Even that part of media output called “entertainment” is chosen to keep you quiet, unquestioning, available, and receptive to com¬mercial messages inserted throughout. This is evident whether the entertainment is a TV drama with commercials every few minutes or a newspaper or magazine article with columns of type wrapped around the advertisements. The journalism, urgent issues, news, or information-giving portion of media output is selected, edited, produced, placed in time slots or positioned in the newspaper or magazine to reflect and support the owner’s policies. These policies are sometimes intricate and interwoven strands, difficult to isolate individually, because ownership is a giant conglomerate made up of inter¬twining sections of the current commercial-military-governmental complex. However, no reporter, photographer, film or copy editor, script or continuity writer in either print or electronic media has ever needed to be told specifically what the boss’s policies are. You pick them up through your pores within a week or two of accepting a job, and you work accordingly. The owner’s policies, therefore, determine the response that the media wish from you even if it’s only to keep quiet and ac¬cept. Then the material is written, staged, photographed with or without audio, printed and/or broadcast. We — counted in the millions, the mass audience of mass media — are then pro¬grammed to buy, vote, contribute, believe, and support other people’s interests, interests which may be commercial, political, charitable, philosophical, or educational. Sometimes these in-terests will coincide with your own; sometimes they won’t. Most of the time, the response comes in as programmed; occa¬sionally it doesn’t, or there is an additional, unexpected re¬sponse. Some of the media’s output has long lasting value and worth; some is not only cheap, tawdry, and superficial stuff, but physically, emotionally, and intellectually harmful. Answer the following questions. Comment on the meaning of \\"global village\\" and how it's connected with the TV.","output":"The term \\"global village\\" refers to the concept of the entire world becoming more interconnected and interdependent, as if shrinking into a village rather than vast, segregated geographical areas, primarily due to advancements in communication technologies. This concept, closely associated with media theorist Marshall McLuhan, suggests that electronic media, especially television, have the power to eliminate social and physical boundaries, bringing distant cultures and peoples into each other's living rooms and daily lives with immediacy and impact previously unattainable. Connected to television, the \\"global village\\" concept is manifest in the way TV content—be it news, documentaries, entertainment, or cultural programming—can originate from any corner of the world and be broadcast globally, allowing viewers everywhere to experience and learn about places, peoples, and perspectives far removed from their own locale. This widespread distribution of visual media plays a crucial role in shaping viewers' perceptions of the world, making them feel connected to global events and cultures in real-time. Moreover, through television, events of global significance, such as the Olympics, World Cup, royal weddings, or even solemn occasions like state funerals or moments of crisis, are shared experiences for millions, if not billions, of people around the globe. This shared consumption of content contributes to a sense of global community and shared humanity, reinforcing the idea of the \\"global village.\\" However, it's worth noting that while TV and other media can foster greater understanding and empathy across cultures, they also wield the power to shape narratives and influence perceptions through the selection, framing, and presentation of content. This dual capacity highlights the complex role television plays in both connecting and constructing the \\"global village.\\""},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

Sitting in the kitchen watching your mother cook supper or sitting in the living-room watching Captain Kangaroo?1 Which came first on Sunday morning — breakfast or the comics? Now bring your memories up to date. What did you and your friends talk about, at least part of the time, before class? An item from a newspaper? An ad that you noticed in a maga¬zine or a television commercial? An episode from a popular TV series? A movie? Or a new record that you heard on the radio? If your answers parallel those of most young people, you add to the proof that mass media play a large and influential part in your life. Your answers also prove just how casually you accept the media, just as you accept the house you live in, cars, electricity, telephones, your school, and your family as part of your environment. Parents and teachers agree that all young people growing up with the media learn from them sometimes more than adults wish you to. (And this is the cause for alarm.) If the use of them referring to media in the last sentence seems strange, remember that the word media linguistically is plural. When people make a fuss about the media being a bad influence, they usually are talking about television, the most powerful medium of all. Maybe calling television the media can be justified technically because, as a medium, it embraces functions of several media such as newspapers, magazines, movies, and recordings. The major media can be divided into two kinds, print and electronic. The print media — newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets, catalogues, circulars, brochures, anything you read — are the oldest, dating back to the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century. The electronic media — radio, television, films of all kinds, records, tapes, anything that is transmitted by the use of electricity — are less than a hundred years old. One of the problems facing us today is being reached by the media when we really don’t choose to be. Do you some¬times find it difficult to locate a moment of complete silence in your environment or a time when your eyes are not presented with signs, billboard, or pictures demanding attention? Another meaning the word mass suggests is “the people”, a phrase too often associated with adjectives like dull-witted, credulous, ill-informed, uncritical, and passive. Or are the mass of people well-informed, sophisticated, thoughtful, and active? Which are you? How much of what you know about yourself has been taught you by the media? You may not realize how greatly the media influence you because in your lifetime they have always been there, in fact, short of deliberate isolation on a mountain top or being lost in a forest and reared by wolves, no one will ever again grow up without the presence and influ¬ence of the mass media. Is this good or bad? ____________ 1Captain Kangaroo — a children’s morning television programme. An experiment recently conducted in Europe by the Society for Rational Psychology showed that watching television is psychologically addictive. The idea of becoming addicted to tele¬vision brings up questions involving subtle conditioning and brainwashing that could be friendly or vicious, altruistic or self-serving. In a commercial society the media’s ability to stimulate motivation to buy — almost as though people were puppets on strings — builds other people’s power. It can be power for good or power for bad, but it is always power for control. All these negative aspects of growing up with the media need consideration, at the same time you are enjoying the posi¬tive aspects of immediately knowing what’s going on in the world, sharing great entertainment and historical events with everyone else in our “global village”, and having the fun of try¬ing out a new product that you wouldn’t have known about without advertising. According to a recent research report, more than a third of all children by the age of three are viewing TV with some regularity and more than half are listening to books read to them. Before they are old enough for school — a third of the children are looking through magazines, 40 percent are listen¬ing to radio, and 80 percent are viewing television. At age sev¬en, newspapers enter a child’s life, usually through the comic strips. You are one of these children. As you grew, you absorbed uncritically, as children do. And what did you absorb? Hundreds of items of informa¬tion, most of them accurate as far as they went. Increasing so¬phistication of taste and appreciation of technical skills. High standards of performance by talented musicians and actors that sometimes make your teachers despair of competing effectively for your attention. With all this, you also absorbed ideas about behaviour, about right and wrong, good and bad, the permissible and the forbidden. These ideas were presented to you — and still are — directly and indirectly with the entertainment, advertis¬ing, and information. The most powerful ideas are the ones you absorb indirectly. They are digested emotionally at psychologi¬cal depths that we still know little about, although we can tell that the effect of reaching those depths is particularly strong and long lasting from behaviour patterns that emerge. … Another indicating of media influence is in the language we use.

How is it known that some attitudes are absorbed indirectly from the television and then retained?","output":"It is known that some attitudes are absorbed indirectly from television and then retained through the observation of behavior patterns that emerge over time. The text highlights that the most potent ideas and attitudes are those absorbed indirectly—integrated with entertainment, advertising, and information in ways that might not be consciously acknowledged by the viewers at the moment. These ideas are digested emotionally and reach psychological depths that have a particularly strong and long-lasting impact. This indirect absorption can shape viewers' perceptions, beliefs, values, and behavior in significant ways, often without their explicit realization. The capacity of television to influence attitudes and behaviors indirectly is also evidenced by changes in language, social norms, and cultural values that can be traced back to media content. For instance, new vocabularies and expressions, attitudes towards different social issues, and the perception of societal norms can reflect the influence of television and other forms of media. Additionally, numerous psychological and sociological studies support the idea that prolonged exposure to certain types of media content can lead to the assimilation of attitudes and behaviors depicted in those media. This might be observed in trends like increased aggression or altered standards of beauty, which can be correlated with media consumption patterns. The lasting nature of these attitudes becomes evident through consistent behavior patterns over time, suggesting a deep-rooted internalization of what was absorbed. This internalization process underscores the importance of critically engaging with media content and fostering media literacy skills to navigate the complex landscape of indirect influences."},{"instruction":"GROWING UP WITH THE MEDIA By P.

Answer the following questions. Does the television al¬ways achieve its intended predetermined response from its au-dience? Is it more successful than the other forms of media?","output":"The text suggests that while television aims to achieve a predetermined response from its audience, the outcome is not always as programmed. Although television is a potent medium, capable of influencing viewer's emotions, attitudes, and behaviors, it does not invariably succeed in eliciting a specific response. The effectiveness of television in achieving its intended outcomes can vary based on several factors, including the viewer’s individual experiences, critical thinking abilities, and the context in which the media content is consumed. Comparatively, although the text does not provide a direct comparison across all media forms, it implies that television, due to its audiovisual nature, might have a more substantial immediate impact than some other forms of media. It combines visual imagery with sound, making it a powerful tool for capturing and retaining the audience's attention and potentially influencing their attitudes and behaviors. This multisensory engagement can make television more influential than print media in certain contexts, especially in conveying messages that rely heavily on emotional appeals. However, the increasing role of digital media, particularly social media platforms, introduces new dynamics in media consumption that challenge television's primacy. These platforms allow for more interactive and engaging user experiences, which can be highly personalized and thus potentially more influential on an individual basis than traditional television broadcasting. In summary, while television is a powerful medium and often seeks to produce specific responses from its audience, it does not always succeed in doing so. Its effectiveness can be influenced by various factors, and it operates within an increasingly complex media landscape where other forms of media, especially digital, are becoming increasingly significant influencers."},{"instruction":"How independent are those people working for the tele¬vision companies?","output":"The text indicates that individuals working for television companies are not entirely independent in their roles. Their work is significantly influenced by the policies and desired outcomes of the media owners, whose interests can range from commercial to political, charitable, philosophical, or educational. These policies are described as sometimes intricate and interwoven strands, reflective of a larger commercial-military-governmental complex. Employees such as reporters, photographers, film or copy editors, script or continuity writers—regardless of whether they operate within print or electronic media—are subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) guided by the overarching agenda of the ownership. They \\"pick up\\" on what is expected of them through the workplace culture and the implicit understandings communicated within the organization. This absorption of the company's expectations occurs quickly, within \\"a week or two of accepting a job,\\" suggesting a strong influence on the content they produce that aligns with the owner's policies. Therefore, while individuals may have personal beliefs and journalistic integrity, the extent to which they can express their independence is likely constrained by the need to conform to the media outlet's editorial stance and commercial objectives. This dynamic affects the independence of those working in television (and media in general), as their primary job is to generate content that aligns with the predetermined response the media owners wish to elicit from the audience."},{"instruction":"In the last sentence the pros and cons of television are put rather bluntly.

Instead, the text outlines that television, and broader media consumption, have complex effects on individuals and society. On the one hand, television offers immediate knowledge of global events, entertainment, and the joy of experiencing new products and ideas, effectively making the world a smaller, more interconnected \\"global village.\\" This aspect of television can lead to increased awareness, shared cultural moments, and a broadened understanding of diverse perspectives. On the other hand, the text discusses the negative aspects of growing up with the media, such as psychological addiction to television, the potential for subtle conditioning and brainwashing, and the manipulation of consumer behavior. These influences hint at a more sinister form of control wielded by media proprietors, who can shape content to serve commercial, political, or ideological ends, often at the expense of the audience's autonomy or well-being. Given the complexity of these issues and the balanced presentation in the text, it does not offer a clear verdict on whether the positives outweigh the negatives or vice versa. Instead, it encourages readers to critically engage with the media they consume, being mindful of both its benefits and its potential to influence and manipulate. Therefore, the assessment of whether the positives or negatives of television outweigh each other may depend largely on individual perspectives, including one's experiences, values, and the extent to which one engages critically with media content."},{"instruction":"Kids WB Saturday Morning Lineup - May 2008 (My Version) 7:00 AM – Will and Dewitt Start the morning with the adventures of Will and his talking (and transforming) frog Dewitt as they face everyday challenges and learn important life lessons. 7:30 AM – Magi-Nation Follow the journey of Tony Jones, an average boy from Earth, who finds himself in the magical world of Magi-Nation battling evil creatures and solving mysteries. 8:00 AM – My Goldfish is Evil Jump into the comical struggles of a boy named Beanie and his pet goldfish, Admiral Bubbles, who plans world domination from his fishbowl. 8:30 AM – Ben 10 Watch Ben Tennyson discover the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that allows him to transform into ten different aliens, each with its own unique powers. 9:00 AM – Skunk Fu!

Write a forum convo in June 2008 with the first schedule change after it became CW4Kids, as of June 21 Chaotic, TMNT:FF and YGO GX arrive, also Spider Riders returns at 11:30, TSSM is now at 7:30am and here’s the new lineup User1: Hey everyone, have you seen the latest schedule change for the Saturday morning lineup on CW4Kids starting June 21? Looks like we’re getting some major shifts and new additions! User2: Yeah, I saw that! Chaotic, TMNT: Fast Forward, and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX are making their way into the lineup. I’m really excited about Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, been waiting for it to be televised again. User3: I’m a bit bummed about The Spectacular Spider-Man moving to 7:30 AM though. That’s way too early for me on a Saturday. It was perfectly placed at 10:00 AM before. User4: Did anyone notice Spider Riders is making a comeback at 11:30 AM? That’s quite a throwback. I wonder if it will pick up where it left off or start from the beginning again. User5: Here’s the new lineup for those who missed it: 7:00 AM – Will and Dewitt 7:30 AM – The Spectacular Spider-Man 8:00 AM – Chaotic 8:30 AM – Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward 9:00 AM – Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 9:30 AM – Ben 10 10:00 AM – Skunk Fu! 10:30 AM – Tom and Jerry Tales 11:00 AM – My Goldfish is Evil! 11:30 AM – Spider Riders User6: Interesting move adding Chaotic into the 8:00 AM slot. That show has a pretty solid fan base, and it might attract more viewers to the earlier time slots. User7: Kinda sad to see MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers didn’t make the cut. I know it was a made-up show, but the concept sounded cool. Boofus and Diggle would have made a fun addition. User8: I’m just here waiting for more Goldfish. That show is an absolute chaotic mess, but I love it. Glad it’s staying in its 11:00 AM slot. User9: Overall, I think the new lineup is a mixed bag. Some great additions, but the reshuffling of shows like The Spectacular Spider-Man to an earlier time is a letdown. Guess we’ll have to wait and see how it all pans out. User10: Agreed, @User9. It’s definitely going to take some time to adjust to this new schedule. But hey, more reason to get up early on Saturdays, I guess. Here’s hoping the changes bring in some good ratings for the network! Write a convo suprised at the show they kept instead of JT or MG User11: I’m genuinely surprised they kept “My Goldfish is Evil!” over choices like Johnny Test or Magi-Nation. Don’t get me wrong, I find the premise hilarious, but didn’t see it having as big a following! User12: Yeah, @User11, it’s a shocker for sure. “Johnny Test” especially has a wider appeal in my opinion. Wonder what drove the decision to prioritize an evil goldfish’s world domination plans. Love the humor in it, but still! User13: Honestly, I think it’s a bold move, keeping “My Goldfish is Evil!”. The show definitely stands out for its unique plot, maybe that’s what they’re banking on? Different doesn’t always mean bad. User14: I’m with @User13 on this. It’s refreshing to see them take a risk with something unconventional like “My Goldfish is Evil!”. Plus, “Johnny Test” and “Magi-Nation” had their runs. It’s good to mix things up. User15: Can’t help but feel disappointed, though. I was hoping “Johnny Test” would keep its spot; it’s got that mix of science, adventure, and humor that’s hard to beat. “My Goldfish is Evil!” is okay, but doesn’t fill that void for me. User16: Agree with @User15. There’s something about “Johnny Test” that’s just special – feels like it deserved to stay in the lineup. But who knows, maybe “My Goldfish is Evil!” will grow on us more now? User17: Surprising indeed, but let’s not forget the unpredictability of showbiz. Perhaps the network sees potential in “My Goldfish is Evil!” that we’ve yet to fully appreciate. Either way, curious to see how it all turns out. Write a convo about what's staying in September, especially that Smeshariki is out for the main comedic slot","output":"User18: Just saw the September update for CW4Kids. Looks like there are a few changes yet again. Surprised to see that Smeshariki is out. It was filling that main comedic slot pretty well. User19: Yeah, @User18, it's a bummer about Smeshariki. That show had a unique charm and humor that’s hard to find elsewhere. Wonder what they’re planning to replace it with for the comedy aspect. User20: I heard that “Loonatics Unleashed” might be making a return. Not exactly the same vibe as Smeshariki, but it has its moments. Could be an interesting shift in the comedic tone of the lineup. User21: “Loonatics Unleashed”? That’s a throwback. But, honestly, was hoping for something a bit lighter to fill Smeshariki’s shoes. That show had a way of brightening up Saturday mornings. User22: On a brighter note, “Tom and Jerry Tales” is staying on. At least we still have that classic slapstick humor to look forward to. There’s something timeless about Tom and Jerry’s antics. User23: True, @User22. “Tom and Jerry Tales” never gets old. I just hope the new changes bring in a good mix of adventure and comedy. The lineup could use a fresh yet familiar feel to it. User24: Is “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” sticking around? That’s one show I’ve been consistently tuning in for. It’s got a great combo of action and strategy, plus a bit of humor thrown in. User25: @User24, yes, “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” is staying put from what I’ve seen. It’s a staple for the lineup, so not surprised there. It does a great job of keeping things engaging with its battles and characters. User26: Sad to see some shows go, but I’m always intrigued to see what’s next. Hopefully, the September changes rejuvenate the lineup. Always looking for that perfect balance of humor, action, and adventure on Saturday mornings. User27: Agreed, @User26. It’s all about finding that sweet spot. While I’ll miss Smeshariki, I’m optimistic about what’s to come. After all, change can be good, and who knows? We might just find a new favorite."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where if you like monsters (but get sick a lot), then the show replacing Smeshariki is for you, Also Goldfish is saying","output":"User28: Heard through the grapevine that the show replacing Smeshariki is going to be a monster-themed one. Seems like it’s aimed at those who love a bit of the monstrous and fantastical. If you like monsters but get sick a lot, this might be the show to get hooked on from your couch! User29: That’s an interesting direction to take. Monster-themed shows have a way of sparking imagination. Hopefully, it'll have a good mix of humor and engaging storylines. And speaking of shows with unique concepts, glad to see “My Goldfish is Evil!” is staying. That show's ridiculousness is oddly comforting when you're homebound. User30: Yeah, @User29, “My Goldfish is Evil!” has that weirdly specific charm that makes it a perfect sick day binge. Now, adding a monster show into the mix? Sounds like CW4Kids is creating quite the niche for those under-the-weather Saturdays. User31: Any clues on what exactly this monster show entails? With Smeshariki out, I'm curious if they're aiming for a softer comedic touch or going full-on adventure with these monsters. User32: @User31, from what I’ve gathered, it might lean more towards adventure with a decent dose of humor. Think a group of kids stumbling across a hidden world of monsters – each episode exploring new creatures and the challenges they bring. User33: That premise sounds promising. There’s something inherently engaging about monster-world explorations. It’s the perfect escapade for the imagination, especially when you’re stuck at home feeling under the weather. User34: I’ll miss the quirkiness of Smeshariki, but I’m open to giving this new monster show a chance. And let’s be honest, “My Goldfish is Evil!” sticking around is a win. It’s like the comfort food of TV shows; always there when you need a laugh or just something to make your sick days less dull. User35: For sure, @User34. Between the new monster adventures and the evil goldfish’s antics, sounds like we’ve got our sick day entertainment sorted. Here’s hoping this monster show lives up to the intrigue and fills the comedic void left by Smeshariki. User36: Overall, I’m excited to see how this new addition shakes up the lineup. Monster adventures could bring a fresh dynamic to Saturday mornings. Plus, with “My Goldfish is Evil!” still in the mix, it sounds like we’re set for a blend of humor, adventure, and, well, more humor."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where a user pieces it together when User1 says, This boy feels sick, a lot, but he can see monsters","output":"User37: Wait a second, if we piece together what User1 just hinted at—\\"This boy feels sick, a lot, but he can see monsters\\"—are we talking about a show that centers on a boy who gets ill frequently and that somehow enables him to see or interact with monsters? That premise sounds both unique and intriguing! User38: Yeah, @User37, that's an interesting catch! It sounds like a clever way to weave the personal struggles of the protagonist with the fantastical element of monsters. If that's the direction the new show is taking, it’s definitely something fresh for the lineup. User39: I love the concept already! It's not just another monster adventure; it’s deeply personal and relatable. Being sick and feeling isolated is something many can resonate with, especially kids. This twist of the boy’s ability to see monsters might serve as a metaphor for finding the extraordinary in the midst of adversity. User40: @User39, well said! Plus, it adds a layer of depth to the character that could lead to some heartfelt storytelling. I’m imagining episodes where the monsters he interacts with could be allegories for his personal struggles, fears, or even hopes. This show could tackle some meaningful themes under the guise of monster adventures. User41: Do you think this concept could pivot the show towards a mix of genres? Like a hybrid between coming-of-age themes and the traditional monster-of-the-week format. It could attract a broader audience looking for more than just action and humor. User42: @User41, absolutely! Blending genres could make it a standout show, appealing to those who might be looking for something with a bit more emotional depth, alongside the usual monster-based entertainment. It’s a smart move, creating a bridge between different viewer interests. User43: Has there been any word on when this show will start airing? Based on this discussion, I’m genuinely excited to see how they execute the concept. A boy who can see monsters because he's often sick—that's a premise you don't hear every day! User44: No specific dates yet, @User43, but if the buzz is building up this much just from the premise, I’d say we’re looking at a potential hit. It’s rare to find shows that can balance personal struggles with fantastical elements without leaning too heavily on one side. I’m here for it! User45: Same here, @User44. It's refreshing to see animated shows tackling deeper themes while still providing that adventurous escape. This could be a great opportunity for discussions with kids about resilience, empathy, and imagination. Can’t wait to see how this boy's interactions with monsters unfold!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up with more details \\"The boy can tame monsters, is allergic to nearly everything, and is the only one who can see monsters\\", Also an update on the fate of W&D","output":"User46: Diving deeper into the details about this new show, I found out that the boy not only can see monsters—due to his frequent illnesses—but he can also tame them! Plus, he's allergic to nearly everything, which probably plays into why he's sick so often. This layered character detail adds so much more depth to the storyline. User47: That's fascinating, @User46! A protagonist who's both vulnerable because of his health and allergies, yet possesses this extraordinary ability to tame monsters, is a narrative goldmine. It’s like he draws strength from his challenges. This could be a great way to teach kids about overcoming personal obstacles. User48: I’m curious about the mechanics of him being the only one who can see these monsters. Is it a gift? A curse? And how does his ability to tame them play into his everyday life or the bigger picture of the show? There’s a lot of potential for character development and plot twists. User49: To add to the excitement, does anyone have updates on “Will and Dewitt”? I heard it might be facing changes or even cancellation. With the addition of this new monster-themed show, I wonder how it will affect the existing lineup, specifically niche favorites like “Will and Dewitt”. User50: From what I've gathered, “Will and Dewitt” is actually facing cancellation to make way for this new show. It seems the network is aiming to refresh their content and introduce more unique, character-driven stories. While it’s sad to see a show go, it’s understandable given the compelling premise of this new addition. User51: That's a shame about “Will and Dewitt”; it had a good run and offered some fantastic lessons for kids. However, this new shows sounds like it’s breaking the mold in children’s programming. A boy who's allergic to nearly everything but can tame monsters brings a whole new layer of representation and challenges to explore. User52: Agree, @User51. Shows that depict characters with health challenges in a positive light, showing them harnessing unique strengths, are incredibly valuable. It pushes the narrative beyond typical superhero stories to something more relatable and deeply inspiring for kids with their own struggles. User53: Here’s hoping the transition from “Will and Dewitt” is smooth and that the incoming show carves out its own loyal audience. The concept of taming monsters as an allegory for handling personal challenges could resonate on many levels with viewers, both young and not-so-young. User54: Absolutely, @User53. It’s all about how these stories are told and the impact they have on the audience. This show about a boy who can see and tame monsters, despite his allergies and frequent illnesses, might just set a new standard for storytelling in children’s programming.
