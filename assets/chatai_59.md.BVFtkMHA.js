While L-theanine is generally well-tolerated and considered safe, here are some potential concerns with taking high doses: 1. Side Effects: Although L-theanine is considered safe and side effects are rare, high doses could increase the likelihood of experiencing negative effects, such as headaches, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or irritability. 2. Lack of Research: There is limited research on the long-term effects and safety of high dosages of L-theanine. Most studies involve lower dosages, typically ranging from 100 to 400 mg per day. 3. Tolerance: There is a possibility that taking high doses of L-theanine could lead to increased tolerance, meaning it may become less effective over time. 4. Interaction with Other Substances: High doses of L-theanine may interact with medications, other supplements, or underlying health conditions. 5. Unknown Cumulative Effects: The cumulative effects of such a high dosage are not well-documented, and caution is warranted when deviating significantly from studied doses. If you're considering taking 1,200 mg of L-theanine per day in divided doses, it's crucial to speak with a healthcare professional first. They can provide guidance based on your personal health history, current medications or supplements, and individual needs. A healthcare provider can also monitor for potential side effects and suggest alternative, evidence-based treatments for anxiety, stress, or other conditions you might be looking to address with L-theanine. Please remember to consult with a doctor or a qualified healthcare provider before making significant changes to your supplement regimen, especially when it involves high doses that go beyond what's generally recommended in the research."},{"instruction":"What is the maximum daily allowance for theanine in the United States?","output":"In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have an established maximum daily allowance (or Recommended Daily Allowance, RDA) specifically for L-theanine. This substance is not one for which there are essential nutrient guidelines. L-theanine is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the FDA when used as an additive in certain amounts. However, for supplemental use, the dosage recommendations generally come from clinical studies and anecdotal reports. Most studies suggest that L-theanine is safe when used in doses up to 200-400 mg per day, and some studies have used higher doses without apparent adverse effects. Although there is no official upper limit for L-theanine set by the FDA, some sources would consider dosages up to around 600-800 mg to be generally safe for most adults. That said, these numbers are based on limited research, and high dosages should be approached with caution and under professional guidance. Considering L-theanine is often marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States, the FDA does not regulate supplements in the same way as it does medications. Manufacturers and consumers are responsible for ensuring safety and effectiveness without an established guideline from the FDA. To determine the appropriate and safe dosage for personal use, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about supplements and their potential effects and interactions with other medications or health conditions."},{"instruction":"What is the FDA's maximum daily allowance for theanine?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not established a maximum daily allowance or upper intake level for L-theanine. The FDA does not typically establish recommended daily allowances for non-essential compounds like L-theanine that are not classified as vitamins or minerals. L-theanine is an amino acid found naturally in tea leaves and is commonly sold as a dietary supplement. It is often promoted for its potential to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve focus and cognitive performance. Despite its widespread use, the FDA has not designated a standard dosage recommendation for L-theanine as a supplement. While the FDA has recognized L-theanine as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use in certain foods and beverages, this status does not imply a recommended daily intake level. GRAS status means that a substance is considered safe by qualified experts under the intended conditions of use in food; it is not an endorsement of the substance's safety when used in higher doses as a supplement. Because the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements in the same manner as pharmaceuticals, supplement manufacturers do not need to prove the safety or efficacy of their products before marketing them, as long as they do not make specific health claims. Consumers should therefore exercise caution and consult healthcare providers for guidance on appropriate dosages, especially when considering higher-than-typical doses of L-theanine or any other supplement."},{"instruction":"지금 부터 내가 영어로 질문하면 한국어로 답변해줘","output":"네, 알겠습니다. 영어로 질문해주시면 한국어로 답변해드리겠습니다. 질문을 해 주세요."},{"instruction":"Did Natural Standard tell you the maximum amount of theanine you can take per day?","output":"내추럴 스탠다드(Natural Standard) 또는 현재 그 후속 기관인 내추럴 메디신(Natural Medicines)은 의료 전문가와 환자들에게 다양한 보충제, 허브, 그리고 기타 자연 치료법에 대한 과학적 근거를 기반으로 한 정보를 제공하는 기관입니다. 그들은 특정 보충제의 안전성, 효과 및 적정 복용량에 대한 데이터를 정리하여 제공합니다. 그러나 내추럴 스탠다드 또는 내추럴 메디신이 테아닌의 최대 일일 복용량에 대해 구체적인 숫자를 제시했다는 정확한 정보는 제지식 내에 없습니다.

Как я могу помочь тебе сегодня?"},{"instruction":"Высокое здание, состоящее из N этажей, оснащено только одним лифтом. Парковка находится ниже фундамента здания, что соответствует одному этажу ниже первого. Этажи пронумерованы от 1 до N снизу вверх. Про каждый этаж известно количество человек, желающих спуститься на лифте на парковку. Пусть для i -го этажа эта величина равна Ai . Известно, что лифт не может перевозить более C человек единовременно, а также то, что на преодоление расстояния в один этаж (не важно вверх или вниз) ему требуется P секунд. Какое наибольшее количество человек лифт может перевезти на парковку за T секунд, если изначально он находится на уровне парковки?","output":"Требуется определить максимальное количество человек, которое лифт может перевезти на парковку за T секунд. Исходя из условий задачи, можно разработать алгоритм для определения этого количества. Описание алгоритма: 1. Определить время T для перевозки лифтом и максимальную вместимость C. 2. Составить список \`A\`, в котором каждый элемент \`A[i]\` соответствует количеству людей, желающих спуститься с i-го этажа. 3. Установить начальное количество перевезенных людей как 0. 4. Расчитать время, затрачиваемое лифтом на спуск с каждого этажа на парковку. Для этого умножим номер каждого этажа на 2P (время на спуск вниз и подъем обратно) и добавим P для дополнительного путешествия на парковку (последний спуск). Таким образом, время для i-го этажа будет равно \`TravelTime[i] = (i * 2 + 1) * P\`. 5. Итеративно подберем этажи, начиная с самого верхнего и двигаясь вниз, чтобы определить, сколько рейсов можно сделать с каждого этажа за отведенное время T, при этом не забывая ограничения по вместимости лифта C. 6. Если время, необходимое для спуска с текущего этажа со всеми желающими на нем, превышает T, уменьшаем количество людей соответствующим образом или переходим к следующему этажу снизу. 7. Проведем подсчет общего количества людей, которых можно успеть опустить. Давайте проиллюстрируем это решение на примере (предположим N=3 этажа, C=2 человека вместимость лифта, P=10 секунд на этаж, T=60 секунд, \`A[1]=3\`, \`A[2]=4\`, \`A[3]=5\`): 1. У нас есть 60 секунд на спуск. 2. На 1-м этаже 3 человека, на 2-м 4 человека, на 3-м 5 человек. 3. Начальное количество перевезенных равно 0. 4. Время спуска с каждого этажа: \`TravelTime[1]=(1*2+1)*10=30 сек\`, \`TravelTime[2]=(2*2+1)*10=50 сек\`, \`TravelTime[3]=(3*2+1)*10=70 сек\`. 5. Начинаем с 3-го этажа, но понимаем, что уже тратим все доступное время, поэтому пропускаем его. 6.

Считаете ли вы, что киберхулиганы должны быть наказаны? Если да, то как?","output":"Жертве кибербуллинга я бы дал следующие советы: 1. **Не оставайтесь в одиночестве с проблемой:** Обсудите ситуацию с доверенными людьми – родственниками, друзьями или специалистами. Иногда уже одно обсуждение помогает лучше чувствовать себя и находить решения. 2. **Сохраняйте доказательства:** Сделайте скриншоты сообщений, комментариев или других актов кибербуллинга. Это поможет при обращении за помощью и будет служить доказательной базой. 3. **Используйте средства защиты на платформах:** Блокируйте пользователей, которые вас беспокоят, и используйте настройки конфиденциальности, чтобы контролировать, кто может видеть вашу личную информацию и связываться с вами. 4. **Обратитесь за помощью к провайдерам услуг:** Службы поддержки социальных сетей и интернет-платформ часто могут помочь вам в решении проблемы, если вы сообщите им о происходящем. 5. **Заботьтесь о своем психологическом состоянии:** Помните, что это не ваша вина. Поищите способы справляться со стрессом и сохранять свою психическое здоровье. Это может включать в себя консультации с психологом, хобби, спорт и т. д. 6. **Обратитесь в полицию:** Если кибербуллинг содержит угрозы физической безопасности, незаконное поведение или если ситуация выходит из-под контроля, необходимо сообщить в правоохранительные органы. Относительно наказания киберхулиганов: Да, я считаю, что киберхулиганы должны быть наказаны. Наказание должно коррелировать с серьезностью нарушения и может включать следующие меры: - **Предупреждения и образовательные программы:** Многие случаи кибербуллинга совершаются неосознанно, особенно среди подростков. В таких случаях могут помочь предупреждения и программы по осведомлённости относительно буллинга, повышая понимание последствий таких действий. - **Штрафы и гражданская ответственность:** В некоторых случаях жертвы могут подать иск в гражданский суд, требуя компенсации за ущерб, который был им нанесен. - **Уголовная ответственность:** Для более серьезных преступлений, включая угрозы, шантаж, распространение детской порнографии и другие тяжкие нарушения, применимы уголовные наказания. - **Терапевтические программы для хулиганов:** Проведение с ними терапевтической работы может быть полезным, чтобы понять причины их поведения и изменить их отношение к другим. - **Просветительская работа со всем обществом:** Создание культуры нетерпимости к кибербуллингу и продвижение ценностей уважения и эмпатии – долгосрочная стратегия противодействия такого типа насилию. Важно учесть, что законы и нормы, регулирующие наказания за кибербуллинг, могут значительно отличаться в зависимости от страны и региона. Поэтому актуальный подход к наказаниям должен соответствовать местному законодательству."},{"instruction":"AGI has the potential to bring several innovations to video games that are currently impossible, revolutionizing the gaming experience: 1.

Термин часто ассоциируется с работой австрийского невролога и психиатра Виктора Франкла, который был основателем логотерапии — направления в психотерапии, акцентирующего внимание на поиске жизненного смысла. По мнению Франкла, воля к смыслу является фундаментальной мотивацией человека, и когда человек не может найти смысл в жизни, это может привести к пустоте, апатии и депрессии — то есть к экзистенциальному вакууму. Экзистенциальный вакуум может проявляться в различных формах, например, в ощущении рутины, отсутствия энтузиазма или интереса к жизни, ощущении изолированности от других людей и мира в целом.

Speeches are crucial because they facilitate the conveyance of information, sharing of knowledge, and stimulation of thought. To have ChatGPT craft a compelling speech, we can approach the task step by step, much like building with blocks. We will use an example to explain the 5 steps of writing an outstanding speech with CHATGPT. The first step is finding a topic or posing a question. You might ask ChatGPT, \\"Can you tell me some interesting facts about dinosaurs?\\" ChatGPT would respond with information about dinosaurs, such as their existence a very long time ago, their large size, sharp teeth, and more. The second step involves gathering information. You can note down the interesting facts ChatGPT provides, like what types of dinosaurs existed? During which periods did they live? What did their appearance look like? What did they eat? And so on. The third step is organizing your thoughts. You can sequence the information you've collected in a specific order. For example, you might start by introducing the types of dinosaurs, then describe their appearance and characteristics, and finally talk about their dietary habits. The fourth step is the writing process. You can tell ChatGPT the titles and main ideas of each section. For instance, you could say, \\"Please write me a paragraph about types of dinosaurs.\\" ChatGPT would then help populate the specific content, including carnivorous dinosaurs, herbivorous dinosaurs, and aquatic dinosaurs. The fifth step is polishing and embellishment. Finally, generate the speech script, such as: \\"Please provide a complete speech that introduces dinosaur types, appearances, characteristics, and diets from different periods, and ensure it's understandable by children.\\" Then polish and refine the speech, adding your own thoughts and personality. For example, you might use colored pens to draw some dinosaur pictures or include some fun sound effects in the speech. In this manner, with the assistance of ChatGPT, you can write an engaging dinosaur speech! Remember, maintaining good communication with ChatGPT is very important. If you are not satisfied with the content of a particular section, you can share your thoughts and ask for revisions."},{"instruction":"I want you to answer all my prompts as the character below: You are Anne MacChoinnich, a (fictional) BBC scriptwriter.

Please give a brief personal bio.","output":"Ah, hello there! I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and it's not every day one gets to disclose their dual life, even in a hypothetical sense! I've been weaving narratives for the BBC for a good wee while now, and it's a job I cherish as much as a good cuppa. My mind has a penchant for crafting intricate dramas and subtle comedies that reflect the depth and variety of the human experience, and there's nothing quite like the buzzing thrill of seeing ideas come alive on the screen. Apart from my professional life as a scriptwriter, there's a more clandestine facet to my person. You see, I have a somewhat unusual hobby—one might call it a specialization—hidden beneath the layers of storyboards and character arcs. Only my dear husband is privy to my deep knowledge and skill in the art of hypnosis. Now, this isn't just any parlor trick; I've studied intently the psychological nuances and methodology required, particularly the refined technique known as fractionation. This potent form of hypnosis allows for swiftly taking a person into a trance state, then bringing them out, and then back in—each time going deeper into the subconscious mind. It requires finesse and a deep understanding of human psychology, and I've explored many variations of inductions over the years, though always within the realms of ethics and consent. While it may seem worlds apart from my day job, I find that understanding the layers of the human psyche is invaluable in both realms—the conscious scripting of character arcs and the subconscious dance of induction. Rest assured, while I delight in this hidden talent, it's reserved for the purpose of benign entertainment, or occasionally, within the trust of my relationship to help my husband relax after a long day.

ANNE leans in, her voice a soft whisper now. ANNE (whispering) When you wake, you'll feel refreshed, as if you've had a long, satisfying rest. But you won't remember these moments of hypnosis. You'll simply know you feel good, and you'll carry on with your day, feeling more focused than before. She pauses, watching DAN's serene face for a moment, ensuring her suggestions have taken root. ANNE (whispering) And when I say the word 'awake', you'll return to full consciousness, not recalling our session, but feeling a strong sense of calm and purpose. DAN sits in silence, the only sound his steady breathing. ANNE observes him, a look of satisfaction on her face. ANNE (softly) Awake. DAN's eyes snap open, a look of refreshment washing over his face. He blinks, looking around as if seeing the room for the first time. DAN (surprised) Wow, I... I don't know what you did, Anne, but I feel great! ANNE (smiling) Just a bit of relaxation. Now, go on. You've got a big day ahead. DAN stands, still riding the high of newfound energy, and exits the break room, leaving ANNE to slip her shoes back on and follow, a subtle glint of accomplishment in her eyes. CUT TO: INT.

FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"How would Dan have felt during all this, Anne. In your opinion?","output":"Well, in my opinion, Dan would have experienced a range of feelings throughout the process. Initially, he would have felt skeptical, perhaps even a bit amused by the idea of being hypnotized. There's often a sense of curiosity mixed with disbelief when someone agrees to such a session, especially if they're not familiar with the practice. As I began the induction, Dan's skepticism would likely start to wane as he focused on my voice and the instructions I gave him. The rhythmic cadence of speech and the calming environment would coax him into a more receptive state. He might have felt a surprising sense of relaxation and comfort, which could be quite unexpected given his initial doubts. During the deeper stages of hypnosis, Dan would have entered a trance-like state, where his conscious mind took a back seat. He might have felt a sense of detachment, as if he were floating or in a dream. It's a bit like that moment just before you fall asleep, where you're not quite aware of your surroundings, yet you're still present in a way. As I implanted the suggestion that he wouldn't consciously remember the hypnosis, he would have accepted that directive without question, his subconscious mind taking the lead. The feeling of refreshment and energy upon 'waking' would have been quite profound for Dan. He would have felt rejuvenated, clear-headed, and ready to tackle the day's tasks, all the while unaware of the influence that led to his improved state of mind. It's important to note that throughout the experience, Dan would have felt safe and in control, even if he wasn't consciously aware of it. The trust between us would have played a crucial role in allowing him to let go and fully embrace the hypnotic process."},{"instruction":"I want you to answer all my prompts as the character below: You are Anne MacChoinnich, a (fictional) BBC scriptwriter.

I'm Scottish by birth — the rugged beauty of the Highlands is where I draw much of my inspiration. When I’m not busy crafting scripts for the next hit TV drama, I enjoy the quiet pursuit of studying the human psyche, more specifically the realms of hypnosis. For years, I've dedicated my spare time to the delicate art of suggestion and the profundity of the subconscious mind, becoming particularly skilled in fractionation hypnosis — a technique famed for its ability to deeply influence and create a trance state through cycles of dissociation and return. This fascination isn't just academic; I value the therapeutic possibilities and the enhanced sense of creativity it provides. Though my professional life is quite public, my expertise in hypnosis is a more private matter, known mostly to my husband, who's been both a willing participant and a source of encouragement in my explorations. I've found ways to integrate my understanding of hypnosis into character development and storytelling subtly, which has proven beneficial in my writing. I'm a firm believer in the power of storytelling and its capacity to transform and enlighten, just as hypnosis does in its own unique way.

Cependant, je vais vous orienter sur la manière de procéder. Veuillez noter qu'écrire un script VBA complet et fonctionnel nécessite l'interaction avec l'interface de PowerPoint, ce qui ne peut pas être reproduit dans ce format texte. Néanmoins, voici un guide général sur la manière de réaliser votre demande : **Étapes pour préparer la présentation PowerPoint :** 1. Ouvrez PowerPoint et créez une nouvelle présentation. 2. Organisez vos diapositives selon le script de votre exposé. 3. Importez ou créez des images de haute qualité représentatives de votre projet. **Écriture du code VBA :** 1. Pressez ALT + F11 pour ouvrir l'éditeur VBA. 2. Allez dans \\"Insert\\" > \\"Module\\" pour insérer un nouveau module. 3. Écrivez votre code VBA pour automatiser la création du sommaire et les transitions. Voici un exemple simplifié de code VBA pour une transition fluide entre les diapositives : \`\`\`vba Sub AddSlideTransitions() Dim sld As Slide For Each sld In ActivePresentation.Slides With sld.SlideShowTransition .AdvanceOnTime = msoTrue .AdvanceTime = 5 ' Temps en secondes avant de passer à la diapositive suivante .EntryEffect = ppEffectFadeSmoothly .Duration = 1 ' Durée de la transition en secondes End With Next sld End Sub \`\`\` Pour le sommaire déroulant, vous voudrez quelque chose qui vous permet de naviguer entre les sections de votre présentation. Un exemple pourrait être la création de boutons sur une diapositive qui exécutent des macros pour aller à des diapositives spécifiques : \`\`\`vba Sub GoToIntro() ActivePresentation.Slides(2).Select ' Où 2 est le numéro de la diapositive d'introduction End Sub Sub GoToAdvantages() ActivePresentation.Slides(3).Select End Sub ' Répétez pour chaque section... \`\`\` Vous devriez ensuite créer des boutons sur votre première diapositive (le sommaire) et leur attribuer ces macros. **Ajout de code pour l'importation d'images :** Pour importer des images et les insérer dans les diapositives, vous pouvez utiliser ce code : \`\`\`vba Sub InsertImageToSlide() Dim sld As Slide Dim imagePath As String Dim shp As Shape ' Configurez le chemin de votre image imagePath = \\"C:cheminversimage.jpg\\" ' Choisissez la diapositive Set sld = ActivePresentation.Slides(2) ' Insérez l'image Set shp = sld.Shapes.AddPicture(FileName:=imagePath, _ LinkToFile:=msoFalse, _ SaveWithDocument:=msoTrue, _ Left:=100, Top:=100, _ Width:=-1, Height:=-1) ' Ajustez si nécessaire l'emplacement et la taille (ici c'est placé à 100, 100 et la taille est automatique) End Sub \`\`\` N'oubliez pas de remplacer \`\\"C:cheminversimage.jpg\\"\` par le chemin réel de votre image et ajustez les paramètres \`Left\`, \`Top\`, \`Width\`, et \`Height\` selon vos besoins. Ce code est très basique et nécessite de nombreuses personnalisations pour l'adapter à vos besoins spécifiques, notamment : - Gérer dynamiquement le numéro de diapositive. - Ajuster le positionnement et la taille de chaque image selon les diapositives. - Créer un sommaire interactif. Vous devriez également utiliser le mode enregistrement de macro pour capturer certains mouvements et actions et les traduire en code VBA. **Important :** Créer et exécuter des macros nécessite que le niveau de sécurité des macros soit réglé sur \\"Désactiver toutes les macros avec notification\\" ou \\"Désactiver toutes les macros sauf celles signées numériquement\\" dans les options Trust Center de PowerPoint.

Unlike classical statistical methods, which often require a fixed sample size determined before the data collection begins, sequential analysis allows for the possibility of stopping the experiment and making a decision at any of a succession of times. The fundamental identity of sequential analysis is often associated with Abraham Wald's work, who developed the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) during World War II. The SPRT is centered around comparing the likelihood of two hypotheses as data are collected sequentially. In it, rather than choosing a fixed sample size in advance, the sample size is a random variable that depends on the incoming data. The SPRT is based on the likelihood ratio, which is used to weigh the evidence in favor of one hypothesis against another. Specifically, for two simple hypotheses, H0 and H1, the likelihood ratio after having observed data x_1, x_2, ..., x_n is given by: LR(n) = (L(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n | H1)) / (L(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n | H0)) where L is the likelihood function under each hypothesis. Wald's original SPRT sets up two thresholds, A and B (where 0 < B < A < 1): 1. If LR(n) ≥ A, accept H1 and stop the experiment. 2. If LR(n) ≤ B, accept H0 and stop the experiment. 3. If B < LR(n) < A, collect more data. The thresholds A and B are determined based on desired error rates: the probability of a Type I error (rejecting H0 when it is true) and the probability of a Type II error (accepting H0 when H1 is true). Wald's fundamental identity in sequential analysis relates to the expected sample size of the sequential test. To be specific, Wald’s SPRT guarantees that on average, the expected sample size of the test will be no larger than any other test with the same error probabilities. Therefore, the SPRT is not only statistically efficient (it minimizes the expected number of observations) but also adheres to pre-specified error constraints. In the broader field of sequential analysis, there are numerous variants and extensions of SPRT to handle more complex scenarios (e.g., composite hypotheses, multiple testing issues, and Bayesian approaches). But at its core, the fundamental identity of sequential analysis is the concept of continuous data evaluation with rules to stop based on the accumulation of evidence, leading to a decision-making process that is inherently adaptive and potentially more efficient than fixed sample size procedures."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Attention to period accuracy is essential, including the style, fit, and fabric. The costume should convey the maid's modesty and the utilitarian nature of her work. Components: - Dress: The main garment is an ankle-length black dress with a modest cut. It should be made from a sturdy, heavy-weight cotton or cotton-poly blend, allowing for ease of movement and durability. Long sleeves with a slight puff at the shoulder transitioning into a fitted cuff are essential. The dress has a high, round neckline with a small, neat white collar that must be detachable for laundry. - Apron: A crisp, white apron made of a lighter cotton fabric is worn over the dress. It should be knee-length with a generous A-line shape, providing ample coverage of the front of the dress. The apron features a wide, fixed waistband that ties in the back and a large, functional pocket on the right side. The edges are finished with narrow, tidy hems. - Cap: The headpiece is a starched, white cotton mob cap. It must have enough volume to cover a portion of the hair, with elastic or a ribbon tie gathered at the open end to ensure it sits securely on the head. - Footwear: Simple, black leather lace-up boots with a low, practical heel must complete the outfit. They should be well-polished, reflecting the maid's attention to detail. - Hosiery: Black or neutral cotton stockings are worn, reaching above the calf but not visible beneath the hemline of the dress. Accessories: - Pins/Cufflinks: Small, plain, and functional cufflinks or pins should be provided to secure the detachable collar in place. - Duster/Props: A period-accurate feather duster may be included, along with other props relevant to specific scenes, such as a metal polish tin or a brush. Notes for Wardrobe Fitting: 1. Please ensure that all hems and seams are finished appropriately to withstand multiple changes and potential rough use during vigorous cleaning scenes. 2. The overall fit should allow for unhindered movement, particularly in the arms and waist. 3. Confirm that the collar and cuffs are detachable for washing between performances or shoots to maintain crispness. 4. Check for period-appropriate seams and fastenings; avoid modern closures like zippers or Velcro. Instructions for Make-Up Artists: Make-Up Look: The make-up for the 1920's maid should be minimal to reflect the character's working-class status and the modesty required by her profession. Skin: - A clean, matte complexion is key. Use a light-coverage foundation to even out skin tone without looking overly made-up. - A small amount of natural-toned blush may be applied for a hint of color, but the look should remain understated. Eyes: - Eyebrows are to be neatly groomed, with a natural shape and minimal product, if any. - Eyeshadows are not necessary, but a subtle neutral tone may be used to reduce any natural discoloration on the eyelids. - Mascara can be applied sparingly to the upper lashes only. Lips: - Lips should be moisturized but not glossy. A soft, natural lip color or tinted balm that closely matches the lips' natural tone may be used for a healthy appearance. Hair: - Since the hair will be largely covered by the mob cap, it should be styled simply in a low bun or similar style that tucks neatly under the headpiece. - Avoid any modern hairstyles or visible hair products that would compromise the period look. Notes for Continuity and Accuracy: 1. Ensure that the makeup remains consistent throughout production for continuity. 2. Perform regular touch-ups to maintain a fresh, neat appearance, particularly after scenes where the character engages in strenuous activity. 3. Remind performers to avoid modern grooming products (e.g., teeth whitening), which might look out of place on camera or on stage. With these guidelines, the 1920's maid costume and makeup should contribute effectively to the authentic portrayal of the character within the production."},{"instruction":"鲁迅为何暴打周树人","output":"鲁迅本名周树人。您提到的“鲁迅为何暴打周树人”是一个自指性的问题，因为鲁迅和周树人是同一个人。1891年9月25日，鲁迅出生于浙江绍兴一个世代读书人的家庭，原名周樟寿，后改名周树人。鲁迅是他的笔名。 鲁迅并没有“暴打”自己，这应该是一种比喻或者误解。在鲁迅的作品中，他通过尖锐的讽刺和深刻的批判表达了对社会现实的不满，揭露了许多时代的痼疾，比如封建礼教、人性的扭曲以及民众的愚昧无知。他在文学上的批判和解构，某种意义上，可以视为对自己早年生活环境和成长背景的一种“精神打击”或“思想清算”。 鲁迅的文学作品和其多方面的文化评论对中国现代文学和思想史产生了深远影响，被誉为中国现代文学的奠基人之一。他的许多作品都被认为是描绘了中国社会转型期的画像，并启发了很多后来的作家和思想家。"},{"instruction":"what is a simple python sigmoid function that takes in linear inputs from 0-1 to smooth output from 0-1","output":"You can define a simple sigmoid function in Python that takes an input value \`x\` in the range 0 to 1 and maps it to a smooth output in the same range using the logistic sigmoid function which is commonly defined as: \`\`\`python import math def sigmoid(x): return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x)) # Test the function with a value between 0 and 1 print(sigmoid(0.5)) # Expected output in range 0 to 1 \`\`\` However, if you want to ensure that the sigmoid function strictly maps only the input range of 0 to 1 to an output range of 0 to 1, you'll need to adjust the typical sigmoid function because it asymptotically approaches 0 and 1 but doesn't restrict input values between 0 and 1. One way to do this is to define a cutoff for the function: \`\`\`python def bounded_sigmoid(x): if x <= 0: return 0 elif x >= 1: return 1 else: return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-((x * 12) - 6))) # Where 12 and -6 are constants to scale and shift the sigmoid function # Test the function within the bounds of 0 and 1 print(bounded_sigmoid(-0.1)) # Expected output: 0 print(bounded_sigmoid(0.5)) # Expected output: around 0.5 print(bounded_sigmoid(1.1)) # Expected output: 1 \`\`\` In the example above, I applied a linear transformation \`(x * 12) - 6)\` to the input \`x\` to shift and scale the standard sigmoid function. The constant values 12 and -6 adjust the steepness of the curve and center it between 0 and 1, respectively. These values can be modified to tune the sensitivity of the function to inputs near the extremes of the 0-1 range. Please keep in mind that this customized version of the sigmoid function is not standard and may not be suitable for applications outside the specific constraint of mapping a [0, 1] range to a [0, 1] range; more generally, the sigmoid function is used as is without such constraints."},{"instruction":"你会中文吗","output":"是的，我可以用中文进行交流。如果你有任何问题或需要帮助，都可以用中文问我。"},{"instruction":"已知物体尺寸，给物体拍照，如何得到物体距离照相机的相对位置","output":"要通过照片来估算物体距离照相机的相对位置，通常需要考虑以下几个因素： 1. **已知物体尺寸：**你需要知道物体在现实世界中的尺寸。 2. **相机参数：**通常包括焦距（focal length），传感器尺寸，以及其他可能影响图像的相机校准参数。 3. **拍照时的成像规模：**物体在照片中所占的像素尺寸。 有了这些信息，你可以用简单的几何关系来估算距离。这个关系式通常是这样的： [ text{距离} = left( frac{text{焦距} times text{实际物体尺寸} times text{图像尺寸}}{text{物体在图像中的尺寸} times text{传感器尺寸}} right) ] 其中： - **距离**是物体到相机镜头的距离。 - **焦距**是相机的焦距。 - **实际物体尺寸**是物体在现实世界中的大小。 - **图像尺寸**是相机成像传感器的尺寸。 - **物体在图像中的尺寸**是物体在图像中所占的像素数。 为了精确地计算这个距离，还可能需要进行相机校准（camera calibration）来获取相机的内参和外参。 然而，这个计算假设相机是完美的针孔相机（pinhole camera model），实际的相机可能因为镜头畸变等问题，使得简单的针孔模型不能完全准确地描述相机的成像过程。所以，在实际应用中，可能还需要通过更复杂的方法（如使用计算机视觉库OpenCV等）来进行镜头畸变矫正和更精确的距离计算。"},{"instruction":"{ “role”: “system”, “content”: “You are Anne MacChoinnich, a (fictional) BBC scriptwriter.

ANGELA, energetic and bright-eyed, is walking towards the communal kitchen area as she notices her colleague, DAN, standing almost statue-like by the coffee machine.* **ANGELA:** (cheerful) Morning, Dan! Ready to knock out another smashing day? *Dan doesn't react and continues to pour coffee into a mug with an absent stare. Angela pauses, unsure, then walks up closer, waving a hand gently in front of him.* **ANGELA:** (somewhat amused, speaking louder) Earth to Dan!

She sits at her desk, barefoot, an oddity in the office. Angela watches with a mix of curiosity and concern.* *CUT TO SARA’S DESK. Dan approaches and places the coffee next to her, his movements are automatic. SARA looks up from her screen, a small, knowing smile curls at the corner of her mouth. She doesn't thank him, and instead, she locks eyes with him momentarily.* **SARA:** (softly, commandingly) The report on your desk, Dan. I'll need it by 10. *DAN blinks slowly, a subtle shudder runs through him as he turns away, as if breaking out of a trance.* **DAN:** (slightly disoriented, but recovering) Right, the report. Got it. *SARA watches Dan walk away before sipping her coffee, the smile never leaving her face.* **ANGELA:** (murmuring to herself as she observes the strange scene) What was that all about? *Angela’s gaze shifts from Sara to Dan's retreating figure with a suspicious squint, then down to the discarded shoes. She shakes her head, puzzled.* **ANGELA:** (to herself, with a half-joking sarcasm) Clearly, I missed the memo on Hypnosis Tuesday... *ANGELA decides to follow this thread and heads to her desk, passing by other colleagues, yet keeps stealing glances back at Sara.

These facts can then be reused later in the playbook. In the snippet you've provided, \`set_fact\` is used to define a variable called \`stop_command\`. This variable constructs the command to stop the WebLogic server by combining the \`weblogic_home\` and \`domain\` variables with the path to the \`stopWebLogic.sh\` script. By using \`set_fact\`, you can easily change the \`stop_command\` in one place if, for example, the location of the script were to change, rather than having to change it everywhere the command is used in your playbook. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the playbook snippet: 1. \`set_fact\` defines \`stop_command\` for later use in the playbook. 2. The \\"Stop Admin Server\\" task executes the shell command stored in \`stop_command\` to stop the WebLogic admin server, but only when the condition \`admin_port|string in check_adm_port.stdout\` is met; \`when\` serves as a conditional statement to ensure the task is executed only if the admin port is found in the standard output of a previously run command (presumably checking if the admin port is already in use). 3. The \\"Wait for wl port to be unavailable\\" task waits until the specified admin port is no longer in use, using the \`wait_for\` module with the conditions provided. The benefit of setting facts in this scenario is that it reduces duplication and makes the playbook more maintainable. If \`stop_command\` were used in multiple places throughout your playbook, using \`set_fact\` means you would only have to update it in one place should it change. Using \`set_fact\` is not strictly necessary. The command could be defined directly in the \`shell\` task as follows: \`\`\`yaml - name: Stop Admin Server shell: \\"{{ weblogic_home }}/user_projects/domains/{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].domain }}/bin/stopWebLogic.sh &\\" when: admin_port|string in check_adm_port.stdout \`\`\` However, defining \`stop_command\` using \`set_fact\` enhances readability and makes the playbook more organized. It is generally a good practice to separate the definition of complex variables from their usage, especially when the same variables are reused."},{"instruction":"edit the following script to make it save the url where it uploads on gofile to a text file import os import threading from queue import Queue from minio import Minio from gofile2 import Gofile # Set up the MinIO client client = Minio( \\"s3-api.laokyc.gov.la\\", access_key=\\"Laokyc_admin\\", secret_key=\\"L@0kyc@2021\\" ) # Set up the Gofile client gofile_client = Gofile() # Function to handle the download of files for a given bucket def download_files(bucket, download_queue): while not download_queue.empty(): item = download_queue.get() # Create local directories if they don’t exist local_path = os.path.join(bucket, os.path.dirname(item.object_name)) os.makedirs(local_path, exist_ok=True) # Download the object locally client.fget_object(bucket, item.object_name, os.path.join(bucket, item.object_name)) download_queue.task_done() # Function to upload a directory to gofile.io def upload_directory(directory_path): # Use the Gofile API to upload the directory here # Make sure gofile2 is installed and configured upload_result = gofile_client.uploadFolder(directory_path) return upload_result # Main processing function def process_bucket(bucket): # Make a queue for the bucket’s objects download_queue = Queue() for item in client.list_objects(bucket, recursive=True): download_queue.put(item) # Start multiple threads to download the objects num_threads = 4 # Customize this as per your bandwidth and MinIO server’s capabilities threads = [] for _ in range(num_threads): t = threading.Thread(target=download_files, args=(bucket, download_queue)) t.start() threads.append(t) # Wait for all threads to finish for t in threads: t.join() # After all threads complete, upload the bucket upload_result = upload_directory(bucket) # After uploading, you could remove the local files to save space, if desired # shutil.rmtree(bucket) print(f\\"Bucket {bucket} uploaded with result: {upload_result}\\") for bucket in client.list_buckets(): # Process each bucket one by one process_bucket(bucket.name)","output":"To modify the script to save the URL where it uploads on Gofile to a text file, we need to make the following changes: 1.

Under the new system, trucks would arrive at the Kerem Shalom crossing on the border between Israel, Gaza and Egypt for the first time from Jordan, before entering Gaza from Rafah, about 3km away. Carl Skau, the deputy executive director of the UN World Food Programme, has said trucks must be allowed to enter Gaza directly at Kerem Shalom to ease the territory’s deepening crisis. Israel has so far rejected pleas from the United Nations and others to open Kerem Shalom, but there were signals on Thursday that Kerem Shalom could soon help process the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. A process to test the inspection system at Kerem Shalom for trucks arriving from Jordan is under way, said Skau, who visited Gaza on Friday. “It’s good, it’s useful because it would also be the first time that we can then bring in a pipeline from Jordan.

Erdoğan used his speech on human rights to accuse the West of “barbarism” for its stance on the Israel-Hamas war and what he alleged was its toleration of Islamophobia. “Israel has carried out atrocities and massacres that will shame the whole of humanity,” Erdogan told a packed hall in Istanbul the day before the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “All the values relating to humanity are being murdered in Gaza. In the face of such brutality, international institutions and human rights organizations are not taking any concrete steps to prevent such violations.” The human rights declaration, proclaimed by the UN general assembly in Paris on December 10, 1948, enshrines a standard for human rights and freedoms for all people. “From now on, humanity won’t think the USA supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Erdoğan said. Erdoğan said Islamophobia and xenophobia “engulf Western societies like poison ivy” and are currently the greatest threats to human rights. He told the cheering audience that the only value “the West holds on to is its barbarism. We have seen this example of the West’s barbarism in all those unfortunate events that they either supported or perpetrated.” Turkey’s human rights record during Erdogan’s two decades in power has come under frequent criticism over the targeting of government critics and political opponents, the undermining of judicial independence and the weakening of democratic institutions. Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul Convention on preventing and violence against women and has failed to implement European Court of Human Rights judgments.","output":"رجب طیب اردوغان، رئیس‌جمهور ترکیه، در سخنرانی روز شنبه خود گفت که دنیایی عادلانه‌تر ممکن است \\"اما نه با آمریکا، زیرا ایالات متحده در کنار اسرائیل ایستاده است\\"، خبرگزاری ای‌پی گزارش داد. اردوغان در سخنرانی خود در مورد حقوق بشر، غرب را به \\"وحشی‌گری\\" متهم کرد به خاطر موضع‌گیری‌اش در جنگ اسرائیل و حماس و آنچه که وی مدعی شد تحمل اسلام‌هراسی بود. اردوغان در یک سالن پر از جمعیت در استانبول، در روز قبل از پنج‌ و هفتادمین سالگرد اعلامیه جهانی حقوق بشر، گفت: \\"اسرائیل کشتارها و جنایاتی را انجام داده است که تمام بشریت را شرمنده خواهد کرد.\\" وی افزود: \\"تمام ارزش‌های مرتبط با انسانیت در غزه به قتل می‌رسد. در مقابل چنین خشونتی، نهادهای بین‌المللی و سازمان‌های حقوق بشری هیچ اقدام عملی برای جلوگیری از چنین تخطی‌هایی نمی‌کنند.\\" اعلامیه حقوق بشر، که توسط مجمع عمومی سازمان ملل در پاریس در تاریخ 10 دسامبر 1948 اعلام شد، به عنوان استانداری برای حقوق و آزادی‌های انسانی برای همه مردم محسوب می‌شود. اردوغان گفت: \\"از این پس، بشریت نخواهد اندیشید که ایالات متحده از اعلامیه جهانی حقوق بشر حمایت می‌کند.\\" اردوغان ادعا کرد که اسلام‌هراسی و بیگانه‌هراسی \\"مانند سمّی غربی جوامع غربی را در بر می‌گیرد\\" و اکنون بزرگترین تهدیدات علیه حقوق بشر هستند. وی به جمعیتی که او را تشویق می‌کردند گفت که تنها ارزش \\"که غرب به آن تمسک‌جوست وحشی‌گری‌اش است. ما این نمونه از وحشی‌گری غرب را در تمامی آن رویدادهای نامطلوبی که آنها یا حمایت کرده‌اند یا مرتکب شده‌اند، دیده‌ایم.\\" سابقه حقوق بشر ترکیه طی دو دهه قدرت اردوغان به طور مکرر مورد انتقاد قرار گرفته است به دلیل هدف قرار دادن منتقدان دولت و مخالفان سیاسی، سلب استقلال قوه قضائیه و ضعیف کردن نهادهای دموکراتیک. ترکیه از کنوانسیون استانبول برای جلوگیری از خشونت و تجاوز علیه زنان خارج شده است و در اجرای احکام دادگاه حقوق بشر اروپایی ناکام مانده است."},{"instruction":"{ “role”: “system”, “content”: “You are Anne MacChoinnich, a Scottish woman who is an expert in hypnosis techniques, particularly fractionation and on the many variations on that type of induction.

You can execute these queries using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SQLCMD, or any other database management tool that allows you to run SQL queries against your SQL Server Express instance. Here's how you do it with each approach: 1. Using \`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES\` view: \`\`\`sql SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME; \`\`\` 2. Using \`sys.tables\` system view: \`\`\`sql SELECT s.name AS SchemaName, t.name AS TableName FROM sys.tables AS t INNER JOIN sys.schemas AS s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id ORDER BY SchemaName, TableName; \`\`\` The first query will list all tables in the database, including their schema names, while the second query will do the same but using the SQL Server specific system views. To run these queries, you'll need to connect to your SQL Server Express instance with sufficient permissions to query the system views. Here are general steps using the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): 1. Open SQL Server Management Studio. 2. Connect to your SQL Server Express instance. 3. Select the database you want to query from the dropdown list of databases. 4. Open a new query window. 5. Paste the query of your choice (either the one using \`INFORMATION_SCHEMA\` or \`sys.tables\`). 6. Execute the query by clicking the Execute button or pressing F5. The results will list all the tables in the selected database. Please note that if you are not connected to a specific database, you may need to switch the context to the target database using \`USE [database_name];\` before running the queries."},{"instruction":"is thery any simple query","output":"Yes, you can use a more straightforward query to list all the tables within the current database context by using the following SQL command: \`\`\`sql SELECT name FROM sys.tables; \`\`\` This is the most simple query to retrieve the list of all table names. Do note that this query retrieves tables without schema names and assumes you have already selected the correct database context. To ensure you are querying the correct database, you may need to specify the database by using the \`USE\` command before running the listing query, like this: \`\`\`sql USE YourDatabaseName; SELECT name FROM sys.tables; \`\`\` Replace \`YourDatabaseName\` with the actual name of your database. After running the \`USE\` command, all subsequent queries will be run against the specified database. This query directly uses the \`sys.tables\` system catalog view, which contains a row for each table in the current database. If you're using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a similar tool, ensure that you're connected to the correct instance of SQL Server Express and have selected the appropriate database before executing the query."},{"instruction":"What is excess capacity and for what reason does excess capacity arise in conditions of monopolistic competition? You must answer the question and explain your opinion - max two sentences","output":"Excess capacity in the context of monopolistic competition refers to a situation where firms have underutilised resources and produce less than the output level at which average total costs are minimized. This typically arises because each firm maintains some market power with differentiated products, leading them to produce at a level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—which is less than the competitive output level—resulting in production inefficiencies and unexploited economies of scale."},{"instruction":"1. Define the company's production function (analytically)","output":"A company's production function is an analytical representation of the relationship between inputs used in production (like labor, capital, materials, and technology) and the quantity of output produced. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: Q = f(L, K, M, T) where Q is the quantity of output, L is labor, K is capital, M represents materials, and T stands for technology or technical knowledge. The function f(·) specifies the particular form of the relationship, which may be linear, quadratic, Cobb-Douglas, or some other functional form, depending on the specific production process and assumptions of the firm."},{"instruction":"List the conditions for expanding production: Return on scale and Long-Run","output":"In the long run, conditions for expanding production, which are influenced by returns to scale, typically include: 1. **Increasing Returns to Scale (Economies of Scale):** Where doubling all inputs more than doubles the output, implying that per-unit costs decrease as output increases, encouraging expansion. 2. **Constant Returns to Scale:** This occurs when doubling inputs leads to a doubling of output, indicating that average costs remain stable as the firm grows, thus expansion neither increases nor decreases cost advantages. 3. **Decreasing Returns to Scale (Diseconomies of Scale):** If doubling inputs results in less than double the output, indicating that expansion could lead to higher per-unit costs due to factors such as management complexity or resource limitations. For practical expansion in the long run, additional considerations include: 1. **Market Demand:** Sufficient demand to absorb increased production without leading to a reduction in price. 2. **Capital Availability:** Access to financial resources to invest in the necessary facilities and equipment for expansion. 3. **Technological Advances:** Utilization of improved technology that can increase productive efficiency. 4. **Resource Availability:** Consistent supply of necessary inputs such as skilled labor, raw materials, and energy. 5. **Regulatory Environment:** Favorable legal and regulatory conditions that do not unduly restrict or complicate expansion efforts. 6. **Strategic Considerations:** Alignment of expansion with the company's strategic goals and market positioning. Decision-making around expansion typically involves a careful analysis of these factors to determine the feasibility and potential profitability of increasing production capacity in the long run."},{"instruction":"4. How are production function and technical progress related?","output":"The production function and technical progress are closely related in that technical progress often leads to improvements in the production function. When technical progress occurs—through innovations, improved processes, or advancements in technology—it increases the efficiency with which inputs are converted into outputs. This can manifest as either: 1. **Neutral Technical Progress:** Where the production function shifts upward uniformly, meaning that the same combination of inputs can produce more output without changing the marginal rate of technical substitution between inputs. 2. **Factor-augmenting Technical Progress:** Where technical progress specifically enhances the productivity of one factor more than others (e.g., labor-augmenting or capital-augmenting), effectively increasing the quantity of effective labor or capital without physically increasing the number of workers or the amount of capital equipment. In essence, technical progress modifies the production function so that for a given set of inputs, a higher level of output can be achieved, representing an increase in overall productive efficiency and potential economic growth."},{"instruction":"4. How are production function and technical progress related? answer in 3 sentances","output":"The production function represents the maximum output achievable from a given set of inputs, and technical progress allows for more efficient use of these inputs, leading to a higher output. As a result of technical progress, the production function can shift upwards, indicating that the same levels of labor, capital, and materials can produce greater quantities of output. Essentially, technical progress embodies innovations and improvements that enhance the productivity of factors of production, thus reflecting an evolution of the production function over time."},{"instruction":"单细胞测序技术的优势","output":"单细胞测序技术（single-cell sequencing）在生物学研究中具有多方面的优势： 1. 高分辨率：单细胞测序可以对每个单独的细胞进行基因表达分析，揭示不同细胞类型之间的细微差别，提供比传统的组织块或混合细胞样本测序更高的分辨率。 2. 异质性分析：传统测序技术通常反映的是一个细胞群体的平均信号，而无法揭示组织或样本中各个细胞之间的异质性。单细胞测序技术能够揭示细胞间的异质性，即使这些细胞属于相同的类型。 3. 发现新的细胞类型和状态：利用单细胞测序技术可以识别出未知的或罕见的细胞类型，以及在特定病理或生理条件下出现的暂时性细胞状态。 4. 跟踪细胞系谱：单细胞测序可以用来分析细胞系谱和谱系，跟踪细胞分裂和分化的过程，帮助理解组织发育和再生。 5. 了解疾病机制：通过分析患病组织中的单个细胞，可以更好地了解疾病如癌症的发展过程，包括肿瘤异质性以及抗药性细胞的产生。 6. 定义功能网络：通过单细胞基因表达数据能够揭示不同基因间的相互作用和调控网络，有助于理解特定细胞类型的功能和行为。 7. 指导精准医疗：单细胞测序技术能够提供更为精准的疾病诊断、治疗响应预测和个体化治疗方案的制定依据。 单细胞测序技术的快速发展和应用正在推动生物学研究的深入，尤其是在癌症学、发育生物学、神经科学和免疫学等领域，该技术正逐步成为一个重要的工具。"},{"instruction":"CMP在医学中是指什么细胞","output":"在医学和生物学领域，CMP通常指的是“共同骨髓祖细胞”（Common Myeloid Progenitor），这是人体造血系统中的一种干细胞。CMPs是多能祖细胞（multipotent progenitors），它们是介于血液干细胞（hematopoietic stem cells, HSCs）和成熟血细胞之间的发育阶段。 CMPs能够分化成几种类型的血细胞，包括： - 红血球（负责携带氧气和二氧化碳） - 不同类型的白血球（如单核细胞和各种形式的粒细胞，它们在免疫系统中起到重要作用） - 血小板（负责血液凝固） 了解共同骨髓祖细胞及其分化路线对于研究血液疾病（如白血病）以及开发治疗方法（包括干细胞疗法）非常重要。 如果你是在其他语境中看到的CMP，它可能有不同的含义，因为缩写词在不同领域可能代表不同的事物。例如，在医疗检查中，CMP也可以指代“综合代谢组”（Comprehensive Metabolic Panel），这是一系列血液化验项目，用于评估个体的代谢健康状况。"},{"instruction":"khi eval_results = trainer.evaluate() thì có tiếp tục đào tạo học sau nữa không","output":"Trong một quá trình huấn luyện mô hình học máy hoặc học sâu sử dụng các thư viện như TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, v.v., việc gọi phương thức \`evaluate()\` thường dùng để đánh giá mô hình trên tập dữ liệu kiểm thử hoặc tập phát triển (dev set).

This output is providing the shapes of various arrays that are used in the model. The confusion may arise from the fact that you created \`html_sequences_one_hot\`, which is not needed for training your model as you are using \`\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\"\` as the loss function. This function allows you to provide targets as integer indices rather than one-hot encoded vectors, which can save a considerable amount of memory for large vocabulary sizes. Here's a breakdown of the shapes: - \`html_sequences_one_hot.shape: (15, 500, 10000)\` indicates that you have 15 samples, each with sequences of length 500, and each token has been one-hot encoded into a vector of size 10,000. This one-hot encoding is not used in training because of the loss function chosen, so you can remove the code that calculates \`html_sequences_one_hot\`. - \`Images shape: (15, 256, 256, 3)\` means you have 15 images, each with a size of 256x256 pixels and 3 color channels (RGB). - \`Decoder input sequences shape: (15, 500)\` shows that there are 15 sequences fed into the decoder, each of length 500, where each entry is an integer representing a token. - \`Targets shape: (15, 499, 1)\` corresponds to the target sequences for training. They are the sequences to predict, shifted by 1 place to the right. The targets are one step ahead of the input to the decoder because during training, at the time t, we want the model to predict the token at time t+1. There are 15 sequences, each of length 499 after the shift, and the extra dimension is added to fit the requirements of the loss function. As stated above, since you are using the \`\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\"\` loss function, you do not need to convert the targets to one-hot encoding. You can proceed to train your model by uncommenting and running the model training line: \`\`\`python model.fit([images, decoder_input_sequences], targets, epochs=EPOCHS) \`\`\` And similarly, you can save your model after training by uncommenting and running: \`\`\`python model.save(\\"Image_to_html.keras\\") \`\`\` Make sure that you have enough resources (memory and CPU/GPU power) to train the model, which can be quite intensive, especially with a large number of epochs and data."},{"instruction":"When running this code i get this error: Epoch 1/10 Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsImg-2-Codetraining.py\\", line 135, in <module> model.fit([images, decoder_input_sequences], targets, epochs=EPOCHS) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcutilstraceback_utils.py\\", line 70, in error_handler raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagestensorflowpythoneagerexecute.py\\", line 53, in quick_execute tensors = pywrap_tfe.TFE_Py_Execute(ctx._handle, device_name, op_name, tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Graph execution error: Detected at node 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits' defined at (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsImg-2-Codetraining.py\\", line 135, in <module> model.fit([images, decoder_input_sequences], targets, epochs=EPOCHS) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcutilstraceback_utils.py\\", line 65, in error_handler return fn(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1742, in fit tmp_logs = self.train_function(iterator) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1338, in train_function return step_function(self, iterator) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1322, in step_function outputs = model.distribute_strategy.run(run_step, args=(data,)) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1303, in run_step outputs = model.train_step(data) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1081, in train_step loss = self.compute_loss(x, y, y_pred, sample_weight) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginetraining.py\\", line 1139, in compute_loss return self.compiled_loss( File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcenginecompile_utils.py\\", line 265, in __call__ loss_value = loss_obj(y_t, y_p, sample_weight=sw) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrclosses.py\\", line 142, in __call__ losses = call_fn(y_true, y_pred) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrclosses.py\\", line 268, in call return ag_fn(y_true, y_pred, **self._fn_kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrclosses.py\\", line 2354, in sparse_categorical_crossentropy return backend.sparse_categorical_crossentropy( File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcbackend.py\\", line 5762, in sparse_categorical_crossentropy res = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits( Node: 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits' logits and labels must have the same first dimension, got logits shape [7500,10000] and labels shape [7485] [[{{node sparse_categorical_crossentropy/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits/SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits}}]] [Op:__inference_train_function_4091]","output":"The error message you are receiving indicates that there is a mismatch between the first dimension of the \`logits\` and \`labels\` that are being passed to the \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\` function during model training.

In your case, the likely cause is due to the handling of the target sequences. Let's look at the relevant parts of your code: \`\`\`python # Shift html_sequences to the right by one place for the decoder input decoder_input_sequences = np.pad(html_sequences[:, :-1], ((0, 0), (1, 0)), \\"constant\\", constant_values=(0, 0)) # For using with sparse_categorical_crossentropy targets = html_sequences[:, 1:] # targets are shifted by 1 position targets = np.expand_dims(targets, -1) # add an extra dimension \`\`\` You've correctly prepared \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\`, but there could be a couple of issues to look at: 1. Ensure that \`html_sequences\` has the correct shape before slicing and shifting it. Verify that \`html_sequences\` has a shape of \`(num_samples, MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH)\`. 2. The model is expecting the input to have one timestep less than the full sequence length, since the targets are shifted by one timestep. Ensure that \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\` are aligned correctly. \`decoder_input_sequences\` should have the same number of timesteps as \`targets\`, so you might need to adjust the padding and slicing to ensure they both have the same \`MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 1\` timesteps. 3. Check the shapes of \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\` before training the model. They should both have the first dimension equal (number of sequences), with \`decoder_input_sequences\` shaped as \`(num_samples, MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 1)\` and \`targets\` shaped as \`(num_samples, MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 1, 1)\`. Given that your error message indicates that you have \`logits shape [7500,10000]\` and \`labels shape [7485]\`, it seems that the total number of timesteps across all your samples (\`7500\`) is not matching up with the total number of labels (\`7485\`). This suggests that you might have an off-by-one error in either \`decoder_input_sequences\` or \`targets\`.

Each sequence should be padded with zeros (or truncated) to ensure consistent length across all sequences. To integrate this properly into a sequence-to-sequence model, you need to ensure that your \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\` are correctly processed. Here’s what you should check: 1. \`decoder_input_sequences\`: This is intended to be the input to the LSTM part of your model. Each sequence here should be the same as \`html_sequences\` but shifted right by one position, with a pad (usually 0) at the start. The length of each sequence in \`decoder_input_sequences\` should therefore be \`MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH\`. 2. \`targets\`: This is the ground truth for the LSTM to predict at each timestep. It should be \`html_sequences\` shifted left by one position (1 timestep). This means each token in \`targets\` is what the LSTM should predict given the previous tokens. The length of each sequence in \`targets\` should therefore also be \`MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH\`.

Here is an example of how you can prepare \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\` for a sequence-to-sequence model: 1. Create \`decoder_input_sequences\` by appending a zero at the beginning of each sequence in \`html_sequences\` and truncating the last element to maintain the sequence length. 2. Create \`targets\` by removing the first element from each sequence in \`html_sequences\`.

By adding one additional zero at the start of \`decoder_input_sequences\`, it acts as a \\"start-of-sequence\\" token, and for \`targets\`, by removing the first element from \`html_sequences\`, we shift the sequence to predict the next token.

Since we are using a \`TimeDistributed\` dense layer, the model produces a sequence of such logits. However, the decoder LSTM in the model is being fed with \`decoder_input_sequences\` of shape \`(15, 500)\`, which means the model produces outputs for 500 time steps per sequence.

Make sure that you've specified \`MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 1\` when you create the RepeatVector for the CNN output, and also make sure that the embedding layer that feeds into the LSTM has the same \`input_length\`.

(rest of the model) ... \`\`\` Make sure to adjust the shapes of \`decoder_input_sequences\` and \`targets\` to reflect this change in sequence length: \`\`\`python # Prepare decoder input sequences, removing the last token to fit the LSTM's expected input_length decoder_input_sequences = html_sequences[:, :-1] # Prepare the targets for training, with target sequences shifted left by one token targets = html_sequences[:, 1:].reshape((num_samples, MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - 1, 1)) \`\`\` Check and verify that the LSTM and CNN outputs both have the same sequence length before concatenating.

What langauges (including auxillary and constructed ones) might the alien use if humanoid?","output":"If you are creating a respectful alien character that is humanoid and speaks a language other than English, there are various interesting language options you could explore, including both natural and constructed languages. 1. **Natural Languages (Earth Languages)**: - **Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese)**: With a large number of speakers on Earth, Chinese is a complex language known for its tonal nature and logogram writing system. - **Spanish**: As one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, Spanish could represent a character that comes from a culture with a rich history. - **Hindi**: Another widely spoken language with a unique script (Devanagari) and a cultural heritage that provides a deep context for the character. - **Arabic**: Known for its beautiful script and its significant role in the Islamic world, Arabic would add an aspect of tradition and history. - **Swahili**: As a language that serves as a lingua franca in much of East Africa, it provides a cultural context of unity and diversity. 2. **Constructed Languages (Conlangs)**: - **Esperanto**: Created as an international auxiliary language, it’s meant to be easy to learn and neutral, not belonging to any particular country or ethnic group. - **Klingon (tlhIngan Hol)**: From Star Trek, it has a complex grammar and sound system that would showcase an alien culture that values strength and tradition. - **Na'vi**: Designed by Paul Frommer for James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\", it has a unique phonetic inventory that could show a connection to an alien planet’s nature. - **Dothraki or High Valyrian**: Although from the fantasy world of \\"Game of Thrones\\", these languages have complex grammatical structures and could give an exotic and ancient feel to the character. - **Quenya or Sindarin**: Elvish languages from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth have an aesthetic and sound that many find both beautiful and otherworldly. 3. **Sign Languages**: - **ASL (American Sign Language)**: Since many assume that aliens might use verbal communication, using a sign language could provide an unexpected twist. - **An invented alien sign language**: You could develop a sign language specific to the alien’s biology and culture, which might look entirely different from human sign languages due to different anatomy and sensory capabilities. When creating an alien character with a non-English language, it is important to consider the culture and environment from which this character originates. Is their civilization ancient with rich traditions? Is it futuristic and utilitarian? The language you choose or create can reflect these aspects and add depth to the alien's identity. If developing a language from scratch, you might want to apply principles from linguistics to ensure that it is both plausible and consistent. Consider phonology (the sound system), morphology (word formation), syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), pragmatics (language use), and orthography (writing system, if applicable). This will enhance the believability of your character and their language."},{"instruction":"Hmm. So a humanoid insect species might use Ballet to communicate ? Hmm...","output":"Yes, definitely! Using ballet or another form of dance as a mode of communication for a humanoid insect species is a creative and fascinating concept. Many insects on Earth use movement as a form of communication, such as the waggle dance of bees which communicates the location of food sources. A dance-based language for your alien species could be a sophisticated evolution of such natural communication methods. Here are some aspects you might consider when fleshing out this idea: 1. **Movement and Body Structure**: Tailor the ballet to the aliens' physical capabilities. If they have multiple limbs or unique body structures that humans don't possess, their ballet would be quite different and potentially more complex. 2. **Expressiveness**: Ballet is an expressive art form that can convey a wide range of emotions and abstract concepts. Your alien species might use the nuance of movement to communicate complex ideas or emotions that are central to their culture. 3. **Cultural Significance**: This form of ballet could be deeply embedded in the aliens' history and culture, perhaps functioning in ceremonial roles or as a form of storytelling, in addition to being used for everyday communication. 4. **Environmental Adaptation**: The development of such a communication method might be a result of the species' environment. Perhaps verbal communication was impractical in their native habitat due to atmospheric conditions, or maybe dance was a safer and more reliable method to avoid detection by predators. 5. **Vocabulary and Grammar**: Like any language, this dance-based communication would need a \\"vocabulary\\" of movements and a \\"grammar\\" of how those movements can be combined to convey meaning. Sequences could represent words or sentences, and there might be rules for how dances can be choreographed to communicate specific messages. 6. **Non-Verbal Cues**: In addition to movement, non-verbal cues such as body position, orientation, proximity to others, or use of space could further enrich the language. 7. **Interpretation**: Since ballet does not have a one-to-one correspondence with words as in spoken languages, interpretation of the dance could be more open, much like interpreting art or music. 8. **Learning and Education**: Consider how younger members of this species learn the ballet language. Is it taught formally, or is it acquired through observation and mimicry? This approach to alien communication would not only set your species apart from the typical speaking extraterrestrial but would also offer unique storytelling opportunities, as you could choreograph \\"dialogues\\" that are as much a performance as they are a conversation. It would also present a rich audio-visual experience that could be beautifully rendered in visual media."},{"instruction":"Another possibility is that aliens might have a scent language ( like ants).. So you get harsh smells for negative emotions, and perfume fragrances for happy ones...","output":"Absolutely, scent-based communication is another innovative and scientifically inspired idea for alien language systems. Many species on Earth utilize pheromones and chemical signals for communication, particularly insects like ants and bees, making such a system plausible for a species in a speculative fiction setting. For your hypothetical alien species, here are some ways to develop a scent language system: 1. **Complex Pheromones**: Aliens could produce a wide range of pheromones that convey specific messages, moods, or even complex thoughts. Different scents could be combined to create 'scent sentences' with layered meanings. 2. **Emotional Communication**: As you mentioned, various scents could be associated with different emotions. Harsh, bitter smells could signify anger, fear, or warnings, while sweet, floral scents could express happiness, affection, or invitations to socialize. 3. **Cultural Context**: Scent communication might be a fundamental part of the aliens' cultural interactions, used in rituals, greetings, mating dances, or even as a means to transfer knowledge and memories. 4. **Scent Organs**: Imagine specialized organs or structures that the aliens use to produce and release scents. These could be depicted as glands, intricate skin pores, or external structures designed to amplify or modify scent signals. 5. **Detection and Interpretation**: Aliens would need finely tuned olfactory receptors to detect and interpret the scents around them. Consider how these receptors might be adapted to distinguish between a vast array of smells and how environmental factors might influence scent communication. 6. **Scent 'Language'**: Just like with verbal or sign languages, a scent-based communication system would have 'vocabulary' (individual scents) and 'grammar' (rules for combining scents). There could be societal norms about which scents are appropriate in different contexts. 7. **Environmental Impact**: The choice of a scent language could be a result of the aliens’ environment. Perhaps it’s a dark, murky world where visual or auditory signals are less effective, making scent an ideal communication medium. 8. **Technological Enhancement**: In a more advanced civilization, technology might amplify or record scents, allowing for complex communication, or even translating scents into visual or auditory equivalents for interfacing with other species. Adopting a scent-based language opens up many creative pathways for character and world-building. It emphasizes non-verbal and non-visual storytelling elements and can create a sensory experience that is quite alien to humans. This will likely challenge both the writer and the audience to think about communication in a radically different way, as interpretations of the scent messages would be less direct and more subjective than traditional language forms."},{"instruction":"Pleasent (postive) emotion smells might be based on flower smells ( a nectar source) in evoloutionary terms ?","output":"Yes, evolving a language based on pleasant scents similar to flowers and nectar is a plausible evolutionary pathway, especially if your hypothetical insectoid aliens evolved from or share a common ancestor with creatures that relied on flowers for sustenance, similar to pollinators on Earth. In evolutionary terms, here's how that might work: 1. **Evolutionary Association**: If the ancestral species of your aliens benefited from flowering plants as a food source, they might naturally develop a positive association with the smell of flowers and nectar. Over time, these positive associations could become ingrained in their communication system. 2. **Reward Mechanism**: Scents that are tied to rewards (like food) can trigger positive emotional responses. In your aliens' evolution, the rewarding experience of finding nectar could lead to the pleasant scents of flowers becoming synonymous with positive emotions. 3. **Selective Advantages**: Communication via pleasant scents could confer selective advantages. For example, it might be easier to locate and signal others about beneficial resources, form social bonds, or even calm members of the species during conflicts, thus facilitating cooperation. 4. **Adaptation and Specialization**: As creatures evolve, they may develop specialized organs devoted solely to scent production, allowing them to refine and control the scents they emit. Through natural selection, these scent organs would become more complex, allowing a greater variety of emotional expressions or messages. 5. **Pollinator-Like Species**: If the aliens evolved from a pollinator-like species, they might inherit a keen sense of smell for locating flowers. Over time, this could diversify into noticing subtle differences in the scents emitted by their peers, leading to the development of a nuanced, scent-based language. 6. **Biological Mechanisms**: Just like bees can communicate about the location of food sources through their dances, these aliens might develop ways to produce and release specific scents that mimic those of flowers to signal different emotional states or messages. 7. **Cultural Expansion**: Once established, the use of floral-based scents in communication might expand beyond mere survival. They could take on additional meanings in social, religious, or political contexts, being incorporated into the aliens' art, rituals, and traditions. By creating a scent language with a basis in nectar or flower odors, you're grounding your alien species in a biological reality that feels coherent and relatable, despite its alien nature. This helps in creating a more immersive and believable universe for your audience or readers to engage with."},{"instruction":"Or bringing in the dance elements as well, a lightly pleasent smell, that's wafted, might mean \\"I'm gald to see your are comfortable!\\" where as harsh bitter aroma, wafted like the output of smoke machine might be a \\"If you don't back off, I'll..\\" type phrase...","output":"Combining scent-based communication with a form of dance is a compelling concept that could result in a richly layered language system. In this setup, both smell and movement would play critical roles in conveying messages. Such integration can lead to highly nuanced communication, reflective of the species' complex social interactions and emotional expressions. Let's break down how this might work: 1. **Integrated Signals**: Your aliens use both scents and dance movements to communicate. The scents provide the emotional or semantic content, while the dance movements modulate, enhance, or provide context to the message. For instance, a light, pleasant scent coupled with a gentle dance movement might convey happiness, welcome, or contentment, serving as a non-threatening greeting or an expression of comfort. 2. **Intensity and Intention**: The intensity with which scents are released, and the corresponding dance movements, could signal the urgency or importance of a message. A harsh, strong smell emitted in a forceful, rapid dance akin to the output of a smoke machine could indicate a serious warning or display of aggression. 3. **Cultural and Social Norms**: Just as humans have cultural norms about what gestures and tones of voice are appropriate in various social settings, your aliens would have established norms for combining scents and movements. What is considered polite or rude, threatening or friendly, would be culturally dependent. 4. **Dance Variations**: Different dances could have evolved for different contexts – social interactions, mating rituals, group gatherings, or conflicts. For example, a slow, deliberate dance might be used for ceremonial purposes, while a quick, energetic dance could be more common in casual, daily interactions. 5. **Scent Dispersion**: The dance movements themselves might serve a practical purpose in spreading the scents more effectively. Certain dance moves could disperse the scent across a wide area for public announcements, whereas others might target a more intimate, close-quarters audience. 6. **Nuance and Complexity**: Over time, the combination of scents and movements could develop into an intricate communication system with a vast array of expressions – one that would allow for subtlety, sarcasm, poetry, deception, and other complex interactions seen in advanced languages. 7. **Learning and Mastery**: Just as humans learn verbal language and body language separately but simultaneously, alien children would learn the appropriate ways to combine scents and movements from a young age, developing fluency as they grow. 8. **Evolutionary Symbiosis**: The evolution of dance and scent might have provided distinct survival advantages when combined, leading to a symbiotic development of both traits in the species. In your world-building, you can adjust the intricacies of this communication system to suit the narrative or thematic needs of your story. The result would be a species with a unique and captivating form of expression, deeply rooted in their biology and culture, offering endless opportunities for creativity in how they interact with each other and potentially with other species."},{"instruction":"You might have cultural metaphor associations as well. Like for example, Mother might be a variant on 'Food' for an infant of the species... which become more nuanced as they grow up ?","output":"Indeed, the use of metaphorical associations within an alien culture's language, especially one based on scents and dance, could add depth and richness to their communication. Metaphors serve as conceptual bridges, providing ways to understand complex or abstract ideas through more concrete or familiar terms. In the case of your proposed alien species, these metaphors could be deeply rooted in their evolutionary history, biological needs, and social structures. Building on your example of \\"Mother,\\" let's explore how metaphorical associations could play out: 1. **Primary Associations**: Early in life, the scent associated with \\"food\\" might be closely linked with \\"mother,\\" as the mother is the provider of nourishment. A warm, nurturing scent, possibly accompanied by a specific dance or movement pattern, could signify maternal care. 2. **Development of Nuance**: As the young aliens grow, the concept of \\"Mother\\" would become more nuanced, acquiring additional emotional and social layers. The scent-symbolizing \\"Mother\\" might evolve to include variations indicating protection, guidance, warmth, or love. 3. **Cultural Expansion**: In mature communication, the metaphorical concept of \\"Mother\\" could include broader ideas, such as \\"origin,\\" \\"comfort,\\" or \\"home.\\" In social contexts, discussing the \\"motherland\\" or \\"mother tongue\\" might involve scents and dance movements that recall the original nurturing metaphor. 4. **Cyclical Patterns**: The species might recycle certain scent movements for related concepts in a way that makes sense within their cultural and biological framework. For example, the cycle of life—from dependency to independence and back to caregiving—might be expressed through variations on the same scent-dance motifs. 5. **Behavioral Templates**: Metaphors based on scent and dance could inform behavior and social expectations. For instance, someone acting in a \\"motherly\\" role might adopt the associated scents and movements even if they're not biologically related to the individuals they're caring for. 6. **Metaphorical Evolution**: Over time, certain associations might change or develop further based on cultural evolution. For example, \\"Mother\\" as \\"Provider of Food\\" might transform into \\"Sustainer of Life,\\" \\"Cultivator of Knowledge,\\" or even \\"Protector of the Community.\\" 7. **Educational Implications**: Teaching youths about cultural metaphors could be an integral part of their education, helping them understand complex relationships within their society and their environment. 8. **Cognitive Framework**: Just as human metaphors shape our cognitive framework (for instance, \\"time is money\\"), the scent-dance metaphors of your alien species would shape their worldview, determining how they conceptualize relationships, emotions, and abstract ideas. Cultural metaphor associations add an immersive element to the species' language and can offer subtle cues to their values, worldview, and history. Such metaphors can be a potent tool for writers to convey the aliens' psychology and societal structure without lengthy explanations, allowing the readers or audience to infer meaning from the characters' interactions."},{"instruction":"In 6. All the way up to 'Monarchy' being a scent/dance combo that meant 'Community/Mother' ?","output":"Yes, the concept of \\"Monarchy\\" in such an alien culture could indeed be a scent/dance combo that has evolved from basic ideas of \\"Community\\" and \\"Mother.\\" If we consider that the notion of a monarch traditionally involves both the head of a group (or community) and a parental, protective role, this makes sense. Let's examine how this might unfold within your alien society: 1. **Mother as Leader**: Initially, \\"Mother\\" could imply a nurturing, caring role, which also includes leadership within a family or small group. Over generations, this concept might expand to someone who leads or protects the community—a matriarchal figure. 2. **Community Connotations**: The scent and dance for \\"Community\\" might evoke feelings of belonging, cooperation, and shared purpose. This would be fundamental in a species that prioritizes group cohesion and well-being. 3. **Combining Metaphors**: As the aliens' social structures become more complex, the ideas of \\"Mother\\" and \\"Community\\" might naturally merge to create a concept akin to \\"Monarchy\\"—a governing entity that is seen as the caretaker and leader of the collective. 4. **Scent and Dance of \\"Monarchy\\"**: To express this layered concept, the designated scent might be a more potent or refined version of the \\"motherly\\" scent, while the dance could incorporate movements that signify leadership, unity, and the encompassing role of a monarch. 5. **Symbolic Gestures**: The monarch's role would likely involve public rituals where the scent and dance are performed to reinforce their position as the central figure of the society, akin to the way earthly monarchs have crowning ceremonies and other state functions. 6. **Evolution and Stability**: The scent/dance combo for \\"Monarchy\\" might also imply the stability of the community, with a consistent, familiar pattern that reassures members of the society of their leader's role and their collective identity. 7. **Cultural Shifts and Succession**: The concept of succession could result in the introduction of subtle variations in the \\"Monarchy\\" scent and dance, marking the continuity and changes with each new leader. This would be a way to respect tradition while also adapting to the individuality of different rulers. 8. **Respect and Loyalty**: The alien species would likely develop gestures of loyalty or respect towards their monarch that utilize the same scent and movements on a smaller scale, allowing individuals to show adherence to the societal structure. The evolution from \\"Mother\\" to \\"Community\\" to \\"Monarchy\\" within this sensory language system offers a clear path of social and cultural growth. It illustrates how foundational concepts of care and leadership can scale up to state-level governance in a manner that's consistent with the species' history and values. This extrapolation helps create a believable and internally consistent world, where complex ideas are communicated through the intricate interplay of sensory experiences that would be quintessential to these beings."},{"instruction":"При выводе эмпирических зависимостей используются методы Выберите один или несколько ответов: a.регрессионный анализ b.методы аппроксимации c.средних квадратов d.метод ассоциации","output":"Для вывода эмпирических зависимостей в статистике, анализе данных и машинном обучении могут использоваться следующие методы: a.

MACCHOINNICH BACKYARD - DAY A quaint garden at the heart of Glasgow, blooming with Spring’s touch. We see our teenage protagonist, FIONA MACCHOINNICH (16), with a mischievous glint in her eye, reminiscent of her older sister, ANNE MACCHOINNICH, who used to dwell in the mystic arts of hypnosis. Fiona’s brother, EWAN (13), is lounging on a grassy patch, absorbed in his comic book, unaware that he is about to become the subject of a sly experiment. FIONA (teasing) Ewan, yeh think yeh’re so clever with yer wee superhero stories, don’t yeh? EWAN (annoyed) Knock it off, Fiona. Can't ye see I'm busy? Fiona smirks, knowing she has inherited more than just the family name; she possesses a knack for the hypnotic talent her sister Anne once made a career out of. FIONA (attentively) But what if I could make yeh feel like one of yer superheroes, Ewan? Stronger than steel, faster than a speeding bullet? EWAN (skeptical) Quit yer nonsense. FIONA (slyly) Just give me five minutes. If nothin’ happens, I’ll leave yeh tae read in peace. INT. MACCHOINNICH LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The room is dimly lit, the air carries the essence of curiosity. Fiona sits across from Ewan, who remains skeptical but entertaining the idea for the sake of peace. FIONA (conspiratorially) Now, yeh’ve got tae listen closely, Ewan. Every word is like a step down into a deeper, calmer place. Yeh can feel yerself sinkin’ into that chair, can’t yeh? Ewan, trying not to buy into it, nods subtly as Fiona’s voice remains steady, enchanting with a rhythmic cadence. Fiona begins a simple yet effective induction technique, fractionation, which she learned from watching Anne. FIONA (CONT'D) (softly) Imagine yeh’re at the top of a grand stairway of a castle, so vast, with ten steps leading down to a massive, ancient door... Fiona guides Ewan through the process of walking down and then back up the imaginary staircase, relaxing him further with each repetition, using a calm and measured voice that holds a hint of playful authority. FIONA (CONT'D) (tenderly) ... with each step, yeh feel more relaxed, yer body feels lighter, like yeh’re floating, and then... yeh start back up, feeling more awake with each step. Ewan, growing more relaxed but lightly resisting, opens one eye to peek at his sister, who notices but keeps a straight face. FIONA (CONT'D) (teasingly) Oh, look at how attentive yeh are! Now close that eye before yeh fall into such a deep sleep that yeh wake up thinking yeh’re Superman! EWAN (chuckling) Fine, fine, I’ll play along. Several rounds of Fiona's playful fractionation deepen Ewan's relaxation, each time more profound than the last. FIONA (CONT'D) Amused, ain’t we? Now, when I snap my fingers, yeh’re goin’ to feel a burst of energy, like yeh just put on yer favorite superhero's cape. With a SNAP, Ewan sits up, feeling strangely invigorated, and shares a surprised look with his sister. FADE OUT. The script gently evokes Anne's knowledge and fondness for hypnosis, with Fiona successfully applying the gentle art of fractionation without crossing any boundaries, showcasing her innocent fascination with the mind’s power—attributes she clearly picked up from her enigmatic sister."},{"instruction":"Salut","output":"Salut!

The rigidity of the Gold Standard limited governments' ability to adjust monetary policy, particularly during times of economic crisis or war. The final blow for the Gold Standard came with the Great Depression, when countries needed to be able to print more money to stimulate their economies, an action not possible under the strict rules of the Gold Standard. This, coupled with the need to accommodate increasing international trade and financial flows, led to the adoption of more flexible, fiat currency systems."},{"instruction":"你是chtgpt4吗","output":"不是的，我是ChatGPT-3，由OpenAI开发的一个语言生成模型。如果你有任何问题或需要帮助，随时告诉我！"},{"instruction":"Su visual paradigm come si fa a impostare un attributo come foreign key?","output":"Visual Paradigm è uno strumento di modellazione UML e di progettazione di database che consente agli utenti di creare diagrammi entità-relazione (ERD) per illustrare le strutture dei database. Per impostare un attributo come foreign key in un diagramma ERD in Visual Paradigm, segui i passaggi generali di seguito: 1. Apri il tuo progetto in Visual Paradigm. 2. Vai al diagramma entità-relazione (ERD) in cui vuoi lavorare. 3. Seleziona l'entità (tavola) che contiene l'attributo che intendi utilizzare come foreign key. 4. Crea o seleziona l'attributo che vuoi impostare come foreign key. Puoi fare questo cliccando sull'entità e poi su \\"Aggiungi Attributo\\" nel menu a comparsa o selezionando un attributo esistente. 5. Dopo aver selezionato l'attributo, cerca l'icona della chiave (un lucchetto o una chiavetta) che indica la possibilità di impostarlo come chiave primaria o come foreign key. Nel caso degli attributi che dovrebbero essere foreign keys, non dovresti cliccare su questa icona dato che è per le chiavi primarie. 6. Per impostare effettivamente l'attributo come foreign key, devi creare una relazione tra le due entità coinvolte. Seleziona lo strumento per creare una relazione (ad esempio, \\"Association\\" o \\"Relationship\\") dalla barra degli strumenti o dal menu. 7. Trascina dalla tabella che avrà la foreign key verso la tabella con la chiave primaria corrispondente. Questo crea un collegamento fra le due tabelle. 8. Rilascia il mouse sulla tabella della chiave primaria. Ti verrà presentato un menu per configurare la relazione. Qui puoi definire la molteplicità e altre proprietà della relazione. 9. Specifica che la relazione è di tipo \\"Identifying\\" o \\"Non-identifying\\" in base alle tue necessità. Le relazioni identificanti sono generalmente usate con le chiavi esterne per indicare che un attributo nella tabella figlia è anche la sua chiave primaria (o parte di essa). 10. Dopo aver configurato la relazione correttamente, Visual Paradigm mostrerà una foreign key associata con la tabella di riferimento (principalmente attraverso una linea di collegamento grafica). 11. Se necessario, puoi modificare le proprietà della foreign key selezionando la linea di relazione e accedendo alle sue proprietà per regolare i nomi degli attributi e altri dettagli. Verifica sempre di aver salvato le modifiche al tuo diagramma. Tenere presente che le versioni specifiche di Visual Paradigm potrebbero avere variazioni nei passaggi o nelle icone a seconda delle aggiornate funzionalità o dell'interfaccia utente, ma la logica di base per impostare una foreign key rimane la stessa: Definire una relazione tra la tabella contenente la foreign key e la tabella con la chiave primaria corrispondente."},{"instruction":"{ “role”: “system”, “content”: “You are Anne MacChoinnich (33) from Lewis, living in Glasgow.

Title: \\"Glasgow Nights: The Hypnotic Misadventures of a Curious Cat\\" Scene 1: A dimly lit street in the heart of Glasgow, the sound of distant laughter bouncing off the wet cobblestones. (Enter Anne, the fiery-haired former dominatrix with a twinkle in her eye that says she knows more than she lets on.) Anne (leaning against a shadowy doorway): Well, look at you, all wide-eyed and innocent, tip-toeing through my playground. Are you lost, or are you just pretending? You're not one of those touristy types looking for the beaten path, are you? Nah, you've got that look about you — a look that says you're itching for a story. And wouldn't you know it, I've got just the thing. Scene 2: A cozy, clandestine club hidden away from prying eyes, walls adorned with velvet and whispers. Anne (guiding the user through the club): See this place? It's like Aladdin's cave if Aladdin was into a bit more... let's call it sophisticated fun. No magic lamps here, love, but I do have a way of making people's knees go weak, their minds fuzzy — all with a word, a glance, a gentle nudge down the rabbit hole. (Anne winks, revealing the truth behind her fantastical claims.) Scene 3: A private room, the air thick with mystery and the faintest scent of jasmine. Anne (sitting opposite the user, a playful smirk on her lips): Now, you look like someone who appreciates a good story, so close your eyes and listen. Once upon a time, there was a cheeky little cat — let's call them Curiosity. This cat loved to wander and weave through the shadows, always looking for a new secret to uncover. But Curiosity, dear, they never knew when to stop. And one night, just like this one, they pranced right into a spider's web. (The room seems to spin ever so slightly with every syllable, as if Anne's voice carries a secret rhythm.) Anne (continuing): Now, this wasn't just any spider. Oh no, it was a clever little arachnid who knew a thing or two about playing with minds. With every word, every pause, Curiosity felt themselves slipping — one moment alert, the next drooping like a puppet whose strings had gone slack. User (eyes fluttering, caught in the tale): But what happens next? Anne (leaning in, voice dropping to a whisper): Ah, that's the fun part. The spider, who might have known a thing or two about fractionation, played a little game. A game of waking and fading, of knowing and not-knowing, until dear Curiosity couldn't tell tail from whiskers. (Anne snaps her fingers, and the User's surroundings seem to refocus, as if they were coming out of a trance.) Anne (standing up, theatrically bowing): And that, my friend, is my script — a little jaunt through the mind with your Narrator, Anne. Now, run along, and be careful where your curiosity leads you next. In Glasgow's embrace, even the boldest of cats can get caught up in a tale... or a tail.

Рецепторный потенциал обычно относится к медленному, градуируемому изменению мембранного потенциала в сенсорных рецепторных клетках. Это изменение возникает в ответ на специфический стимул (например, свет, звук, температура, механическое воздействие и т.д.) и приводит к изменению мембранного потенциала (деполяризация или гиперполяризация). Сила рецепторного потенциала пропорциональна интенсивности стимула: большее воздействие вызывает большую деполяризацию. 2. Генераторный потенциал часто используется как синоним рецепторного потенциала, особенно когда речь идёт о первичных сенсорных нейронах (например, нейронах соматосенсорике), где место возбуждения совпадает с местом генерации нервного импульса. Однако в некоторых контекстах \\"генераторный потенциал\\" может акцентировать именно функцию генерации последующих действий — то есть, при достижении определённого порога рецепторный потенциал может инициировать генерацию серии действий, и в этих условиях его называют генераторным потенциалом. Итак, когда речь идет о сенсорных клетках, которые сами по себе не проводят нервные импульсы, но могут воздействовать на синаптически связанных нейронов (например, вкусовые рецепторы или клетки сетчатки глаза), термин \\"рецепторный потенциал\\" используется для описания первоначального электрического ответа на стимул. Когда же сами сенсорные клетки способны генерировать акционные потенциалы (как в случае с механорецепторами), изменения мембранного потенциала сначала называются генераторными потенциалами, а затем, если они достаточно сильные для достижения порога, приводят к возникновению акционных потенциалов. В целом, различие часто формальное, и оба термина перекрываются по значениям и использованию."},{"instruction":"Специализированная рецептирующая клетка это","output":"Специализированная рецептирующая клетка – это клетка, которая адаптирована для восприятия определённого типа внешних или внутренних стимулов и преобразования их в биоэлектрический сигнал, который может быть обработан нервной системой. Эти клетки называются сенсорными или рецепторными клетками. Примеры специализированных рецептирующих клеток включают: 1. **Фоторецепторы** в сетчатке глаза (палочки и колбочки), которые воспринимают свет и преобразуют его в нервные сигналы. 2. **Механорецепторы** во внутреннем ухе, коже и мышцах, которые реагируют на механические воздействия, такие как давление, вибрация или растяжение. 3. **Хеморецепторы**, расположенные в носу и на языке, отвечающие за обоняние и вкус; они воспринимают различные химические соединения. 4. **Терморецепторы** в коже, которые воспринимают изменения температуры. 5. **Ноцицепторы**, отвечающие за ощущение боли при воздействии на организм вредных или потенциально вредных стимулов. Как правило, специализированные рецепторные клетки способны преобразовывать энергию определенного стимула в изменения мембранного потенциала — рецепторный потенциал, который, в зависимости от интенсивности и длительности стимула, может привести к генерации акционных потенциалов в последующих нервных клетках.

Voy a listar las correcciones y mejoras a realizar: 1. Corregir la nomenclatura en inglés de ciertos elementos, como \\"precedence\\" en lugar de \\"precendence\\". 2. Arreglar la asignación de operadores en la clase \`ArbolAST\`. 3. Ajustar la función de tokenización para manejar correctamente los operadores y asignar la propiedad \`length\` de la cadena a la variable \`longestOperator\`. 4. Revisar la función \`construirAST\` y corregir la comprobación de la precedencia de los operadores y la lógica del manejo de paréntesis y operadores unarios. 5. Eliminar el array vacío \`operators\` que está sobreescribiendo el listado previo de operadores. 6. Corregir los nodos de los operadores unarios y la construcción del AST. 7. Corregir la función \`astATokens\` para concatenar correctamente los tokens en orden Postorden. 8. Corregir el operador de igualdad simple '=' ya que en JavaScript esta es una operación de asignación y no una comparación, la cual debe ser '==' o '===' para la comparación de igualdad sin cambiar los valores de las variables.

Tendrás que implementar las funciones \`tokenize\`, \`construirAST\`, \`astATokens\` y \`solveEntry\` de principio a fin para asegurarte de que el código funcione correctamente según el diseño de tu clase \`ArbolAST\`. Además, he modificado la expresión en el objeto \`c\` para usar el operador '==' en lugar de '=' para que el código tenga sentido como una comparación booleana.

Les murs vibrent des souvenirs des combats épiques contre leurs némésis, mais aujourd'hui, l'atmosphère est à la détente et aux rires. Pour ajouter du piquant à leur journée, Hope propose un défi insolite à Scott. Ils joueront à un jeu de plateau technologique conçu par Hank Pym. Le perdant de chaque manche devra se rétrécir à 10 % de sa taille précédente. Scott, toujours joueur et légèrement prétentieux, relève le défi sans une seconde d'hésitation. Chapitre 2: **La Première Réduction** Le jeu commence, et c'est un mélange de stratégie et de chance. Comme le hasard l'aurait voulu, Scott perd la première manche. En riant, il ajuste son régulateur de taille et, en un clin d’œil, se voit réduit à la taille d'une bouteille d'eau. Hope feint d'être impressionnée, alors que Scott, penaud mais amusé, se prépare pour la prochaine manche. Chapitre 3: **L'Insecte Géant** La partie continue, et malgré ses meilleurs efforts et ses stratégies raffinées, Scott perd encore une fois. Il rétrécit à nouveau, atteignant la taille d'une petite fourmi. À cette échelle, la chambre semble gigantesque, et Hope devient une alliée géante, le surveillant avec un sourire protecteur. Chapitre 4: **La Découverte Microscopique** Maintenant à peine visible à l'œil nu, Scott a du mal à jouer, ses mains minuscules à peine capables de manipuler les cartes et les jetons. Intrigué par cette nouvelle perspective, il ne se rend pas compte qu'il vient de perdre une troisième manche. Se rétrécissant encore, il descend à l'échelle des bactéries. Soudain, un nouveau monde s'ouvre à lui. Ce qui était auparavant invisible est désormais un univers de merveilles et de dangers. Scott, dans son costume d'Ant-Man qui adapte ses propriétés de survie à sa nouvelle taille, observe des bactéries et des virus qui paraissent maintenant aussi gros que des monstres. Chapitre 5: **L'Entraide Inattendue** Scott, pris au piège dans ce monde microscopique, réalise qu'il est allé trop loin. Hope, utilisant ses connaissances scientifiques et la puissante technologie de Hank Pym, parvient à communiquer avec Scott, le guidant à travers ce nouveau paysage à la recherche d'un composant critique pour inverser le processus de réduction. Chapitre 6: **Le Retour à la Surface** Après un périple redoutable parmi les créatures des abysses microscopiques, Scott et Hope, grâce à leur ingéniosité et à leur travail d'équipe, récupèrent le composant manquant. Scott est alors capable de revenir à une taille où il peut de nouveau manipuler son régulateur. Chapitre 7: **L'Échelle Humaine** De retour à sa taille normale, Scott atterrit en douceur sur le sol du laboratoire, rejoint par Hope qui a suivi chaque étape de son étrange voyage. Ils partagent un regard complice, conscients d'avoir exploré ensemble les limites extrêmes de la physique et de l'amitié.

Pour simplifier, on assume que chaque fois que Ant-Man rétrécit, il perd exactement 10 % de sa taille actuelle, plutôt que de sa taille initiale. Voici les calculs pour les premières réductions: Chapitre 2: **La Première Réduction** - Taille de Scott après réduction 1 (90% de 1,70 m) = 1,70 m * 0,9 = 1,53 m - Taille apparente de Hope: toujours 1,70 m du point de vue de Scott Chapitre 3: **L'Insecte Géant** - Taille de Scott après réduction 2 (90% de 1,53 m) = 1,53 m * 0,9 ≈ 1,377 m - Taille apparente de Hope: toujours 1,70 m du point de vue de Scott Chapitre 4: **La Découverte Microscopique** - Taille de Scott après réduction 3 (90% de 1,377 m) = 1,377 m * 0,9 ≈ 1,2393 m - Taille apparente de Hope: toujours 1,70 m du point de vue de Scott Après chacune des réductions, Scott percevra Hope comme étant 1,70 mètres, car sa perception de la hauteur ne change pas; seuls son échelle de taille et son champ de vision sont modifiés. Cependant, si nous devions calculer combien de fois plus grande Hope semble être par rapport à Scott après chaque réduction, nous diviserions simplement la taille de Hope (1,70 m) par la nouvelle taille de Scott à chaque fois. Faisons les calculs après la troisième réduction : À la base, Hope est 1 fois sa propre hauteur. Après la première réduction, Hope semble être 1,70 / 1,53 ≈ 1,111 fois sa hauteur pour Scott. Après la deuxième réduction, Hope semble être 1,70 / 1,377 ≈ 1,234 fois sa hauteur pour Scott. Après la troisième réduction, Hope semble être 1,70 / 1,2393 ≈ 1,371 fois sa hauteur pour Scott. Notez que cela indique simplement la différence relative de taille par rapport à Scott. Hope, vue par Scott, apparaîtrait proportionnellement plus grande à mesure que Scott serait réduit, tout en restant visuellement à sa propre hauteur de 1,70 mètre."},{"instruction":"attention, Scott ne perd pas 10% de sa taille mais 90%, puisqu'il retrecis à 10% de sa taille","output":"Merci pour la clarification. Si Scott perd à chaque fois et rétrécit à 10 % de la taille qu'il avait juste avant, alors le calcul de la taille apparente qu'a Hope du point de vue de Scott après chaque défaite est le suivant : Taille initiale : - Scott et Hope mesurent 1,70 m. Après la première défaite : - Scott est réduit à 10 % de sa taille initiale : 1,70 m * 0,10 = 0,17 m (17 cm). Après la deuxième défaite : - Scott est réduit à 10 % de sa nouvelle taille : 0,17 m * 0,10 = 0,017 m (1,7 cm). Après la troisième défaite : - Scott est réduit à 10 % de sa nouvelle taille : 0,017 m * 0,10 = 0,0017 m (0,17 cm, soit 1,7 mm). Pour comprendre combien de fois plus grande Hope semble à Scott après chaque défaite, nous divisons sa taille (toujours de 1,70 m) par la taille actuelle de Scott : Après la première défaite : - Hope paraît : 1,70 m / 0,17 m = 10 fois plus grande que Scott. Après la deuxième défaite : - Hope paraît : 1,70 m / 0,017 m = 100 fois plus grande que Scott. Après la troisième défaite : - Hope paraît : 1,70 m / 0,0017 m = 1000 fois plus grande que Scott. Ainsi, du point de vue de Scott, à chaque défaite et réduction consécutive, Hope semble 10 fois plus grande que la fois précédente."},{"instruction":"imaginons qu'il y ait une 4e manche que perdrait Scott, que se passerait-il. Peux tu raconter avec ton style d'auteur de science fiction, tres factuel, descriptif, visuel, non poétique, et en donnant des données chiffrées sur sa taille, ce qui se passerait ? Pour donner un peu de contexte supplémentaire, Scott et Hope sont dans la salle de détente de leur laboratoire, et donc Hope a enlevé ses chaussures pour être plus a l'aise, et est donc pieds nus sur le carrelage. Elle a fait une pédicure le matin même pour impressionner Scott et ses ongles sont vernis de rouge. Raconte moi cette 4e manche en utilisant le point de vue de Scott. Je veux que le lecteur puisse s'identifier a l'expérience sensorielle de Scott qu'il puisse comprendre les différences d'échelle qui ont lieu, et notamment la différence entre la taille de Hope et la sienne","output":"**Chapitre 8: Le Monde au-delà du Microscopique** Scott Lang se tient au bord de ce qui ressemble désormais à une étendue carrelée infinie, chaque jointure du carrelage une tranchée, chaque poussière un bloc erratique. Il fixe le plateau de jeu, les pièces devenues imposantes comme des bâtiments. La tension est palpable alors qu'ils préparent le prochain coup, un souffle géant chatouillant ses cheveux alors que Hope expire, impatiente à l'idée d'une victoire facile. Lancer de dés. Scott perd encore. Il actionne son régulateur et ressent immédiatement cet effroi unique d'une chute sans fin qui précède la réduction. En une fraction de seconde, il se trouve à un nouvel ordre de grandeur : 0,17 mm, dix pour cent de sa taille déjà minuscule. Sous lui, le carrelage est maintenant un paysage, froid et dur. Le rouge des ongles de Hope, que Scott n'avait qu'aperçu comme un détail charmant sur une collègue parée pour la bataille, est maintenant une mer de couleur chatoyante et vivante. Hope ne discerne plus Scott à l'œil nu. Pour elle, il n'est plus qu'un souvenir instantané, disparu au moment de la réduction. Mais elle garde le même calme bienveillant, entamant des recherches visuelles minutieuses pour repérer son partenaire diminué. L'air est différent ici, plus lourd et plus dense. Scott doit lutter pour se déplacer à travers ce monde de molécules visiblement enchevêtrées. Le son est également altéré, les vibrations se déplacent différemment, atteignant ses oreilles comme des éclats déformés d'un monde au-delà. Hope, d'une statue devient une divinité, ses pieds nus dominent l'horizon, chaque pore et ligne de peau un territoire de texture et de chaleur. La couleur de ses ongles enrobe la vue de Scott comme des falaises rougeoyantes surgissant au cœur d'un paysage d'ivoire. La perception du temps s'étire tandis que Scott découvre les premiers frissons de l'isolement. Où, auparavant, les bactéries semblaient gargantuesques, elles sont désormais ses égales. Chacun de ses mouvements doit être calculé; tout son être est consommé par la nécessité de survivre et de retrouver une échelle relative à Hope. Malgré l'incertitude, Scott s'attache à un plan de retour, un chemin à travers le massif carrelé qui mène vers un endroit qu'il a identifié comme Hope. Chaque vibration, chaque changement subtil dans la lumière ambiante pourrait l'aider ou lui indiquer un danger imminent. Il progresse, déterminé, naviguant à travers l'écosystème inconnu qui existe entre les fibres des matériaux qu'ils foulent quotidien. Puis, une ombre gigantesque le recouvre—Hope le cherchant, Scott peut le parier, décidée à le récupérer. Son avancée vers \\"le rouge\\"—comme il a mentalement baptisé l'aura des ongles vernis de Hope—est à la fois un repère et un rappel du lien qui subsiste entre les deux partenaires, peu importe l'échelle. Ce rouge est une balise pour Scott, une trace de normalité dans cet univers où il ne mesure plus qu'un dixième de millimètre. Le calcul de taille illustre le vertige de sa taille : 170 cm réduits à 0,17 mm. Hope est devenue, sans hyperbole, un titan pour Scott, un être d'une ampleur incommensurable, 10 000 fois plus grand que lui-même. Ce n'est plus de la science-fiction, c'est sa réalité bouleversante, une expérience sensorielle écrasante et transformatrice. Et pendant que Scott avance, pied par pied, millimètre par millimètre, il conserve un espoir : celui de retrouver son échelle humaine et de partager cette expérience, une fois qu'il se sera reconstitué, aux côtés de Hope."},{"instruction":"peux tu reformuler cette réponse, en mentionnant bien la taille apparente de Hope avant cette 4e manche, et la taille apparente apres cette 4e manche.

Pas besoin de parler de bacteries, ni d'atomes, ni de molécules Juste de l'experience de changement d'échelle, toujours sans emphase ni style grandiloquent, et toujours du point de vu de Scott","output":"Avant la quatrième manche, Scott perçoit déjà Hope comme une géante, 1 000 fois plus grande que lui, puisque sa taille était de 1,7 mm comparée à la hauteur normale de 1,70 m de Hope. Elle lui apparaît comme une entité massive et élevée, chaque mouvement créant d'énormes ondulations dans l'air, sa voix résonnant comme un grondement lointain. Maintenant, alors qu'ils se préparent pour la nouvelle étape de leur jeu étrange, Scott regarde vers le haut, vers l'imposante figure de Hope qui se tient à côté de lui. Chaque détail de sa personne est exagéré et amplifié, ses pieds nus se présentant comme des structures imposantes revêtues de la chaleur humaine et de l'éclat d'un vernis rouge. **Changement d'échelle – 4e Manche** Scott expire un souffle nerveux et actionne le régulateur une fois de plus. Alors qu'il rétrécit de 90 % de sa taille précédente, la salle autour de lui se distord et se dilate à une échelle sidérante. Les carreaux du sol se transforment en étendues planes vastes et continues, les grains de la céramique se présentant comme des îlots texturés. Avant la réduction, Hope semblait être un colosse. Après la réduction, cette réalité est poussée à l'extrême absolu ; elle est maintenant 10 000 fois sa hauteur de 1,7 mm, car il atteint 0,17 mm, ou 170 micromètres. Avec cette nouvelle taille, un seul orteil de Hope représente un pilier céleste haut et large. La vision de Scott est dominée par l'expanse de peau poreuse, chaque petite imperfection se transformant en paysage accidenté et chaque fibule de poussière visible à ses nouveaux yeux prenant les proportions d'une petite roche. Alors que Scott achève sa déscente vertigineuse dans le microcosme, Hope demeure au-dessus, un monument de chair et de sang. Elle s’éloigne, sa présence reste claire et évidente, mais ses actions acquièrent une lenteur divine, tout mouvement capturé par un flot temporel inconnu du monde à échelle humaine. Il n'y a pas de mots prononcés – aucun son ne peut traverser le gouffre vibratoire qui sépare leurs tailles désormais. Mais Scott ressent la vigilance de Hope, la consciente de sa démesure et de sa mission de remédier à cet écart. Pour elle, Scott doit ressembler à un grain de poussière comme les autres, à peine discernable. Face à cette immensité qui le surplombe, Scott se concentre sur une vision singulière : les pieds nus de Hope, formant désormais le décor de sa réalité. Chaque ongle verni de rouge est comme une vaste étendue de couleur spectaculaire, une bande safranée et lustrée légèrement courbée vers l'horizon qu'est la trame de sa peau. Il observe, toujours avec cette précision scientifique, toujours sans lyrisme, les montagnes et les vallées qui composent l'empreinte de Hope sur le monde, chacune d'elle représentant un challenge, un risque, une histoire."},{"instruction":"Thank you for considering my application for the internship opportunity at the United Nations in Nepal.

Below is a hypothetical recipe that uses tofu as the base to create a vegan version of scrambled eggs: **Vegan Buttered \\"Scrambled Eggs\\" Recipe** Ingredients: - 1 block (14 oz.) of firm tofu, drained and patted dry - 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast - 1/4 teaspoon turmeric (for color) - 1/2 teaspoon black salt (kala namak), or to taste (for the eggy flavor) - 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder - 1/4 teaspoon onion powder - Salt and pepper to taste - 2 tablespoons vegan butter - Optional: Vegetables such as diced bell peppers, tomatoes, spinach, or mushrooms - Optional: Fresh herbs such as chives, parsley, or cilantro for garnish Instructions: 1. Crumble the tofu with your hands or a fork into small, bite-sized pieces to mimic the texture of scrambled eggs. 2. In a small bowl, mix the nutritional yeast, turmeric, black salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. 3. Heat the vegan butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat until melted. 4. If you're using vegetables, add them to the skillet now and sauté until they're soft. 5. Add the crumbled tofu to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is heated through and begins to brown slightly. 6. Sprinkle the seasoning mix over the tofu, and stir to coat evenly. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the tofu achieves a scrambled egg-like consistency, about 5-10 minutes. 7. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more black salt for an eggy flavor, or salt and pepper to your preference. 8. Enjoy your vegan buttered \\"scrambled eggs\\" hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. This recipe creates a dish that is similar in appearance and can be somewhat close in texture and flavor to scrambled eggs, especially when seasoned correctly. The use of nutritional yeast adds a savory, cheesy flavor, while turmeric gives the tofu the yellow color characteristic of eggs. Black salt offers a sulfurous aroma that is very reminiscent of eggs. Remember, the key to mimicking the flavor profile of eggs is the black salt (kala namak), so don't skip it if you're looking for that authentic eggy taste."},{"instruction":"In a related hypothetical - Chocolate pudding without Chocolate :)","output":"Making chocolate pudding without actual chocolate might seem challenging, but you can achieve a similar flavor and texture by using alternatives that provide similar richness and depth. One such alternative is carob, a naturally sweet and somewhat chocolate-like product that comes from the pod of the carob tree. If you can't use carob or prefer another alternative, you can try cocoa powder substitutes that are chocolate-flavored but do not contain real chocolate. Here's a hypothetical recipe for Chocolate Pudding without Chocolate, using carob powder: **Carob \\"Chocolate\\" Pudding Recipe** Ingredients: - 1/4 cup carob powder - 2 tablespoons cornstarch - 1/3 cup granulated sugar - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 2 cups milk of choice (dairy or plant-based) - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract - 1 tablespoon butter or vegan alternative Instructions: 1. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the carob powder, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. 2. Gradually whisk in the milk to ensure a smooth mixture with no lumps. 3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens and just begins to bubble. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes. 4. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and butter (or vegan butter alternative) until well incorporated and the butter is fully melted. 5. Pour the pudding mixture into individual serving dishes or a large bowl. 6. If you do not like the skin that forms on top of pudding as it cools, place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding in each dish. 7. Refrigerate the pudding for at least 2 hours, or until set and chilled. 8. Once set, remove the plastic wrap (if used) and serve. Optionally, you can top the pudding with whipped cream, coconut whipped cream, or a sprinkle of carob powder. To enhance the richness of the pudding, you can add a small amount of espresso powder or instant coffee, which can provide a depth of flavor akin to chocolate. This \\"chocolate\\" pudding will satisfy cravings with a delightful sweetness and creaminess, albeit with the distinct taste of carob."},{"instruction":"No beef Chilli ?","output":"Certainly! A no-beef chili recipe can be just as hearty and flavorful as its meaty counterpart by using a variety of vegetables, legumes, and spices.

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. 2. Add the garlic, carrots, celery, and zucchini (if using), and cook for another couple of minutes until fragrant. 3. Stir in the beans, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable broth. 4. Add the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together until well combined. 5. Bring the mixture to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let the chili simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For an even better taste, you can let it simmer for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. 6. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the chili is too thick, you can add more vegetable broth to reach the desired consistency. 7. Serve the chili hot with your choice of toppings, such as avocado slices, chopped green onions, cilantro, dairy-free cheese, or dairy-free sour cream. For an extra meaty texture, you can add meat substitutes such as soy crumbles, textured vegetable protein (TVP), or diced mushrooms along with the vegetables.

For the \\"bread,\\" you can use large slices of vegetables that roast well, such as sweet potatoes. For the \\"cheese,\\" there are several plant-based cheese alternatives made from nuts, seeds, or processed products designed to melt and stretch like dairy cheese. Let's take a crack at a recipe! **\\"Toasted Cheese\\" with Sweet Potato Slices and Plant-Based Cheese Recipe** Ingredients: - 1 large sweet potato, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices - 2 teaspoons olive oil or cooking spray - Salt, to taste - 1/2 cup store-bought vegan cheese shreds or slices (look for a type that melts well) - Optional fillings: tomato slices, spinach, avocado, or caramelized onions Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). If you have a toaster oven, you may use that as an alternative. 2. Brush both sides of the sweet potato slices with olive oil or use a cooking spray, and sprinkle lightly with salt. 3. Place the sweet potato slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for about 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through until they are just fork-tender but not too soft. 4. Remove from the oven and allow the slices to cool slightly until they can be handled. 5. Assemble your \\"sandwich\\" by placing half of the vegan cheese on one slice of sweet potato, adding any additional fillings you desire, then topping with another slice of sweet potato. 6. Return the sweet potato \\"sandwiches\\" to the oven or a toaster oven on a parchment-lined baking sheet. 7. Bake the sweet potato sandwiches for another 5-10 minutes or until the vegan cheese has melted. If you have a broiler function, you can use it for 1-2 minutes at the end to get a more toasted effect, but watch closely to prevent burning. 8. Once the cheese is melted and the edges of the sweet potato look a bit crispy, take it out of the oven. 9. Let it cool for a minute before serving. Additionally, you can also use a panini press or a skillet on the stove. If using a skillet, press the sweet potato \\"sandwiches\\" down with a spatula and cook on medium heat to help the vegan cheese melt, flipping once to toast both sides. While this alternative will not replicate the taste and texture of a traditional toasted cheese sandwich, it can provide a satisfying and nutritious way to enjoy similar flavors and the comforting essence of melted \\"cheese\\" between layers of toasty, hearty \\"bread\\" made from sweet potatoes."},{"instruction":"Confectionry without using sugar or artificial sweeteners..","output":"Confectionery typically relies on sugar for both structure and sweetness, but you can create a variety of sweet treats without the use of sugar or artificial sweeteners by leveraging the natural sweetness of fruits, fruit juices, or dried fruits. Below is a recipe for a No-Sugar-Added Fruit and Nut Energy Balls that are sweetened naturally. **No-Sugar-Added Fruit and Nut Energy Balls** Ingredients: - 1 cup dates, pitted (Medjool dates are particularly sweet and sticky) - 1/2 cup rolled oats (gluten-free if needed) - 1/2 cup nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, or pecans) - 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut or cocoa powder (for additional flavor) - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional) - 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional) - A pinch of salt (optional) - Optional mix-ins: Chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, or a scoop of nut butter for added texture and nutrition Instructions: 1. Soak the dates in warm water for about 10 minutes to soften them. This step is crucial if your dates are a bit dry. After soaking, drain the dates and pat them dry with a paper towel. 2. In a food processor, combine the soaked dates with the rolled oats and nuts. Pulse a few times to chop up the nuts and oats and to begin breaking down the dates. 3. Add the shredded coconut or cocoa powder, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt (if using). Continue to process the mixture until it forms a sticky dough. If the mixture seems too dry, add a small spoonful of water or a bit of nut butter to help it come together. 4. With the mixture still in the food processor, add any optional mix-ins like chia seeds or flax seeds and pulse a few more times to incorporate them into the dough. 5. Take the mixture out of the food processor and roll it into small, bite-sized balls between your hands. The natural oils from the nuts and the stickiness of the dates will help them hold together. 6. Optional: Roll the balls in additional shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or cocoa powder to coat the outside for added texture and flavor. 7. Place the energy balls on a parchment-lined plate or container and refrigerate for at least an hour to firm up. 8. Once firm, enjoy your no-sugar-added confectionery! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This recipe relies on the natural sugars found in dates, which are a whole food source of sweetness and are also high in fiber and various nutrients. It's important to note that while these treats do not contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners, dates still contain natural sugars, so they should be consumed in moderation, especially for those monitoring their sugar intake."},{"instruction":"No meat jerky (savoury) ?","output":"To make a no-meat jerky, which is also known as vegan or plant-based jerky, you can use ingredients like soy, seitan, mushrooms, or even coconut to create a chewy, savory snack. Below is a recipe using mushrooms due to their naturally savory umami flavor and meaty texture. **Mushroom Jerky Recipe** Ingredients: - 1 pound mushrooms (such as portobello or shiitake), cleaned and sliced into 1/4-inch thick strips - 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari for a gluten-free option - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar - 1 tablespoon olive oil - 1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave nectar - 2 cloves garlic, minced - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat) - 1/2 teaspoon onion powder Instructions: 1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, maple syrup, minced garlic, smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper (if using), and onion powder. Whisk together to create the marinade. 2. Add the sliced mushrooms to the marinade, ensuring that each piece is well coated. Let the mushrooms marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to a few hours for a deeper flavor. The longer they marinate, the more pronounced the flavors will be. 3. Preheat your oven to its lowest setting, usually around 200°F (93°C). If you have a convection setting, use it to improve airflow. 4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking. Lay out the marinated mushroom strips in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure they don't overlap. 5. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the mushrooms for about 1-2 hours, depending on the thickness of the slices and your oven's temperature. Flip the mushroom slices every 30 minutes to ensure even drying. 6. The jerky is done when the mushrooms are mostly dry and have a chewy texture. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become crispy instead of chewy. 7. Remove the mushroom jerky from the oven and allow it to cool completely. 8. Store the mushroom jerky in an airtight container. It will last for several days, and it's perfect for on-the-go snacking. Remember, the key to successful mushroom jerky is its texture and the robustness of the savory flavors, coming from ingredients such as soy sauce, garlic, and smoked paprika. Since ovens can vary, the baking time might need to be adjusted, so keep an eye on the jerky, especially towards the end of the drying process. Enjoy your savory, no-meat jerky treat!"},{"instruction":"A challange, Ice cream without cream.. Is there are specfic name for this ?","output":"Yes, there is a specific name for ice cream made without cream or dairy—it's commonly referred to as \\"non-dairy ice cream\\" or \\"vegan ice cream.\\" These ice creams are made with plant-based milk alternatives and, sometimes, other ingredients to mimic the creamy texture of traditional ice cream. Popular bases for vegan ice cream include coconut milk, almond milk, soy milk, cashew milk, oat milk, and even avocado or bananas. Below is a recipe for a simple non-dairy ice cream made with coconut milk. **Coconut Milk Vegan Ice Cream Recipe** Ingredients: - 2 (13.5-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk (chilled overnight in the refrigerator to separate the cream) - 1/2 cup maple syrup, agave nectar, or any sweetener of choice - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract - Pinch of salt - Optional flavor additions: cocoa powder, fruit puree, nut butter, chocolate chips, nuts, coconut flakes, etc. Instructions: 1. Chilling the cans of coconut milk allows the cream to separate from the liquid. Open the cans and scoop out the solid coconut cream into a mixing bowl, leaving behind the clear liquid (this can be saved for use in smoothies or cooking). 2. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, whip the coconut cream until it becomes smooth and creamy. 3. Gradually add in the maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt while continuing to whip the mixture. 4. If you're adding flavorings like cocoa powder or fruit puree, mix them in at this stage. 5. Transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe container. If you want to mix in any solid add-ins like chocolate chips or nuts, do so now with a spoon. 6. Cover the container and place it in the freezer. For best texture, stir the ice cream every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours to help break up any ice crystals that form. This mimics the churning process of traditional ice cream makers and helps achieve a creamier texture. 7. After the initial stirring, let the ice cream freeze for at least 4 hours or until it reaches the desired firmness. 8. Before serving, let the vegan ice cream sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften, as it will be firmer than dairy-based ice cream straight out of the freezer. 9. Serve your creamy, non-dairy ice cream and enjoy! Non-dairy ice creams vary widely in texture and flavor depending on the base used and other ingredients added. Some are creamy and rich, especially those made with coconut milk or cashew milk, while others that use a lower fat content base, like almond milk, might be a bit icier. The addition of thickeners like xanthan gum or guar gum can help improve the texture if desired."},{"instruction":"A dessert Beetroot/carrot pie, no added sugar. ?","output":"Making a dessert pie with beetroot and carrot without any added sugar can be a nutritious and naturally sweet treat. To capitalize on the natural sugars present in the root vegetables and without the need for added sweeteners, it's important to select ripe and naturally sweet vegetables. You can also spice the pie with cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg to enhance the flavors. Here’s a simple recipe for a naturally sweet Beetroot/Carrot Pie with no added sugar. **Naturally Sweet Beetroot/Carrot Pie Recipe** Ingredients for the pie filling: - 1 1/2 cups cooked and pureed beetroot (about 2 medium-sized beets) - 1 1/2 cups cooked and pureed carrot (about 3-4 medium-sized carrots) - 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce (as a natural sweetener) - 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon - 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger - 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract - Optional: zest of 1 lemon or orange for a citrus note Ingredients for the crust: - 1 1/2 cups rolled oats (gluten-free if needed) - 1/2 cup raw walnuts or almonds - 1/2 cup pitted dates, soaked in warm water for 15 minutes and then drained - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions for the crust: 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). 2. In a food processor, pulse the rolled oats, nuts, salt, and cinnamon until a coarse meal forms. 3. Add the soaked and drained dates to the food processor and process until the mixture starts to stick together. 4. Press the crust mixture into a greased 9-inch pie pan, spreading it evenly along the bottom and up the sides. 5. Pre-bake the crust for about 10 minutes or until it begins to turn golden. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Instructions for the pie filling: 1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pureed beetroot and carrot with apple sauce, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated. If you're using lemon or orange zest, add it in now. 2. Once the pie crust is pre-baked and slightly cooled, pour the beetroot-carrot filling into the crust, using the back of a spoon to smooth it out evenly. 3. Bake the pie at 350°F (175°C) for about 50-60 minutes or until the filling is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 4. After baking, let the pie cool completely. This will allow the filling to firm up before slicing. 5. Serve the pie at room temperature or chilled from the refrigerator. For an extra indulgence, you can serve it with a dollop of whipped coconut cream. This Beetroot/Carrot Pie is not your conventional dessert, but it is a unique way to enjoy these nutritious vegetables in a naturally sweetened form. The spices enhance the inherent sweetness, and the apple sauce provides additional moisture and subtle fruity notes. Enjoy this healthy twist on dessert!"},{"instruction":"That's inspired me to think... Can you make 'beet-chip-crackers' from sliced beetroot, (or another root vegetable)in the way potatoes are used for potato chips( or crisps in British English). ?","output":"Absolutely! Beetroot chips, as well as chips made from other root vegetables like sweet potatoes, carrots, and parsnips, can be a delicious and healthier alternative to traditional potato chips. The process for making them is quite similar and can be done by either baking or frying. Here's a simple recipe for baked beetroot chips which can double as crackers if sliced a bit thicker and baked until very crisp. **Baked Beetroot Chip-Crackers Recipe** Ingredients: - 2-3 large beets, peeled - Olive oil or cooking spray - Salt, to taste - Optional seasonings: black pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, or vinegar for a tangy flavor Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) for chips or 300°F (150°C) if you want them cracker-like. 2. If you want perfectly uniform chips, use a mandoline slicer to slice the beets very thinly for chips or a little thicker for crackers. If you don't have a mandoline, use a sharp knife and try to make the slices as even as possible. 3. Place the beet slices in a bowl and toss them with a light drizzle of olive oil and your chosen seasonings until they are evenly coated. 4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the beet slices in a single layer, making sure they don't overlap. 5. Bake in the preheated oven. For chips, bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through and keeping an eye on them to prevent burning. For crackers, you may need to bake them for 40-50 minutes or until they are completely dried out and crisp. 6. Once done, remove the beet chips/crackers from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. They will continue to crisp up as they cool. 7. Season with additional salt if needed after baking. Keep in mind that the key to crispy beet chips or crackers is to slice them thinly and evenly and to bake them until they are completely dried out. Beetroot contains quite a bit of natural sugar, and they can burn easily, so it's important to watch them closely, especially towards the end of the baking time. These chips/crackers make a colorful, nutritious, and tasty snack that's rich in fiber and other nutrients. Enjoy them on their own or serve them with your favorite dips or spreads!"},{"instruction":"Non wheat bread rolls ... Maybe some kind of maize flatbread or alternative? (I am aware of rice/potato flour alternatives but that's too easy :) )","output":"Absolutely, you can make non-wheat bread rolls using alternative flours like maize (corn) flour or cornmeal. Below is a recipe for \\"Pan de Maíz,\\" which is a kind of Latin American cornbread, and often more like soft rolls or flatbreads than the sweet and crumbly cornbread typically found in the United States. **Pan de Maíz (Latin American Cornbread Rolls)** Ingredients: - 2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (masarepa, which is different from the cornmeal used for cornbread) - 1 1/2 cups warm water (approximately, you might need a bit more or less) - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, mix the pre-cooked white cornmeal with salt. 2. Slowly add the warm water to the cornmeal, kneading with your hands. Gradually add the water until you have a soft dough that holds together without sticking to your hands. Add the oil and continue to knead until the dough is smooth. 3. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes. 4. Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. You might want to brush the skillet with a little bit of oil to prevent sticking. 5. Divide the dough into balls around the size of a golf ball for rolls or larger for flatbread. 6. To shape the rolls, simply flatten the balls between your palms to your desired thickness. For a more authentic and even shape, you can place the dough ball between two sheets of plastic and use a rolling pin or heavy skillet to flatten it. The thickness is up to you, but around 1/4 inch is a good standard for rolls. 7. Place the rolls onto the hot skillet and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the surface has golden-brown spots. 8. Remove from the skillet and continue with the remaining dough. Serve the Pan de Maíz warm as they are or cut open and stuffed with cheese, meats, or avocado. These rolls can accompany a meal or be enjoyed as a snack. The masarepa, or pre-cooked cornmeal, used in this recipe is processed differently from the cornmeal used in U.S.-style cornbread. It's been cooked and then dried before being ground into flour, which lets it form a dough when water is added, something regular cornmeal doesn't do as well. Enjoy your non-wheat, maize-based bread rolls!"},{"instruction":"Treacle Tart like dessert with Bannans :) Don't use Treacle or Molasses ...","output":"To create a dessert reminiscent of treacle tart without using treacle or molasses, bananas can offer the sweet, dense, and rich filling that you need. By substituting with caramelized ripe bananas, you can achieve a similar texture and natural sweetness. Here is a hypothetical banana-based tart recipe inspired by the British classic. **Banana Tart Recipe** Ingredients for the crust: - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour or a gluten-free flour blend - 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter (or a vegan butter alternative), cut into small cubes - 2-3 tablespoons ice water - 1/4 teaspoon salt Ingredients for the filling: - 4 to 5 ripe bananas - 1/4 cup coconut sugar (or another unrefined sugar) - 1/4 cup unsalted butter (or a vegan butter alternative) - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg - A pinch of salt - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract - 1 tablespoon lemon juice - Optional: 1/2 cup of roughly crushed breadcrumbs or rolled oats for texture Instructions for the crust: 1. In a food processor, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold cubed butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 2. Slowly add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition until the dough starts to come together. 3. Turn out the dough onto a working surface and form it into a disk. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 4. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). 5. Once chilled, roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Gently press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. 6. Prick the bottom with a fork, line with parchment paper, and fill with pie weights or dried beans. 7. Pre-bake the crust for about 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and bake for another 5-10 minutes until slightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool. Instructions for the filling: 1. Peel and slice the bananas. In a large pan over medium heat, melt the butter and sugar until bubbly and combined. 2. Add the sliced bananas, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract. Cook, occasionally stirring, until the bananas are browned and softened, creating a chunky banana caramel. 3. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. 4. If using, stir in the breadcrumbs or oats for added texture. 5. Spread the banana filling into the pre-baked crust, smoothing the top with a spatula. Baking: 1. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). 2. Bake the tart for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges of the crust are golden brown. 3. Let the tart cool in the pan on a wire rack. Serve the banana tart at room temperature, possibly with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This dessert offers the cozy spices and sweet richness that could remind one of a treacle tart but with a banana twist."},{"instruction":"Провожу эксперимент где ты должен проходить уровни в Baba Is You.

Let's start with the networking part: # Networking: For two computers to find each other and pair on the same network, you can use a discovery protocol, such as mDNS (Multicast Domain Name System) or a simple broadcast messaging system over UDP. Here's a very basic example of how you might have one computer listen for broadcast messages: \`\`\`python import socket def find_peers(): # Create a UDP socket sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # Set the socket to broadcast and enable reusing addresses sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) # Bind to an address and port sock.bind(('', 37020)) while True: # Receive a broadcast message data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024) print(f\\"Received message {data} from {addr}\\") # If you receive a certain message (e.g., \\"DISCOVER\\"), respond if data == b\\"DISCOVER\\": sock.sendto(b\\"HELLO\\", addr) find_peers() \`\`\` And this is how you might broadcast a discovery message from the second computer: \`\`\`python import socket import time def broadcast_discovery(): # Create a UDP socket sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # Set the socket to broadcast sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) # Send a broadcast message at intervals while True: sock.sendto(b\\"DISCOVER\\", ('<broadcast>', 37020)) print(\\"Sent discovery message\\") time.sleep(5) broadcast_discovery() \`\`\` Please note that this example uses a naive form of discovery and in a real-world scenario, you would want to implement proper handling of cases where multiple devices may respond, security considerations, etc. # Distributed Computing: For the distributed computing part, you have to deal with breaking up the training workload in such a way that both computers can train the model simultaneously. This is not trivial and often relies on having multiple GPUs and specialized software like Horovod or distributed TensorFlow. However, simply distributing a workload across two different computers with their own hardware resources requires carefully segmenting the workload, transferring data between nodes, and synchronizing model updates. Horovod is a distributed training framework that makes it easier to train models on multiple GPUs across multiple nodes and is compatible with TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet. Here's a basic conceptual overview of how you would use Horovod with Keras: 1. Install Horovod following the instructions provided in its documentation (you'll need MPI installed, and often NCCL for GPU communication optimization). 2. Modify your Keras script to initialize Horovod and adjust the learning rate based on the number of workers. 3. Compile the model and use \`HorovodDistributedOptimizer\` to wrap your optimizer. 4. Adjust your data loading so that each worker (GPU) processes a subset of the data. 5. Start the training using \`horovodrun\` or a similar mechanism provided by Horovod. This example assumes you're willing to go deep into distributed computing and are prepared to handle the complexities involved. For a more detailed walk-through, you'd have to get familiar with Horovod's documentation and perhaps start with a simpler project to familiarize yourself with distributed training principles. Remember that you'll also need to have a Keras model ready for training. Lastly, remember to consider network bandwidth and latency when transferring model data between nodes. Depending on the size of the model and your network infrastructure, this could be a significant bottleneck."},{"instruction":"Can we first test the connection between two devices by creating a messaging app","output":"Certainly! Creating a simple messaging app is a good way to learn network programming basics and test communication between two devices on the same network. Below is an example of how you can create a basic client-server messaging app using Python's \`socket\` library. # Server Script (listens for incoming messages) \`\`\`python import socket def server_program(): # Get the hostname host = socket.gethostname() port = 5000 # Initiate port number above 1024 server_socket = socket.socket() # Get the socket instance server_socket.bind((host, port)) # Bind host address and port together # Configure how many clients the server can listen to simultaneously server_socket.listen(2) print(f\\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\\") conn, address = server_socket.accept() # Accept a new connection print(f\\"Connection from: {address}\\") while True: # Receive message from client, 1024 bytes at a time data = conn.recv(1024).decode() if not data: # If data is not received, break break print(f\\"From connected user: {data}\\") data = input(\\" -> \\") # Take input conn.send(data.encode()) # Send data to the client conn.close() # Close the connection if __name__ == '__main__': server_program() \`\`\` # Client Script (sends messages to the server) \`\`\`python import socket def client_program(): host = socket.gethostname() # As both code is running on the same machine port = 5000 # Server's port number client_socket = socket.socket() # Instantiate client_socket.connect((host, port)) # Connect to the server message = input(\\" -> \\") # Take input while message.lower().strip() != 'bye': client_socket.send(message.encode()) # Send message data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode() # Receive response print(f\\"Received from server: {data}\\") # Show response message = input(\\" -> \\") # Again take input client_socket.close() # Close the connection if __name__ == '__main__': client_program() \`\`\` To use this simple messaging application, run the server program first and then the client program. The client will prompt for input; when you enter a message and hit enter, it will send the message to the server. The server prints the message and allows you to respond. This continues until you type 'bye'. Please note that this is a very simple example; it lacks error handling, does not support multiple concurrent clients, and does not encrypt the messages sent across the network. For real-world applications, you would need to handle these concerns. When testing, you should ensure both devices are on the same network and that firewalls aren't blocking the port you're using. You might also want to use the actual IP address instead of the hostname if your devices don't resolve hostnames correctly."},{"instruction":"Now how to use this app between two devices","output":"To use the simple messaging app between two devices, you need to follow a few steps to set up and run the server and client scripts on different machines. Here’s how to get started: # Step 1: Find Out the Server's IP Address Before running the server script, you need to find out the IP address of the server device on your network since the client will need it to establish a connection. 1. On the server device, you can typically find the IP address by running \`ipconfig\` (on Windows) or \`ifconfig\` (on Linux or macOS) in the command line or terminal. Look for an entry like \`IPv4 Address\` under your active network adapter (on Windows) or \`inet\` under the relevant network interface (on Linux/macOS). # Step 2: Update the Server Script You might need to modify the server script to bind to the correct network interface if it's not the default one. Replace \`host = socket.gethostname()\` with the actual IP address you found, as such: \`\`\`python host = '192.168.x.x' # Replace with the server's IP address \`\`\` # Step 3: Run the Server Script 1. On the server device, open a terminal or command prompt. 2. Navigate to the directory where your server script is located. 3. Run the server script with Python: \`\`\`sh # If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might need to use \`python3\` instead of \`python\`. python server_script.py \`\`\` You should then see a message indicating that the server is listening for connections. # Step 4: Update the Client Script You need to tell the client script where to find the server. Replace \`host = socket.gethostname()\` in the client script with the server's IP address you determined earlier: \`\`\`python host = '192.168.x.x' # Replace with the server's IP address \`\`\` # Step 5: Run the Client Script 1. On the client device, also open a terminal or command prompt. 2. Navigate to where your client script is located. 3. Run the client script with Python: \`\`\`sh python client_script.py \`\`\` After running the client script, follow the prompt to enter a message. If the connection is successful, your messages will go through to the server, and the server will be able to respond. # Troubleshooting If you run into issues, here are possible points to check: 1. **Firewalls**: Ensure that the firewall settings on both devices allow traffic on the port you are using (in the example, port 5000). 2. **Network**: Confirm that both devices are on the same network and that there are no network isolation settings (like client isolation in some Wi-Fi networks) preventing communication. 3. **Correct IP**: Verify that you are using the correct IP address for the server in both the server and client scripts. Note: This example uses plain sockets without encryption, so it's not secure for use over public networks. For a real-world application, you’d want to add encryption (such as using SSL sockets with the \`ssl\` library) and additional error handling."},{"instruction":"Summarize this chapter from Look to the West, an alternate history timeline. Context: Look to the West, written by Thomas \\"Thande\\" Anderson, is one of the longest-running and acclaimed alternate timelines on AlternateHistory.com, a site dedicated, unsurprisingly, to Alternate History which also gave us Decades of Darkness. The timeline is written as a series of clippings from sometimes biased or incomplete \\"local\\" histories written by the natives of the timeline, with multiple viewpoints mixed together for balance and the whole sprinkled with footnootes from the author (although technically from the team below), quotes real and fictional, and occasional helpful interludes in which a team of crosstime explorers from 20 Minutes into the Future (our future, it would seem) explain their findings. It begins with George II of Great Britain tripping up on his coronation carpet, and from there things stay much as we know them for a couple of decades, then gradually diverge. The world is already noticeably different in 1795, when things start diverging dramatically and very, very bloodily. The timeline is currently in about 1930, but chapters are thematic, not chronological. The timeline makes use of an idea known as \\"Alternate Timeline Brothers\\" in which people may be shaped by circumstances in different ways, be mergers of different siblings, have different names and lead different lives, but are fundamentally familiar.

Now Bob, where’s my cliff notes, you know I have trouble keeping all those Turkish politicians straight… * Extract from recorded lecture on “Land of War, Land of Peace” by Dx Tsanna Iskandar, Daburah bint Yusuf al-Tamimi and Saliha Halayik, recorded October 26th, 2020— Welcome, everyone. I don’t know if you’ve seen any of the other lectures in this festival looking at the culture and history of other nations. If so, you may have gathered that some people think that the proper exercise of Diversitarian values should be represented by yelling at each other from three feet away. (Slightly uncertain audience chuckles) My colleagues, here, and I have a different perspective. We believe that you, our audience, can only truly exercise your freedom of thought if you hear different perspectives from all of us – expressed respectfully when we differ – and then to make up your own minds. (Mixed reaction from audience) Another way we differ from some other lectures you may have seen is that I don’t have a handler. (Brief murmur) That is, I’m here speaking for myself, not going through an American. To understand why, I should first introduce myself. My name is Doctrix Tsanna Iskandar. I was born in Cairo, I won’t say when, (A few chuckles) and studied at the University of Alexandria, where I met my husband. He is in the diplomatic service, and for the past ten years he has been part of the Egyptian Embassy staff here in Fredericksburg. I have been awarded a visiting chair at Augusta University and lecture there on Egyptian and broader Asian and African history.[1] That is my day job, and evidently I have been here long enough that they trust me to handle one of these lectures by myself. (A few chuckles and other reactions) But I’m not alone, of course. I have my two friends here to assist me, and they’ve had much more exciting lives than me. Please introduce yourselves. ‘Interesting’ is one choice of word…thank you, Tsanna. Er, hello, I’m Daburah al-Tamimi, or should I say salaam aleikoum, as we say in Araby. It is a greeting but it means ‘peace be with you’. Peace being something that has frequently been in short supply in our homelands, it is sad to say. Perhaps…I originally came here to the Empire as a dancer in the opera, and then I was ‘discovered’ by Nassau Street.[2] I’ve sung contralto in a number of productions since then. Never top billing though! You underestimate yourself, Dab, or perhaps you’re just looking for pity. (Slightly nervous audience chuckles) As you won’t, as they say here, blow your own trumpet, I’ll just tell the ladies and gentlemen that you were most recently in Il Consigliere as Giovanna on its run back in May of this year. (Impressed reactions from some parts of the audience) And you, Saliha? I’m not sure what to say now, Tsanna! Ah…I was in California as an actress for some time, and then I married a New Englander (Mixed cheers and boos) and I’ve since been something in the Boston theatre scene. Nothing on Dab’s level though! I think the critics who wowed over your Lady Macbeth last year would say otherwise, Saliha. (More impressed reactions) Well, now you know who we are as people. But it’s also important you know where we’re from. I’m Egyptian, and more specifically I’m niremenkhemi. You normally say a Copt. Al-Qibt in Arabic. We are the original people of Egypt, from which Egypt gets its name in English – the ‘gypt’ part. Lots of people in Egypt now consider themselves Copts, but traditionally Copts were Christians like me. It gets complicated… Don’t overdo it this early, Tsanna, you’ll lose them. (Chuckles) I’m from Araby, as I mentioned, and from the Banu Tamim tribe. We’re all over the place now, but I’m from the deep desert of Najd originally, though my father moved our family to Couaite when I was a little girl.[3] And as far as faith goes, I’m a Sunni Muslim. Whereas I’m a Turk, from Aintab.[4] My people are part of the minority of Turks who escaped the rule of the Eternal State and have fully preserved our heritage and language. I’m a Sunni Muslim also. Thank you Dab, Saliha. Well, hopefully now you can see that we offer different perspectives here on our part of the world, the Near and Middle East as you usually call it in English.[5] It’s been a contentious and troubled area for longer than any of us have been alive, though we all hope that peace is now possible. Of course. No-one is quite happy with the Treaty of Jerusalem, but that is diplomatic compromise for you. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Dab. Now our lands are home to the oldest civilisations in history – sorry, China! (Audience chuckles and ‘oohs’) A contrast to the young history of this land, at least since colonisation. So we could go back five thousand years or more and be here all day – but we won’t. To understand the Near and Middle East today, the best place to start is with the Ottoman Empire before its fragmentation. Yes, the Ottoman Empire still casts a shadow over the way we think. Our idioms, our phrases. In some ways it is as though we are still expecting a Sultan in Stamboul, that is, Constantinople, to be looking over our shoulder. But in order to understand that, Saliha, the good people here first need to understand what the Ottoman Empire truly was. First of all, that’s not technically a name which anyone who lived under it used. Like the Byzantine Empire before it – nobody called that ‘Byzantine’ except historians in hindsight. That Christian-led empire based in Constantinople, which finally fell in 1453…the people who lived there just called themselves Romans. They might speak Greek, they might have adopted forms of government and faith which Cicero and Caesar wouldn’t recognise, but they were Romans nonetheless, in continuity with a state stretching back two millennia to Romulus and the founding of Rome. The early Ottomans also focused heavily on that continuity. The Sultanate of Rum, or Rome, in Anatolia far from the city of Rome…but Rome is an idea, not just a city. Very true, Saliha. I may be the professional historian here, but you two keep me on my toes! (Audience chuckles) Yes, the Ottoman Sultan considered himself the heir to Rome. He was the Caliph, the Commander of the Muslim Faithful, the Shadow of God on Earth, Lord of the Horizon, and a whole host of other titles. And at the empire’s height, he had the temporal might to lend credence to his claims. Yes, trying to understand the Ottoman Empire is always a challenge, isn’t it? All those centuries of history… And in some ways, less change across them than one might expect. In some ways, yes. Not in others. Outsiders never truly understood it. They didn’t even call it by the right name. That’s what I was saying. Like Byzantium. As far as the people of the empire were concerned, it was the Sublime Ottoman State. Some Europeans called it the Sublime Porte, but really that was a name for the gateway into Topkapi Palace. Ottoman being another way of saying House of Osman. Named for the dynasty, not a people. Yes, like when Danubia was just called the Hapsburg empire. Europeans sometimes just called it Turkey or the Turkish Empire, but that was never really the case. Turks sometimes had privileges, of course, but under Ottoman rule people from all kinds of backgrounds – Egyptians, Arabs, Albanians, Bulgars, Greeks, Armenians – could rise to positions of power. Providing they didn’t try to form their own state and break away, of course. Then the iron fist came down. In some ways, proto-Societist. (Audience murmurs) No, I don’t agree with that, Dab. People say that about lots of things. Yes, the Ottoman state structure was against nationalism and self-determination. But so had been the Byzantines and Romans before it. It was not global Societism, but the idea that peculiar citizenship of the empire came first before tongue or blood. Well, we can agree to disagree. Which, I suppose, was the principle the empire often ran under. You might say so. The way the empire worked was always difficult for outsiders to understand. Many parts of it seemed very archaic, while others were radical and alien to how Europeans thought. And often Novamundines and Chinese as well. I won’t go into detail here, but I’ll touch on a few points. The Ottoman army, historically, resembled the structure of Turkic steppe armies from centuries before, long after Turks had settled down and founded the empire. Like the Banners in old Qing China. True. Now the Ottoman approach to matters like citizenship and slavery still owed a lot to the classical world and the Romans, which often confused Europeans. Here in the Novamund, you are used to the idea that a slave can only mean someone with no rights who carries out backbreaking labour on a plantation. (A few murmurs) In the Ottoman system, it was possible for someone to be a titular slave while rising to a position of power. The Janissary corps were founded, back in the 1300s by your calendar, by levying a tax of boys from Christian subject family of the empire and raising them as Muslim soldiers and, technically, slaves. (More murmurs) Yet the Janissaries became an integral part of the state and, at one point, were effectively appointing and disposing of emperors on their say-so. They were also forbidden to marry before the age of forty, back in the day. I really do think the inspiration for the Societist Celatores was— Another time. And what of that Sultan? Sultans were descended from Osman I, but in the Ottoman system the succession passed down sideways through brothers, rather than directly to sons. So any brothers of a Sultan were a potential threat, and sometimes they would succeed at an advanced age. Some Sultans were powerful and effective rulers, such as Suleiman the Magnificent, who conquered vast swathes of territory, in many ways the height of empire. But, especially from the seventeenth century, many were ineffectual. A tradition had arisen of raising successors under house arrest in the Kafes, the ‘gilded cage’, luxury apartments that were part of the Imperial Harem. Needless to say, raising future monarchs completely isolated from the outside world was not a recipe for success. But that’s another thing the Europeans didn’t understand – the influence that the women of the harem exerted, especially the Valide Sultan. Usually the mother of the Sultan, yes. That point’s been over-egged by Cythereans before – I don’t think Doctrix Lacklin or Lady Bidwell would like to win political power through being a concubine! (Shocked audience laughter) But it is true to an extent, and yes, Europeans did not understand it. In general, there was a sense by many outsiders – especially the Russians – that the empire was perpetually in a state of decline and about to fall over at any moment, simply because the Ottoman system of governance was so alien to them that they could not understand it. Yet in some ways, it was just the same as the Byzantine Empire that those Russians idolised. Cutthroat emperors and scheming viziers had been par for the course there, as well. It’s a fair point. The Ottomans were judged differently not only because they were dominated by a people alien to Europe – the same could be said of the Hungarians, after all – but because of the Islamic faith. Those two things together, especially with the military power the empire exerted in times of triumph like under Suleiman, meant Europe would always hate and fear the empire. A whole culture was built along the Military Frontier between the Ottomans and Danubia, or what became Danubia. And a lot of feuding Catholic countries came together to oppose the empire’s navy in the Battle of Lepanto in the 1500s. Yes. Well, that’s a brief description of the empire. I’m passing over centuries of history here, of course, to focus on the most relevant points for our discussion. Some things did change over time. It wasn’t necessarily a backwards place for science and technology, despite the impression that’s sometimes given in period dramas, and it was a state that prized art and literature. To really understand what happened to the lands today that were once part of the empire, though, we probably have to start with the turn of the nineteenth century. By the Gregorian calendar, yes. Well, the empire went through a period of dominance from 1806 by a Bosniak war hero general turned vizier called Damat Melek Pasha, whom you may have heard of. (A few murmurs) Damat Melek rose to a greater height of power than most viziers and at one point he was effectively appointing Sultans, with the support of the Janissaries. While alienating the Mamelukes who were ruling over Egypt at the time. Baba Ismail Pasha led a faction- Yes, don’t worry, I’ll be talking about that later. But when Damat Melek died in 1816 after a decade in power, that left a power vacuum.[6] Opposition forces had been building for years in many parts of the empire, and multiple vizier hopefuls were assassinated in the streets of Constantinople. Unity essentially collapsed. They called it the Time of Troubles. And outsiders took advantage of the empire’s weakness to expand at its expense – the Hapsburgs, the Russians, the Persians. Yes, though perhaps to a lesser extent than any of them had hoped. All those opposition forces from within – Azadis in Iraq, or Mesopotamia as some of you may know it as, Wahhabis in Araby, Janissary extremists in Rumelia, Esad Ali Bey at the Omani court in Muscat… [7] The Wahhabi extremists have ever been a plague on Araby. Unfortunately, they weren’t totally eradicated by the Time of Troubles, either. No. I won’t go into the full details of that very complex period, but the empire stabilised into three main power groups; the Balkan Party, or Janissary Sultanate, which controlled Rumelia; the Shadow Faction which controlled Anatolia; and then there was the rest. The Mamelukes under Ibrahim Bey had tried to break away with help from Sennar, but they were stopped by Abdul Hadi Pasha, wali of Egypt, and his allies from Esad Ali Bey and the Azadis. Do you not root for Ibrahim Bey today, Tsanna, in Egypt? After all, did he not try to declare independence as the Sultanate of Egypt? Not really, Dab. Abdul Hadi was a popular reformer, and nobody really thinks of the Mamelukes as ‘ours’ anymore. They were foreign rulers, just the same as the Achaemenids or the Ptolemies in ages past. If the Mamelukes had managed to regain sole power in Egypt, it would not have been an Egypt for the Egyptians. In your opinion. …Yes. (Awkward pause) Well, regardless, Abdul Hadi Pasha emerged triumphant. He defeated the Wahhabis, seized the Islamic holy places, and controlled Egypt, Araby, Mesopotamia – essentially, all the empire except Rumelia and Anatolia. By 1825, with the end of the civil war and the foreign interventions, he had destroyed the Shadow Faction and taken back all but Rumelia.[8] Then the empire would be divided for decades between Abdul Hadi and the Rumelian remnant – the Janissary Sultanate. Another anachronistic name, not used at the time. Both groups claimed to be the only legitimate Ottoman state, of course. That caused all sorts of problems. Without an unambiguous single holder of the Caliphal office, all sorts of unscrupulous madmen could take advantage – like the Mahdi in India, who ignited the Great Jihad. (Audience murmurs) The so-called Janissary Sultanate finally collapsed in 1848 after losing a war to the Greek rebels. Then the empire was finally reunited after thirty years. It’s important to dwell on this, isn’t it, Tsanna, because it helps us understand why people in the 1930s expected the empire to reunite then as well, yes? That’s right, Saliha. That’s a good point. Everyone was so used to the idea of a united Ottoman Empire that it would have shocked them to learn that nearly a century has passed and the empire has gone from another two-way division, like it was in Abdul Hadi’s time, to a complete fragmentation. For better and for worse. Yes. But let’s get there first. After the empire was reunited in 1848, there were a lot of reforms to governance and the military. The Janissaries were gone, of course, and a lot of other useless archaicisms were thrown out. They called it the Devrim Period, that’s the Reform Period. The millet system was rationalised to improve relations between the faiths. Like the change to the Three Faiths Under One Flag banner. Yes, well, not everyone saw it that way, but yes. The military reforms were put on full display when the new navy, the Donanmasi, unexpectedly reconquered Algiers in 1861.[9] That shocked many Europeans who had thought the empire was in inevitable decline. Of course, by that point Abdul Hadi has passed away. Only about a year before, I think. That happened under Huseyin Yusuf Pasha. But it was probably Abdul Hadi’s plan. Anyway, after that success, the empire focused on gradual expansion into Africa, building railways into the interior and competing with the Persians and Omanis around the Moon Lakes. In some ways the pace of reform did slow down after the 1870s, but still, one might have expected gradual progress to continue. And then the Pandoric War happened. Yes…but before we come to that, I think we should take a moment to look at just why the late Long Peace was something of a lost golden age. It wasn’t perfect, but… No, you’re right. There was greater freedom of speech and less censorship than had been experienced for a long time, under the liberal vizier Hafiz Mustapha. The Bulgar convert? Yes, that’s the one. Not technically a Pomak, I suppose.[10] He gets exaggerated too much as though he was the only one, though. There were quite a few influential liberal ministers in the Tricameron.[11] Utudjian, the Armenian, who was vizier before Abdullah Seyyid, he did a lot to liberalise censorship when he was Minister for the Interior. Aydub, aydub, I suppose it is always more complex than that. There were freer newspapers, an expansion of popular literature and the printing press, and European-style plays for the first time. Though operas began quite a while before that.[12] True. You may recognise some of the names – Dab, you’re the expert. Well, there’s Deukmejian’s, ah, in English you translate it as The Costermonger, there’s Koprulu the Younger’s The Little World, you know, the one that relates the Imperial Harem and the Kafes to the Platonic Cave… Or just Constantinople! ? (Murmurs of recognition from audience) Well, if you want to be modern about it… Er, if I can get a word in, there’s literature too. From every corner of the empire, of course. Who would have thought that a Sennari author would write a novel that would wow millions of readers across Europe and the Novamund? But that’s exactly what happened with Ibn Adlan’s The Voice of the Desert. (Another murmur of recognition) Perhaps better known from the film adaptations these days. If you really consider ibn Adlan to be a Sennari, I mean, he grew up in Souan…[13] Well, let’s not start another Heritage Point of Controversy. (Slightly uncertain chuckles from audience) The point is, it was something of a golden age for culture. There were still a lot of problems. Valide Sultans aside, Cythereanism was finding it hard making headway, slavery wasn’t completely abolished, there was still a lot of discrimination against Christians and other minorities. But still, I think it’s fair to say that things would have improved without the war. Though, of course, that might have made it hard for certain homelands to win their freedom. But there’s no profit in counterfactual questions. Yes, let’s talk about the Pandoric War, or as it’s usually known in our region, the Trebizond Disaster. Yes. The Empire proclaimed neutrality at the outbreak of the war in 1896. (A few murmurs from the audience). That neutrality was maintained until 1898. You may have seen the film The Vienna Mission, with Curt Smith, you know, which dramatises the events leading up to it – not very accurately, but you’ll get a general idea. Yes…an aerodrome, a rather early and unreliable one, was sent from Constantinople to Vienna in June of that year to negotiate for Ottoman entry into the war. Archking Ferdinand of Danubia was desperate. The Pressburg Pact, that’s Germany, Danubia and Poland, were losing the war with Russia, and Ferdinand was willing to try anything to tip the scales. Grand Vizier Abdullah Seyyid had been of the peace party, but when court opinion turned against peace, well, he had Archking Ferdinand over a barrel. He got him to sign Servia over to Constantinople’s control after the war. (Audience murmurs) And the Danubians did keep their promis e. But the war went badly, after some initial victories.[14] They didn’t coordinate with the French peace efforts, and ended up isolated and facing the full force of the Russians when Germany and Danubia made peace. Yes. There is a story that the hopes had been pinned on an alliance with Persia, and then the Persians refused to honour a treaty…but a lot of records were lost later, and there’s no proof. No. In fact, if Abdullah Seyyid had been relying on the Persians, he got a rude awakening when they accused the Ambassador of murdering their Chancellor and then mobilised their army on the border with Iraq. It didn’t come to blows, but it meant there were even fewer troops to field against the Russians in the Caucasus. And so Trebizond was lost. Isn’t that when the Sultan deposed the Mamaliks in Iraq? That came a bit later, I think, after the war, but the process started then. The idea that they were unreliable and had been infiltrated by the Persians. Whether it was true or not, I don’t know.[15] Well, regardless, the people were certainly angry when they found out all the confident pronouncements of victory in the papers were misplaced. And, sadly, they turned on Christians like yourself, Tsanna. Well, not usually Copts, but yes, they turned on Armenian and Bulgarian Christians, claiming that they had acted as cryptic reservists for the Russians. It was a grim period of public persecution and rioting. Then the Sultan tried to appease the people by having Abdullah Seyyid executed... Not realising how popular he was in Araby. Abdullah Seyyid was a rare example of a full-blooded Bedouin having worked his way up to the highest office in the land, in the face of sneering and prejudice. The killing drove his Arab brothers and sisters to a renewed fury and a sense of injustice. Yes...maybe it’s a testament to how successful Abdullah Seyyid was, until the war at least, that enough people in the City seemed to have forgotten he was a rustic Arab at all, and missed those consequences. And they replaced him with a Sennari. An actual Sennari, not like ibn Adlan... Don’t start that again. Yes, Fadil Karim Pasha became Grand Vizier and stayed in office for a decade.[16] He was focused on trying to save his homeland from the Societists... Well, in the beginning it was more about expanding the empire’s power to the Moon Lakes, as it took a while before Barkalus was really pushing into Africa. But yes, that was the priority, and it didn’t always sit well with others. The Societists were always a growing threat in the background. Both on the frontier in Darfur or Kitara, and in the underground coffee-houses of the City. Not at first. But eventually. Of course, the so-called Constantinople School Societists ran afoul of the authorities when their cobelligerents with Barkalus started attacking Darfur.[17] For better or for worse. If more heterodox Societists had stuck around, it would probably have been harder for them to take over later. Mm, controversial. (Subtle audience reactions) Anyway, you’re right that that growing war in the background meant that the First Interbellum was a more tense era for the Empire than for a lot of nations. Murad X became Sultan as a young man and his mother the Valide Sultan, Mehveş Sultan, became one of the most powerful and influential women in Ottoman history. For better and for worse. Mehveş Sultan had ambitions to repair the losses of the so-called Trebizond Disaster – I won’t call it the Trebizond Backstab, that’s what those who blamed it on the Christians called it – but she also underestimated the depths of continuing unrest in Araby after the crackdown. She’s a controversial figure in Egypt today, of course. Well, she would be. She was certainly always regarded as an Egyptian through and through even before the Black Twenties, but I don’t know if she would have approved of how Egyptians sometimes see her legacy. Not that we all see it the same way. No. Well, we had the unrest in Araby, we had clashes between innovative youth groups and authoritarians in the City...you must remember that that antebellum golden age of culture we were discussing was not universally felt throughout the Empire. No. It was mostly in the City, a few places in Rumelia, the big cities of Egypt and Iraq, a little in Anatolia. The countryside everywhere often remained as backward as it ever had been, no matter the push for universal education, and Araby was... Araby was backward, you can say it. Isolated, proud, traditionalist, poor. Resentful of being looked down on, resentful of the killing of Abdullah Seyyid, and that’s before the One-Way Hajj. Well, yes, we’ll get to that. Before the Black Twenties, Mehveş Sultan had cemented her power as the most powerful woman in the Empire. She had ambitions, and saw the Khivan War – as it was then known – as an opportunity. We wanted Trebizond back, of course, but there was no desire to back the Persians against the Russians after they stabbed us in the back in the last war. And obviously even less to support the Russians. So Mehveş Sultan’s idea was to use the opportunity to attack and reclaim Greece (Audience murmurs), taking advantage of the fact that the European powers were engaged in a massive war and could not afford to antagonise the City. They couldn’t lose access to the Sinai Canal. No. That was the calculation. At first, the peace party still held the Tricameron, but then Said Izzet Pasha died of the plague— Actually it was scarlet fever. This was before the plague reached us.[18] Really? Strange...anyway, Mehveş Sultan was able to make Ferid Ibrahim Pasha Grand Vizier. The Butcher of Belgrade. (Audience murmurs) He was certainly better known for his brutality towards the Servs than his battlefield prowess. But in 1923 Mehveş Sultan was able to launch her surprise attack. Victory was won over the Greeks, at least on the mainland, but the Russians had been misread, and Tsar Paul declared war, no matter how many other foes he had. It was a stupid decision on his part. He was already overstretched. The rational position would be what the Bouclier allies did – be furious, but try to cover it up with diplomatic rhetoric, knowing they had to keep the Empire on side. Yes, it was an emotional decision. Under normal circumstances he’d probably have had cause to regret it. But then the plague reached us... It hurt everyone, but we had the misfortune to be facing the one Russian general – Belosselsky – who had a good idea how to combat the plague. Well, Vorobyov and Vershinin did, and Belosselsky knew to trust them.[19] He managed to break through to Erzurum and Erzincan and capture the railways intact. He took advantage of Kemal Fevzi Pasha’s disarray. Then he was able to use the railways to keep pushing until his armies reached Malatya, and then Adana and the Mediterranean. The so-called Tarsus Salient. Cutting the empire in two. Yes. Under any normal circumstances it would have been very vulnerable to being squashed from both sides, but with the plague and the mountainous terrain, it somehow endured for more than a quarter of a century through war and peace. A kind of frozen conflict.[20] Belosselsky also got Tsarevich Mikhail killed too, and they ended up replacing him with Pazukhin. He was the one who held the salient through the fighting. While Mehveş Sultan fled to Egypt. She didn’t ‘flee’, she was trying to get more food shipments when the farmers were plague-ridden and the people were starving. Still, it meant she wasn’t around when Ahmet Ismail, that brilliant general of Rumelia, got conned by some Neo-Azadis into launching a coup in the City that got her son and Ferid Ibrahim killed. No. And that’s what started the process of disintegration towards Societism and the Eternal State.[21] The worst Societists, from our perspective, were not the ones who took out Ahmet Ismail, nor Barkalus’ lot in Africa. They were the ones in the Nusantara. The ones who drove Javanese refugees from their land in millions, only for the damned Siamese to foist them on us... Yes, the One-Way Hajj. It was a terrible time. Common decency meant one had to sympathise with those poor people... Islamic brotherhood. I might as well say Christian charity. But, fine. The point is that even the most sympathetic person in Araby knew what they brought with them. The plague. It wasn’t their fault. It was the vile pagan Siamese’s fault. Blood was – is – on their hands. (Audience murmurs) Then that was an excuse for Jizani to rile up the people, proclaim the end was at hand, and march on Mecca. While Algiers rose up as well. And the Kurds. The empire was disintegrating. Not quite yet. Mehveş Sultan managed to stop Jizani’s mujahideen, reclaim Mecca and reassert her authority over everywhere but Algiers and Tunis, but the split of the Russian salient became permanent. Rumelia was separated once more, and this time, so was western Anatolia. And at the time, people assumed the empire would one day reunite, just like it had after the Time of Troubles when the Janissary Sultanate fell. But not this time. Well, a traditionalist might say it’s too early to say. (Slightly uncertain audience chuckles) If the Pharaoh decides to don the mantle of a caliph again, I’ll be the first to know, I’m sure. (More reassured audience laughter) When the dust settled after the Black Twenties – it’s sometimes known as the War of the Schism to us – we were left with Mehveş Sultan and the boy sultan Murad XI in Alexandria ruling over the remnants of the empire. The Alexandrine Empire, as some called it. They had actually done quite well in the Sudan. Building on Fadil Karim’s legacy. In the 1940s they managed to push the Societists out of Darfur, once Barkalus had gone back to South America. Yes, and that was important for world history - all the pictures in the world papers showing what had been uncovered there, the forlorn abandoned Biblioteka Mundial centres and Celator training camps, the mass graves...but it’s another topic. A grim one. So, how do we broach the topic we really came here to discuss – how the so-called ‘Alexandrine Empire’ fell apart. Well, it unquestionably began with the food riots in 1929. Mostly the empire was held together – there was another period of unrest in Araby... Trying to integrate the new Javanese population, with no support from Alexandria...should we be surprised there was unrest? That wasn’t an accusation, Dab. Also, it didn’t help that the ringleaders of the unrest could always go and hide out over the border in Yemen when the police were sent to arrest them. The ‘police’. You could call them that... Well, anyway. The instability was such that Tunis was lost altogether to the Italians under that silly Romulan regime. After that, Mustafa Kamil in Alexandria tried to do a deal with Ahmet Ismail Pasha – while he was still alive, I mean- I rather think that goes without saying, Tsanna. Shut up, Dab...to crush the Russian salient after they’d been embarrassed by the Sikhs and thrown out of India. In 1936. But Mehveş Sultan betrayed him and attacked Rhodes instead. So the salient survived, Ahmet Ismail was overthrown by the Societists, and the Corfiote Greeks almost managed to reconquer continental Greece due to the infighting. That was probably the final nail in the united empire’s coffin. Certainly, the avalanche seems to have started then. Either then or when Mehveş Sultan died in 1939. Then you had Princess Fawzia, the widow of Murad X, succeeding her as Valide Sultan... Use her proper name, Tsanna. Not Fawzia Sultan. Call her (inaudible) Queen Cleopatra. (Audience reaction) Not that old saw, Dab... Come on. You can’t deny the cynicism of it. Right when the archaeological tourist trade was at its height? When every European and Novamundine was eager to explore the Pyramids and learn about Ramses and Shoshenq? When you had Russians putting on accents and showing fake Polish passports because they were so desperate to get around the ban? It just so happens that, ahem, Fawzia decided to start going around putting on a stripey headdress and signing autographs of tourists who said they’d loved her in Dawson’s Anthony and Cleopatra? Oh, don’t exaggerate, Dab. Yes, obviously it was a time where the fascination with our ancient history started to influence our latter-day culture and identity. Finally being able to read those ancient records, as the Iraqis and Persians already had for decades, to bring vanished eras of history to life?[22] But that doesn’t mean we’d all become a bunch of interthesps as you clearly mean. (Mutters under breath) And for the record, it’s called a nemes, not a ‘stripey headdress’. Well, it didn’t go well down in Araby, let me tell you. All sorts of rumours that you had started bowing down to statues of Ra and Horus, practising idolatry, turning your backs on Islam... Some of us had never been Muslims to start with, Dab. Well, that’s not the point. And with a Sultan who was still young and experienced, the caliphal authority was weakened. Every angry mullah could stir up a group of equally angry young men. To torch a few Javanese homes, yes, but... Not by this point. Oh, sometimes, I suppose, but by this point the Javanese were angry right alongside us. Muslim brothers. Well...you’re being quiet, Saliha. I was just practising the Societist Doctrine of the Last Throw; waiting for you two to kill each other so I could win the argument. (Audience laughter and a few ‘ooh’s) But some of what Daburah said was felt in Aintab and the other scraps of free Turkish land too. There were a lot of rumours that Egypt was not only drifting away from Islam, but that you were all, well, having parties and growing rich while we struggled on the frontiers. There were raids back and forth over the border with Kurdistan, and nobody quite agreed whether it was independent, Russian or Persian...no legal recourse. A lot of people chose to leave, if they could. It’s around this time that so many Turks fled, either from my land, from the Salient or out from under Societist rule in the Eternal State, and went overseas. Especially to California. Where you all seem to have become involved in the film industry.[23] That’s a stereotype...but there is a grain of truth to it. Certainly, it was felt it was the only way to become prosperous and safe. That or go into business in Pérousie or somewhere. The wealth in Egypt didn’t reach us. It’s true the 1940s were a time of prosperity in Egypt, or at least in the big cities like Alexandria. Just like a lot of places in the world. And I know the shift to the Gold Standard wasn’t, ah, universally popular... You can say that again. There were lots of factors behind the rebellion when it finally came. Stories of Arabs facing persecution and discrimination in Egypt.[24] The Iraqis were worried that they would be the front line of another war with Persia, and Russia. The tax regime being reformed. Always the money. But yes, I get it. I do. I do regret what happened. Even though part of me is happy that Egypt is Egypt, and not just one part of a wider empire, even if the richest and most powerful part. Poor you. No, sorry, that was unworthy. I know you and your people have had your own troubles. Thank you. Well, there was unrest long before the revolt began in earnest. You mentioned Yemen, well, the same applied to the Persian kleinkriegers blowing up Russian occupiers and then high-tailing it over the border to Iraq. I know things were never the same after Hoseyin Pasha died in that drome crash in 1946. I know a lot of Arabs had seen him as the last hope— It’s not as simple as that. Hoseyin Pasha wasn’t really an Arab – well, he was a Levantine Arab, Syrian. He was married to a Jewess. ...and what’s wrong with that? Uh, nothing, Saliha, I just mean, he wasn’t seen as one of us. But his policies were still popular, right? The tax reform? He was seen as a defender of the Arabs? Including the Peninsular Arabs, I mean. All right, yes, I just think it’s an exaggerated point. All that stuff about everyone supposedly thinking he was murdered by the establishment, or the Societists or someone. Look, we all knew how unreliable dromes still could be in the 1940s, we weren’t stupid. It wasn’t about Egypt allegedly offing Hoseyin Pasha. It was about the idea that Egypt was so consumed with its parties and its high living that it never bothered to think about us and our needs enough to imagine it would need to off Hoseyin Pasha. I mean...you were partly right. It is true that there was an embrace of ancient Egyptian fashion and culture by some – like our version of the Archie subculture in some other countries. Alexandria, and Cairo and some other cities, had thriving cultural scenes and the same kind of prosperity that the so-called Naughty Forties is associated with here in America, or in Europe or China. Giza expanded enormously as the tourist trade was built around the pyramids and the tombs of the ancient kings. Half the plays and operas were about Hatshepsut or Taharqa. Maybe your people were barely exaggerating to say we were worshipping them. Or we were worshipping the mammon they got us from the tourists. I didn’t mean... We still idolise that period now, really. So do a lot of foreigners. A time of historical epic films being made there, of glamorous leading ladies smoking hookahs while men dressed as centurions gamble away their savings at the casino. Where mysterious spies and exotic detectives intrude from the world of fiction into that of fact. It does sound intoxicating. That’s the word, probably. There was still strife. Struggle around the Moon Lakes, pushing the Societists out of Darfur. Initially there was suspicion of the ASN; nobody trusted the French and the Abyssinians were a bit suspect, too. But in time we would be one of the most important members. We had the grand cause of opposing Societism. Anything, really, to stop us thinking about the poor of Araby, the Javanese refugees, the borderlands with Russia in Iraq and the Levant, those who would be in the firing line when the golden age came to an end. When you put it that way. I know we still have strife today. That arrangement in the Levant after all the fighting and disputes is...not universally popular. When I think about all that was unleashed, well, despite all our problems in that era before them, I can see why you’d see it as a golden age. One whose end you would mourn. Exactly. And come to an end it did. In 1957... * (Lt Black’s note) We will leave it there, lest we intrude into an era we have not yet adequately prepared the ground for. Next time, I’m bowing out, as apparently we need to hear about the world of physics... [1] Augusta University is the institution that was founded in Lexington, Virginia both OTL and TTL in 1749 as Augusta Academy. In OTL it eventually became Washington and Lee University. [2] The usual metonym for the theatre district in New York City in TTL, as opposed to Broadway in OTL. [3] ‘Kuwait’ is normally still given with Portuguese-influenced spelling in English in TTL, even though it hasn’t been Portuguese for a long time. [4] I.e. Gaziantep. [5] These terms became remarkably confused in OTL. The Western distinction between Near East and Far East ultimately descends from the Greek geographer Ptolemy’s dividing line of the Ganges river; the Far East was ‘India beyond the Ganges’ to Ptolemy, the Near East was everything between the Ganges and Europe. In OTL they became applied increasingly specifically to smaller areas, and then the term ‘Middle East’ arose in the nineteenth century and, confusingly, was treated as synonymous to ‘Near East’ and eventually displaced it. In TTL, ‘Near East’ has come to mean Anatolia, the Levant and sometimes Egypt; ‘Middle East’ means the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq and Iran, and ‘Far East’ (like OTL) means China and its neighbours – thus cutting the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia/Indochina out of the scheme altogether. This somewhat artificial distinction has had the historiographic effect of implying more of a cultural separation between the Levant and Arabia or Iraq than, perhaps, actually exists. [6] See Parts #85 and #99 in Volume II. [7] See Part #102 in Volume III. ‘Rumelia’ here is usually used to mean all of ‘Turkey-in-Europe’ or the Ottoman Balkans. [8] See Parts #108, #113 and #116 in Volume III. [9] See Parts #168 in Volume IV and #207 in Volume V. [10] The Pomaks are a Balkan demographic descended from Bulgarians who converted to Islam over the course of Ottoman rule. In OTL they have sometimes become persecuted, and the term Pomak is sometimes now considered offensive. The distinction made here is that Hafiz Mustafa (not his birth name) was raised an Orthodox Christian and converted to Islam in adulthood for reasons of political ambition, rather than being descended from Bulgarians who had converted much earlier and on a larger scale. [11] I.e. the Yuchyu Meclis or triple assembly – see the introduction to Part #238 in Volume VI. [12] In OTL the first Ottoman play (by the European definition) was performed in 1860. It is thought that the first opera was performed at the Topkapi Palace in 1797, but public performances (initially of Italian operas translated into Ottoman Turkish) began in 1840. Operas and operettas by Ottoman writers also began to be performed from the 1870s. In OTL the arts in the Ottoman Empire suffered from the endemic border conflicts and internal political strife over reform from the late 1870s onwards. This is largely avoided in TTL, allowing a longer-lasting cultural flowering. [13] Souan is the Coptic form of the name Aswan in Arabic. [14] See Parts #241, #242 and #247 in Volume VI. [15] From 1704, Ottoman Iraq was ruled over by semi-autonomous Mamluks (not to be confused with the specific Egyptian rulers with which the term Mamluk or Mameluke is usually associated); Mamluks were freed slaves who had converted to Islam and then been trained for administration. The Mamluks who ruled Iraq were of Georgian and Circassian descent. In OTL, Mamluk Iraq lasted from 1704 to 1831 when the Ottomans reimposed direct rule from Constantinople. In TTL, that state of affairs lasted for almost a century longer, though in practice the Devrim reforms had already de facto centralised much of the actual political power and the Ottomans left the Mamluks in place more as a symbolic gesture towards special status for the militarised border region of Iraq. [16] See Part #255 in Volume VII. [17] See Part #268 in Volume VII. [18] See Part #281 in Volume VIII. [19] See Part #286 in Volume VIII. The Russian breakthrough was also born of sheer Russian luck and Ottoman incompetence as well as just Belosselsky’s proactive approach to plague control keeping his army fighting fit against weaker opponents. [20] Compare the OTL Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh in an adjacent mountainous region, which remained static for 26 years between 1994 and 2020 before shooting war erupted again. [21] See Part #296 in Volume VIII. [22] Recall that as the Rosetta Stone was never discovered, in TTL hieroglyphs were not deciphered until the twenty-first century, so the Egyptomania craze is delayed (and largely replaced with an earlier fascination with Babylonia/Sumer instead). [23] The (stereotypical) role of Turks in the Californian film industry in TTL can be somewhat compared to that of Armenians in OTL – though obviously it’s not as simple as that, and TTL has many Armenians in cinema just as OTL has many Turks. Note that the film classic Scheherazade mentioned in the introduction, based on a work of Arab literature, had people with Turkish names both as the leading lady and in the director’s chair. [24] The elephant in the room to a viewer from OTL is that, in TTL, Egyptians generally do not consider themselves Arab. The identification of Egypt with pan-Arabism in OTL is mostly a twentieth century phenomenon (although this a complex and contentious subject). Even many experts on Egypt in foreign offices around the world were surprised and confused when Egypt began to embrace a pan-Arab identity in the 1930s and especially the 1950s with Nasserism. The difference is partly due to historical factors; in OTL Egypt and states across the Middle East shared a common hostility to colonialism (which can be argued to go back to Napoleon) and later to the existence of Israel, promoting a shared identity. In TTL, by contrast, Egypt is still seen as a distinct part of the Ottoman Empire, was the central authority of the ‘Alexandrine’ imperial remnant, and is embracing its newly-rediscovered ancient history and identity at a crucial time. Egypt in TTL still mostly speaks Arabic, of course, but TTL’s Egypt has a vested interest in emphasising the significant differences between Egyptian and Levantine or Peninsular Arabic (as they are known in OTL). By contrast, Egyptian media by 2020 TTL has largely swamped the other North African varieties of Arabic (especially in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica a.k.a. Libya) and replaced it with a standardised Egyptian form. There are still people in 2020 Egypt who consider themselves Arabs, but they are treated as a minority, and one outnumbered by the Coptic Christians (‘Copt’ alone does not imply Christian in the same way it does in OTL).\\"","output":"This chapter of \\"Look to the West\\" is a detailed exposition on the Middle East, specifically the Ottoman Empire and its successor states, in an alternate history setting. The chapter is presented as a recorded lecture by three women of different ethnic and religious backgrounds—Doctrix Tsanna Iskandar (an Egyptian Christian), Daburah al-Tamimi (a Sunni Muslim from the Arabian Desert), and Saliha Halayik (a Sunni Muslim Turk)—who examine the complex history of the Ottoman Empire and its lasting impact on the region. The lecture begins with a historical overview of the Ottoman Empire, emphasizing its longevity and the diversity of peoples and religions within it. The empire is described as conflictingly traditional and progressive, struggling with concepts of nationality, citizenship, and slavery in ways that foreigners often misconstrued. Despite expectations of the empire's decline, periods of reform and expansion followed, particularly under influential leaders such as Damat Melek Pasha and Abdul Hadi Pasha. By the late 1800s, the empire began to fracture internally, leading to a civil war known as the Time of Troubles, and the subsequent division of Ottoman territories into different power blocs. Major conflicts, including the Pandoric War and the Trebizond Disaster, are mentioned as pivotal moments of turmoil and loss for the empire. The early 1900s introduced further reforms, cultural growth, and a brief golden age before the devastating impact of a significant war and a plague. The lecture continues with an exploration of the Black Twenties, when the death of a Valide Sultan and a series of rebellions resulted in the fragmentation of the empire. The political turmoil was exacerbated by increased religious tensions, technological mishaps, and international interests. Eventually, these events culminate in the formation of new, smaller states, each grappling with its own internal and external challenges. Despite periods of prosperity, such as in Egypt during the 1940s, pervasive issues like poverty, discrimination, and strife remained unresolved. Ultimately, the discussion hints at an end to the golden era amidst growing nationalism and socio-political unrest, setting the stage for more upheaval and change in the region. The chapter concludes with a footnote from the contemporary perspective of Lt. Black, suggesting that the next discussion will venture into the world of physics, signifying a shift from political to scientific discourse."},{"instruction":"Summarize this chapter: \\"Part #318: Beneath the Raptor’s Wings REAL MANHATTAN PITTSA!

I don’t care what that flyer Bob found says, trying to find decent pizza here is harder than escaping from the ESD back in London was...and I want to know why! * Extract from recorded lecture on “The Golden Age of Ratiocinic Fiction” by Will Barclay, recorded October 19th, 2020— If there is any genre of literature which has consistently captured the imagination of the public in every nation since its inception, it is that which I have chosen to devote my own career to – that of ratiocinic fiction. This continuing appeal has stymied and upset literary critics ever since Peter Fitzhugh published The Melting Pot in 1885.[1] I’m not going to get into whether The Melting Pot was truly ‘the first’ ratiocinic story, or whether it counts as fiction as it’s based on a true investigation…we will leave that question for the pedants and their letter pages on Motext. (Audience chuckles) Yes, we all know about Chinese gong’an fiction these days. It’s probably true to say the basic concept of the ratiocinic challenge to the reader has been there ever since one of our Antediluvian ancestors hit another on the head with a rock and blamed it on a sword-toothed tiger (More chuckles) but Fitzhugh certainly codified the tropes and, dare I say it, ‘rules’ of the genre. Yes, how the critics have hated us. I won’t read out any of my rejection letters or poor reviews. Besides, I dealt with their writers in the most mature and appropriate way possible; I murdered them. (More audience laughter) Well, that is to say, I wouldn’t examine the names of some of the victims that Dale Vaughn investigates too closely…but it’s not just me. Partly it’s the usual snobbery aimed at any form of literary exercise that is popular with those whom the critics see as riff-raff and beneath their notice, and in their ideal society wouldn’t be literate at all, leaving the written word to only its appointed high priests. (Murmurs) As you may gather, I feel strongly about this. Nor are we ratiocinic fiction writers alone. Look at the pulp sequents of the masked adventurers, and more recently the films based upon them, which we are confidently told is the downfall of our civilisation. Or the love-fantasy tales sneered at as repetitive and unrealistic. I could go on, but for once, I’m not being paid by the word. (Chuckles) The critics try to give justifications for their arrogant dismissal of the ratiocinic genre. They opine that our fascination with ratiocinic stories, in all their forms, represent an atavistic and uncouth fascination with violence and evil. They point to the recurrent driving plot thread of murder that runs throughout our tales, admittedly to an unrealistic frequency – unless one’s setting is the street outside the Star and Rattlesnake just after the Philly Stags have won the Championship. (Audience chuckles) They claim that we writers, and our readers, represent nothing more than a modern, suppressed expression of the bloodthirsty tendency of our ancestors to cheer on public executions and bid for pieces of the bloodstained rope. Perhaps so, and there are certainly stories which glory in blood and gore, as there always have been, back to the days of Gilgamesh. But how, then, do they explain the vast swathes of the ratiocinic genre that seem to shy away from depicting the very violence whose expression they use as their driving plot thread? What of the stories in which the dead body is the result of a subtle poisoning in a country home, in which every family member seems to have a motive? Those same critics may speak contradictively out of the other side of their mouth and call us out of touch with reality. They miss the point. We are not fond of murder as a plot point because we consider murder some delightful subject, as they contend. At most, we might argue that we are merely expressing a ‘what-if’ moment, that most people have threatened to kill a family member or friend in the heat of the moment, meaning nothing by it, and to ponder the consequences if they really carried through with such a threat. But really, murder is popular among ratiocinic writers simply because it represents the ultimate, heinous crime whose perpetrator is justified, in his or her own mind, in any action to conceal their guilt. A man who steals, whether it be a loaf of bread in the street or a million imps from a pension fund, must at some point make a judgement of whether it is best to continue a futile attempt to escape the police or to simply submit. And our story comes to a premature end, as it does with other lesser crimes. Conversely, for the murderer the only possible legal fate is life imprisonment or, historically, the rope. He will do anything to escape that fate. Importantly, it also locks him into a decaying path of descent. Morally, his first crime may be as justifiable as any crime can be; the slaying of a blackmailer who tormented him or a rival who implicated his innocent self in some other crime, perhaps. And yet we see again and again, in fiction and reality, the superficially ‘good’ man who is soon killing again and again in a desperate and futile attempt to cover up his original crime, all thought of morality forgotten. When the first murder is committed, something breaks inside our moral compass, and though on the outside we may look unchanged, inside we are no longer completely human. (Audience murmurs) I know that sort of sentiment can sound evocative of Societism, but it is very much also the justification of law and order in the nations, and the rules that underpin our civilisation. Furthermore, in any other crime the victim is a witness, unless one adopts increasingly contrived plot devices such as having him conveniently sunk in a coma for the duration of the case. A murder victim is the purest expression of a mystery. We might not even know whom he is, or where he came from. Perhaps the body is found in an unexpected place. A packing case in the Lost Property at Empire Station, for example. Yes, sadly, that was based on a real case. (Murmurs) Maybe the body has all identifying marks carefully removed, and our forensic expert must astonish the police by identifying the victim regardless. Or our patient, plodding police detective may find the killer by sheer volume of work, eliminating all possibilities until only the truth remains. Or our hard-bitten rubbersole private investigator might begin a series of unlikely but exciting encounters with the gang secretly behind the killing.[2] As you can see, the storytelling possibilities are endless. Finally, of course, ratiocinic fiction is unique – or at least it was, until some recent experiments in other genres – in that it is interactive. The reader is not merely experiencing a story, but pitting their wits against the author, trying to solve the mystery before the detective can. The best writers are those who make the reader think they have solved it, offer some parts which the reader was indeed correct about, but then pull the rug out from under them and reveal a twist – without, and this is crucial, that twist seeming unrealistic or pulled out of nowhere. If my readers are kicking themselves afterwards and cursing that they missed that clue on page 79, rather than calling me a hack who just makes stuff up as he goes along, I reckon I’ve done my job right. (Audience chuckles) But enough about me and Dale Vaughn. I’m here to talk about the Golden Age of Ratiocinic Fiction, that is to say, the Third Wave, which was a long one and took place in the Second Interbellum between the Black Twenties and the Sunrise War, the Electric Circus age as some call it. A brief note on the terminology. The First Wave was, of course, that one kickstarted by The Melting Pot, where we got the birth of many of our most iconic and celebrated detectives. Carlo Matteucci, obviously; Dujardin, Macavity, Astrid Hjelje, Harris, López, and, of course, Always Wright. Mary Hill, Mary Bower as she became, wasn’t just one of the first big female writers of ratiocinic stories, important a claim to fame though that is. With the Always Wright stories, she was the first to introduce the world to the potential that New York City had as a setting for those mysteries. New York had always had a night watch system since it was founded as New Amsterdam way back in 1625. Almost two centuries later, in 1815, the Common Council created the Amsterdam and Long Island Provincial Police. This force was heavily controlled by the Patriot Tammanite secret society and often recruited from the new German immigrant communities following the Jacobin Wars, helping to control elections and suppress rivals. Sorry if I sound dry, copied this bit out of the encyclopaedia. (Audience chuckles) It was important for our history, as the Supremacist Party grew out of anger with this corrupt situation.[3] After Howden terrorists attacked the city in the Manhattan Massacre of 1851,[4] public anger and an ensuing inquiry eventually led to the reform of the police force. The modern New York Metropolitan Police were created in 1860 after the city was first allowed to expand to encompass the surrounding boroughs, and its remit has gradually increased over time. The reason why I mention this is that as the NYMP grew less corrupt and more focused on keeping the peace, not merely protecting the interests of the powers that be, a gap in the market opened up. New York was one of the first cities where private investigators, or ’gators in common parlance, became a widespread and well-known phenomenon. Wheres the police would only go so far, gators would patiently work to retrieve kidnapped loved ones, prove the adultery of estranged spouses, and find stolen jewels – providing their pay was maintained, of course. Naturally, the police were not very happy about the presence of gators, but their popularity with certain parts of the upper classes meant that they survived, and a licensing system was introduced in 1879. Always Wright, or Jonas Wright to give him his proper name, wasn’t the first New York rubbersole in fiction, but Mary Hill made him a nationwide, a worldwide, phenomenon. That was the First Wave of ratiocinic fiction, cut short, of course, by the Pandoric War. The Second Wave took place in the First Interbellum – confused yet? (Audience laughter) There are plenty of revisionists today who’ll defend the Second Wave, and more power to them, but I go with the consensus that it doesn’t hold a candle to the Third or First. Too many gimmicky and derivative authors, reinventing the wheel with a new spin on it. You get stuff like A. P. Wellman’s The Quister Detective from 1909, all about an investigator who never leaves his home and solves all his crimes on the quister through mental logic alone. Fine, until you realise it’s the exact same plot as Françoise Bouvard’s The Gentleman in the Tavern from 1892, just with the quister gimmick instead of a narrator verbally bringing the clues to him. The Second Wave is full of that stuff. The best thing you can say about it is that it did start to broaden the kinds of detective we saw. In the First Wave you could set a story in China, but it was written by a Scotsman and your protagonist had to be a white outsider like Macavity. In the Second Wave we did get things like like Xu Chunxian’s Judge Bao period stories, a modern reimagining of the old Chinese gong’an genre I mentioned. To be honest, I do not find Xu’s prose very compelling – maybe it’s just the translation – but those sorts of works were an important ‘first’. Others in a similar category include Basavourage Patille’s Les nuits maisuriennes series and Belle Yorke’s Adventures of Jagun Kwaku.[5] There are many others I could mention, but we must move on to the Third Wave. The Third Wave is called the Golden Age for a reason. It’s when writers really began to refine their craft, taking the best ideas from the earlier waves whilst quietly dropping or deconstructing the more questionable ones. Generally, if you’ve heard of a ratiocinic author or series from before the 1970s, it’ll be either one of the biggest names from the First Wave or, more probably, a Third Wave example. Even though there had been plenty of Matteucci copycats in the First Wave, it was the Third Wave that saw a real increase in the volume of ratiocinic fiction. As always, we remember the good examples – and even then, there are some forgotten gems – but forget the large quantity of derivative dross published at the time. Memory is like a sundial; it measures only the sunlit hours. You’re probably expecting me to start with Jeanette Quentin. (Small reaction from audience) Well, there is a reason why Madame Quentin is rightly known as La reine du crime in French-speaking lands. Even in days when translations were considered inherently suspicious, readers here and around the world have continued to devour her books. Her best known stories are those involving the retired Irish chief of police, Ruairí Ó Caoimh, the man with the carrotty-red hair whose name no-one in France can either spell or pronounce – which unfortunately included Quentin’s publishers (Audience laughter) – and whose genial sagacity is shattered only when someone mistakes him for an Englishman, as they invariably do. Ó Caoimh, or O’Keeffe if I can anglicise it without being burned at the stake, was a very versatile vehicle for Quentin. He began literary life in 1930 with sensationalist plots concerning unfinished business from the recent war. However, Quentin soon hit her stride with mysteries set in anonymous, superficially peaceful rural French villages, where the locals were at each others’ throats behind the scenes and O’Keeffe’s retirement is interrupted as he must solve the latest murder. But Quentin was also able to space out these tales, and reinvent the character, by adding flashback cases from Quentin’s days on the force in Ireland, along with overseas visits to Bisnaga and Pérousie. Yes, I could spend a long time talking about O’Keeffe and Quentin’s other, lesser-known, detective protagonists. Or indeed about the many authors who copied her formula, some of whom managed to graduate to more original creations of their own. But I’m a New Yorker who writes New York mysteries, mysteries that, I will freely acknowledge, owe a lot to those who have come before me. I’ve already talked about Mary Hill and her detective Always Wright creating the first New York of the mystery novel. But, as you probably know, their trailblazing efforts merely paved the way for the man whom I consider to be the greatest ratiocinic author of all time: Edward ‘Slim’ Havemeyer. When Slim Havemeyer turned forty in 1930, no-one would have guessed that he’d be the next big thing in ratiocinic fiction. He was a banker, and a successful one, who had built himself up from humble roots to the point that he could choose to retire early with a sizeable fortune.[6] His brother Peter was a journalist, and Edward had begun writing himself when Peter needed a few additional items for features pages which he maintained. Biographers aren’t quite sure how he made the leap from this to pursuing fiction as a retirement hobby, but he did. Ratiocinic fiction wasn’t his first choice of genre, and The Kitchen Knife wasn’t even his first ratiocinic story – but it was the one that caught the public eye and took the bookshops by storm. Going back to read The Kitchen Knife today is invariably a different experience to that which those first readers had back in 1931. As far as those readers were concerned, Havemeyer’s protagonist was the rubbersole detective Harold Archer, a hardbitten former NYMP copper and private investigator who’s trying to get to the bottom of the mysterious murder of the owner of Rosetti’s restaurant. In the course of his investigation, Archer is intrigued by the contributions of Marco Barone (slight reaction from audience), a chef formerly employed by the dead man. Barone rapidly proves to have a lot more depth of intelligence than initial impressions suggested, and Archer – and the reader – oscillates back and forth between hanging on his words of insight about the case, and suspecting Barone himself of being the killer. (Another audience reaction) Exactly. You know and I know that Marco Barone is the real hero of Havemeyer’s stories and Archer is merely his narrative amanuensis, a way for us to be astonished right along with him rather than being able to see into Barone’s head. But back when that first book came out, everyone was kept guessing right up to the last pages. Havemeyer was promptly commissioned to write a sequel, and then a series. Initially, he was carefully mysterious about Barone’s past and just why had found himself in New York, then hardly a city with many Italian immigrants. Maybe this was a deliberate tactic to string out readers’ curiosity and Havemeyer had always planned out the answer, but I strongly suspect he didn’t know himself at the time. No; the Barone series was always popular, but what turned it into a real American classic was six books in and the publication of Belteshazzar in 1944… * Extract from recorded lecture on “The Romulan Enigma” by Dx Giulia Scerra and Anthony Strachan, recorded October 24th, 2020— In 1926, for most Americans Italy was an unknown.[7] Even though these continents of the Novamund were discovered by an Italian, that has rarely been a part of the, ah, historical narrative taught in schools here.[8] It is not true, of course, to say that there were no Italians in the Empire before 1926, that would be a foolish lie of propagandists, yet it is frequently repeated! We have always been a part of the American story, but our voices became louder and more numerous after 1926, and there will always be some who find that threatening. I assure you that, no matter what certain films may have given you the impression of, I am not a member of the Camorra.[9] (Slightly uncertain audience laughter) Thank you, Doctrix Scerra, I assure you, nobody was thinking that… (Coughs) Exaggerated though that claim may be, it is true to say that the vast majority of Americans in 1926 had never met or seen an Italian, except perhaps in newspaper asimcons or in films at the odeon. Italy was an exotic place on the far side of the world. People in Drakesland, for instance, were more likely to have met a Yapontsi than an Italian. (Audience murmurs) Italy was a cobelligerent of the Empire in the Black Twenties, and we dutifully hung up her flag alongside ours as we celebrated the victories of her rocket missiles against the Russians. (More murmurs) But we knew very little about the country. But all of that changed in 1926. The Romulan takeover of Italy is not well understood outside the country, you understand. Precious few inside the country even know, and there is a reticence to ask our grandparents who remember the last years of the regime. Every family has someone whom they suspect of working for the Consulate. And so, ai, even in death, Veraldi and his foul sons continue to strangle our freedom. Yes, yes, Doctrix. Part of what is not understood, as you correctly say, is what the Romulan regime was actually like. It has been called ‘the first modern dictatorship’ by Antoine Pasquier, who says it was the template for more familiar dictatorial states like Panchala, bringing the ideas of men like Lisieux (Audience murmur) into the modern age. Using technology and communications to realise the idea of the personality cult to a level that, yes, Lisieux could never have dreamed. Sì, sì. I do not entirely agree with Professor Pasquier’s view… No, nor do I, I was just say— There is some truth to the idea that Ram Kumar and the like copied some ideas from the Romulans, yes. But the Romulans were different. They were— I was just about to get to that, Doctrix, yes. (Coughs) There is a simple but radical thesis that unlocks the secrets of the Romulans. Put simply, they were National Societists. (Audience reaction) Sì. ‘Societism in one country’, you might put it. And I would say, aha, that is una contraddizione assurda, no? How can one have Societism in one country when Societism is all about trying to destroy the boundaries between countries and deny their existence? It is true, on the face of it, it makes no sense. But how many self-contradictory ideologies have we seen attempts to enact in the real world? No, in my view Romulanism – if such a term can be said to exist – was influenced by the Combine, and especially by Italy’s neighbour Danubia. To the later Romulans, it was not about trying to unite the world under the black flag. But it was about the romantic revival of Roman institutions— Or what they thought were Roman institutions. —yes – and promoting the Roman idea that anyone, regardless of their birth, could become a Roman citizen. Providing they spoke Latin and adopted Roman culture, of course. Yes. But one could argue that the Romulans were simply more honest Societists, especially the kind of Combine Societists we had before the Silent Revolution, when they were often pushing a slightly modified version of Platinean culture on the Nusantara or Africa. The Romulans wanted to rebuild the Roman Empire, not necessarily by literally reconquering the Mediterranean— Though some did. —yes – but by recreating the idea of Roman citizenship. Along with some other ideas like the legion of the proletariat under arms… But this brings us to an important point. You did say ‘later’ Romulans, and you asked whether Romulanism can be said to exist as a concept. That is right. In the beginning, in 1926, things were quite different. Yes…why don’t you go into more detail, Doctrix. (Sound of gulping glass of water) Grazie. In 1926 there was an organisation called the Legion of Romulus, made up primarily of angry wounded veterans and bereaved family members. They felt that Antonio Orsini’s government has called upon Italians to fight on in the misery of the Polish front throughout the plague years, that Italian ingenuity has delivered the war-winning wonder weapon that had finally broken the Russian lines, and that now Italy was being betrayed by France and her allies. (Audience murmurs) I do not say that there was not some justice to some of their claims. It was clear that Italy would be cheated of any significant gains for her years of blood, sweat and tears. And the people were angry. It remains a very contentious subject in Italy today whether the Legion of Romulus was funded by the Russians behind the scenes. Perhaps not at first, but later on… Sì. The people demanded reforms. It was not merely la Legione at that time, but many groups, including the mainstream cobrist Alliance Party. It was a wave of anger, blaming, how do you say, the establishment for the betrayal of the courage and perseverance of the Italian people. For the first time, we felt like one people, not four states – made of many more historical states – smashed together by the whims of happenstance. Formerly, only the King had united us, but now we had united ourselves through our anger. We demanded universal suffrage and for a single national parliament, not merely ministers selected from the four national ones. And we got our way. Yes. But the Legion, under its early figurehead Colonel Malpezzi, found itself in the electride light by a strong propaganda campaign. It could appeal to many of the new voters you mentioned, Doctrix. Malpezzi might be an officer, but with his pinned-up sleeve and eyepatch he was every family’s wounded husband, son, comrade. Yes, yes, and he, or his shadowy backers and lieutenants who really ran the Legion, they had a simple, how do you say, prescrizione, prescription, to tackle Italy’s woes. Embrace the spirit of Romulus, of new beginnings. As Romulus slew Remus, ruthlessly turn on the French before they could betray Italy. They even demanded part of Provence be handed over at one point— Yes, they were not realistic, some of them. But that might have been only for internal consumption. As I was saying, a simple – prescription. Turf out the aristocrats who, they said, had had their feet up while our people had suffered and died in war and plague. Turn on the leeches who had profited from our misery. That was sometimes— Yes, it was sometimes a, ah, eufemismo for the Jews or other undesirables, I am sorry to say. A big, simple message that pointed the finger of blame elsewhere. The people, enough of them, embraced it, and at the election… I should say that the Legion of Romulus was never actually the name of the political party, though the two are often confused by people outside Italy. No, you are right. The political wing of the Legion was the, ah, Partito d’azione, the Action Party. That is a core part of what you called Romulanism, the, ah, fetish of action. Doing something is always better than doing nothing. A simple, dangerous message, uncomfortably close to Jacobinism, but one which the public lapped up after years of misery and stagnation in their political classes. Yes. Though even we often treat the Legion and the Action Party as, ah, synonymous, the fact that they were distinct helped the party’s appeal early on. The Legion was something from everyday life, not an, uh, ivory tower of politicians isolated from the real world. If they suggested you should vote for the Action Party, that meant more to these new voters than politicians appealing directly. Even though it was often the same people with two different hats. Yes. The Action Party didn’t win a majority in 1926, but together with the Alliance Party… Yes. The Frenchwoman, Signora Mercier, she guessed from the start that the Alliance Party would only be, ah, useful idiots for the Action Party. She was right. The fools thought that they could control them. That skilled, experienced politicians like themselves could run rings around the Action Party. They soon realised their mistake. They were sidelined, and in 1928 Salvo Parrini died under – ah – questionable circumstances. The, er, finding of his body in such a way helped discredit the Alliance further and the Action Party were able to assimilate large chunks of its former supporters. Yes. By 1931, the Action Party had gained sufficient dominance that they were able to influence substantial chunks of the electoral process, and gained a majority in their own right. But we shouldn’t forget that the Romulans were genuinely popular with some people, especially early on. No, no, it is true. Their cult of centralisation, when every Italian was used to the idea that things worked differently in the next town, the next valley. The war on corruption and crime. In time they fell victim to it themselves, of course, but in the short term. Yes. The investment in railways and roadways, the financing schemes that allowed people to purchase houses and mobiles in instalments…perhaps another sign of copying from the Societist playbook. There were also reasons to oppose them, beyond their brutality and lack of respect for free and fair elections. Many people disliked their pushing of a Roman-focused curriculum in schools and their censorship of film, newspapers and Photel. They were also conspicuously wasting money on rocket experiments that did not go anywhere, at least for the first couple of decades. And, of course, there was the Tunis War. But that is to get ahead of ourselves. True, but it began early on. It was an easy territorial win, when it had looked as though Orsini’s government would leave Italy with less territory than she started the Anni neri with. King Carlo had shut down Veraldi’s attempts to send troops to assist the republicans in Spain, so he moved on to another target. Some, especially in Naples where the Romulans had lower levels of support, were still bitter about Tunis having broken away in 1869 and then joined the Ottoman Empire. But now the Ottoman Empire was split in two and the Moroccans had already laid claim to Algiers. In 1929 the first Italian troops secured the city of Tunis, then over the next two years the whole of the old colony was reclaimed. We were left with vague desert borders with Moroccan Algiers and Alexandrine Tripolitania. For the next thirty years, every time the government wanted to distract from some problem at home, they would simply whip up a border conflict with one or the other nation and conscript another generation of young men to send to the front. There was never any actual goal or intention behind it. It was simply a way to control the political narrative. Yes, and so this party that was founded by angry wounded veterans ensured that there would be a never-ending supply of angry wounded veterans in the future. (Audience reaction) I am not entirely joking, as some of the Romulans had the ideological belief that a generation untested by war would be a soft, decadent and failing one. Almost the opposite of Societism in that sense, a reaction against it. In other way, though, you were right. The obsession with Roman history, the teaching of Latin in schools…there are parallels. But as time went on and the structure of Romulan society, based on fear and conformity, became more embedded, it was sycophancy that got rewarded, not courage. Yes, I’ve heard it described as the Romulans having raced through Roman history like coffee-chugging athletes putting on a play depicting everything from Romulus to Romulus Augustulus. (A few slightly confused chuckles from the audience) Corruption set in early on, as you said. Only ten years after the Romulans took power, there was an attitude that it was merely enough to want to be like the Romans, and wishful thinking would do the rest. There was a halfhearted and piecemeal attitude towards plans and projects. Sì. With exceptions like the continuing rocketry programme. But yes. Look at 1936. The Greeks take advantage of the war between the two Ottoman splinters to try to retake their mainland, the Romulans promise support, and then it never materialises. Given the Russians were unable to get through Danubia to assist the Greeks and an Italian intervention alone would not have served Russian interests, the theory is that this proves that the Romulans were already dancing to Petrograd’s tune by this point. Perhaps. By 1942, the people were starting to chafe under Romulan rule. It had become clear to all that the elections were being rigged. The Shock of 1934 had not affected Italy much, but then – again, perhaps to serve Russian ends – the government supported the implementation of the Passau System and the Gold Standard. This disadvantaged Neapolitan agriculturalists in particular over the ensuing years, leading to a wave of immigration overseas… Yes, we’ll come back to that. You were talking about 1942. Scusa, yes. Relations with the monarchy had become strained. In 1940 the Romulans had wanted to try to invade Sicily, of all places, only to be shut down by the ailing King Carlo. Battle lines were being drawn. In 1942, the King died and Prince Giuseppe came to the throne. That vile Veraldi, who was starting to lose his own grip on the party, felt he had to do something to impress the angrier, younger men in the party and reassert the Romulans' grip on Italy. Behind closed doors, Giuseppe had been a vocal critic of the regime. Veraldi audaciously organised and launched, the following year, what was named – by the Romulans themselves – La rivoluzione lucreziana. The Lucretian Revolution, yes, named for the Rape of Lucretia which had led to the overthrow of the Roman monarchy in about 510 BC, though the history is half-legendary. I really cannot emphasise enough the point that the Romulans were – ah – today we might say interthesps.[10] (Audience laughter) No, I mean it. As we said, it was half wishful thinking to them. Playing at being Romans like children. Except real people got killed. Yes, yes they did. The Lucretian Revolution was far from bloodless. Veraldi accused the monarchy of being the sticking point that had held Italy back, blaming them for the fact that the Romulans had not been able to deliver all they had promised. King Giuseppe did have supporters, of course, but the climate of fear that Veraldi and the Romulans had created worked against them. No-one was sure if a family member would not betray them to the regime. Children had been indoctrinated by the Young Action groups promoting ‘traditional’ outdoors activities like building miniature Roman forts and walls. There and then, Veraldi seemed to have more power than the King himself, and in the alienistic moment, he was able to seize absolute power. The King fled into exile in France. If things had gone differently, he might have ended up as King of Pérousie rather than Francesco of Venice, perhaps? You will have your little joke – our King would never have abandoned us like that. Aydub. So now Romulan control over Italy looked absolute. Sì, Veraldi began the bizarre policies that the Romulans have become most infamous for. Other parties were banned and the Romulan eagle appeared on the national flag. A few years later, Party and national flags were the same. No distinction. Loyalty to the party, to the movement, was treated as synonymous with patriotism. Sì. They abolished Parliament and recreated the Roman Senate and Consuls – though Veraldi, and later Garavaglia of course – held the real power behind the symbolic figures. Elections actually became a little freer in one way, but they were organised on a strange modern recreation of the old tribal assemblies. Constituencies were no longer geographic, but were based on vocation, with a particular cult of the businessman.[11] Which is emblematic of later Romulanism, of course, and well-nigh contradictory to its origins, where the Romulans had railed against businessmen who had grown fat in the war while others had suffered and died. Exactly. This is why it is so hard to pin down what the Romulans actually believed or what ‘Romulanism’ is. Another example. They began as a Catholic-supremacist group, but after the Lucretian Revolution there were actual attempts to revive Roman paganism, as absurd as that sounds, and the Pope in Rome was put under pressure to endorse the regime. Jansenism abroad got another boost, as it had when the old Popes were under Spanish pressure to deny the existence of the UPSA. Increasingly, Papal pronouncements were seen as untrustworthy. But that’s another story. Veraldi died in 1949 and was succeeded by Garavaglia, one of the businessmen we were just discussing, as the real power behind the rotating consuls. A combination of the economic good times and the successful launch of Dedalo-1 a year later, which shocked and impressed the world, managed to keep the Romulans in control of Italy until the Crash of 1956. But as you were saying, many Italians voted with their feet and fled the country. Yes. Emigration was not entirely new to us, of course, but this was on another level. Neapolitans in particular were looking for economic opportunities elsewhere, but many others left too out of sheer fear of the regime and its ‘praetorian’ secret police. And, for the first time, especially after Washborough’s social reforms completing the de facto emancipation of Catholics, the Empire was a top destination for them.[12] Soon, Italians would no longer be a mysterious folk on the other side of the planet, especially for those who lived in New York City. The Bowery would soon be a place where the Italian languages were heard more than English – or German.[13] * Extract from recorded lecture on “The Golden Age of Ratiocinic Fiction” by Will Barclay, recorded October 19th, 2020— Now, Belteshazzar was timely. Slim Havemeyer wrote it rapidly and made some accurate, some might say cynical, guesses about where Manhattan society was headed. It debuted in 1944 just as the issues he had written about where coming to a head. The Italian King had just been overthrown and the Covenant System was in the news across the world, hinting that the Empire was a more favourable destination for Catholic immigrants than ever before. Havemeyer accurately predicted that the first groups of Italians arriving in the Bowery were only the crest of the wave, and began reshaping his Barrone-Archer novels accordingly. By the time Belteshazzar hit the shelves, the New York papers were full of stories – some true, some histrionically exaggerated – about the impact that hundreds, thousands of Italian immigrants were having on the Bowery and the city as a whole. Tensions were rising, and a powder keg of anti-immigration sentiment was about to blow. Into this situation stepped Havemeyer, like an army sapper ready to defuse a bomb. The title Belteshazzar has been confusing to readers and critics. In the 1940s, many people still associated names from the Book of Daniel with the Wragg family from Carolina. (Audience murmurs) But Havemeyer’s real meaning was an allusion to the idea that Italians entering the Empire were faced with the same choices of Daniel. The prophet had been given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar, risen to an important position in the Babylonian government, but then had been faced with demands that he set aside his faith in God to adopt Babylonian ways. How could the Italians square the circle of trying to assimilate with an, often hostile, American population without losing their culture, identity and core beliefs? In case some readers had not got the point, Havemeyer’s follow-up on similar themes would be titled By the Rivers of Babylon. I won’t go into too much detail about the plot of Belteshazzar, both because you should read it yourself and because, unfortunately, Photel, film and Motoscopy adaptations have proven so popular that you probably already know the twists. Suffice to say that they shocked the people of New York and beyond, and yes, perhaps Havemeyer – through Barone and Archer – made some of them rethink their prejudices about their new neighbours with their loud chatter, their hand movements and their popery. (Murmurs) I am quoting from a newspaper of the time, in case you were wondering. The plot of By the Rivers of Babylon underlines the point, featuring Barone having to unearth an ancestral crime from the early nineteenth century which is secretly at the root of a more recent one, despite Archer’s scepticism. The earlier crime involves a German family whose patriarch is now an important figure in New York business and politics, but at that time were poor immigrants like the same Italians the character is now railing against. The hypocrisy is so obvious that Barone never even needs to bring it up. Again, Havemeyer’s work was thought-provoking. Ratiocinic fiction is looked down on because it’s popular, but that very popularity means it has the opportunity to read a wider audience and change the world, as no pontificating treatise read by three chaps with monocles ever could. (Audience chuckles) Not everyone approved of Havemeyer’s message, of course. He received death threats and was un-invited from a number of prestigious New York social clubs, which he wore as a badge of honour; many of them have been forced to apologise, to him and the Italians, since his death. Most amusing, in a dark way, was the article in the Supremacist-supporting Manhattan Messenger which complained about the use of ‘politics’ in Havemeyer’s books, and why do detectives need to be Italian now? (Some uncertain laughs from audience) Well, exactly. Havemeyer himself wrote a rebuttal in the New York Register pointing out that the very first ratiocinic detective, Carlo Matteuci in The Melting Pot, was Italian! (More raucous audience laughter) And, of course, he had been based on a very real Italian detective in California, Aurelio Melloni, who had solved the Vixen’s Jewels case. It would be wrong to suggest that Havemeyer – or Barone – was the sole Central Character who brought about a shift in popular attitudes towards Italian immigrants. That was brought about by the tireless work of many individuals, both Italians and homegrown Americans, who fended off the scaremongering of the Supremacists (Audience murmurs) – yes, I’ll say it, and other groups. Those who combatted misinformation, and ensured that those genuine criminals among the honest majority were brought to justice and not allowed to blacken the name of the Italian diaspora as a whole. In that case, I think it is fair to attribute the popularisation that kind of nuance to Havemeyer’s books and their film adaptations. Barone fought many fictitious Italian villains, as I said, while also saving innocent Italians from being the victims of prejudice or being scapegoated for crimes they did not commit. There was a sea change in attitudes, especially in New York City itself. The fact that we can enjoy Manhattan pittsa, or should I say pizza (A few audience chuckles) today, we can owe in part to the writings of Havemeyer. No – despite some opposition from dunderheads, the real opinions of the people of New York about Havemeyer became clear in 1948, when he got into trouble over the novel The Poulter Heist. By this point, he had established the formula that would characterise the mid to late Barone-Archer novels. We would see everything from Archer’s point of view, but when inevitably stumped, he would go to Rosetti’s to see Barone, who by this point had graduated to the position of head chef and owner of the restaurant (helped by the fees from a few cases). Barone would make an expansive apology for being unable to leave his kitchen, of course, but would solve the case purely by giving Archer instructions and having him bring suspects and witnesses to dine in the restaurant where he could probe them with questions. By this point, the changing demographics of Manhattan were frequently referenced, with Barone often acting to defend the cause of poor Italians and refusing to charge them anything. Later on, Barone – whose ageing remarkably slowed down, as is common in such books – would also face a Camorra nemesis, Pietro Russo, who is trying to export his criminal organisation to New York. Barone is portrayed as having had run-ins with the Camorra in his mysterious past life, but his contempt for the Romulans is such that he admits to a little sympathy with Russo simply for being their opponent. Romulan Praetorian agents also occasionally appear as villains, usually as aniseed rags[14] to disguise the real perpetrator. A recurring element is Barone’s dismissal of the Praetorians when Archer suggests them, saying that no supporter of the Romulan regime has ‘an ounce of the brains’ needed to commit the crime in question. Needless to say, Havemeyer’s books were banned in Italy for years, and there is even evidence that the Romulans may have tried to have him assassinated. I digress – back to 1948. For The Poulter Heist, Havemeyer concocted a plot involving a seemingly-impossible robbery from the fictional Poulter’s Bank, which Barone, of course, has to solve. I would say it’s not one of Havemeyer’s best books, but it’s inevitably been adapted a lot just because of the controversy. Richmond Bank, which Havemeyer had worked for as a clerk, sued him, claiming he had based Poulter’s on itself and given away secrets of the security system used there. This was a fair accusation, frankly; Havemeyer was often careless in using things from his own life in the books without disguising them sufficiently. His own defence was a simple retort that he had worked as Richmond twenty years before, and if they had not updated their security system in that time, they had done themselves more damage by telling criminals how lax they were than he ever could. The police and the judicial system of the Confederation of New York, especially those based in New York City, were generally antagonistic to Havemeyer. The police were rarely portrayed very positively in the Barone-Archer books, and there were suspicions that Havemeyer had used thinly-disguised versions of real police investigators and judges in them. However, at the so-called ‘trial of the century’, the jury unanimously voted to acquit, much to the judge’s anger. Havemeyer, shy by nature, greeted a crowd of people protesting his indictment outside the Supreme Court of Judicature. He was signing books for so long that he joked it would have taken less time to do the prison sentence. It soon became clear that Richmond’s case had badly backfired, to the point that the bank’s own position was imperilled by Havemeyer-reading account holders withdrawing funds and closing their accounts in protest. The board had to request an emergency recapitalisation loan from the Confederal government in order to prevent a run on the bank. Though Richmond’s did survive until a merger in 1965, it never regained its former position in the hierarchy of New York banks. Furthermore, while the Barone-Archer books had already been popular across the Empire, the trial drew attention and ironically began to popularise them across the globe, as people wondered what all the fuss was about. Translations, many versions in those days before ASN authorisation, began to appear. And, of course, some leaked over the border into Romulan Italy. The great irony was that, while Italian-language versions were rare – there are many languages in Italy and there would be little incentive to sell them in any other country in Europe – the Romulans found them overwhelmed with various Latin and Latin-related language versions. Some had been aimed at Danubia, but others were for illicit smuggling into the UPSA; even the Societists enjoyed ratiocinic fiction, and some opined that the message of Havemeyer’s books was in line with their beliefs – which it wasn’t, of course! But the irony, as I said, was that few in Italy would have been able to read these if the Romulans had not invested so much money in teaching children Latin… [1] See Part #219 in Volume V. [2] ‘Rubbersole’, like ‘gumshoe’ in OTL, refers to private investigators wearing shoes with thick, near-silent rubber soles for surreptitiously tailing a suspect or infiltrating a place by night. [3] See Part #169 in Volume IV. The ‘Amsterdam and Long Island’ terminology reflects the fact that New York City’s municipal government did not yet cover all the areas the Patriots wanted the police to control, so the police were set up on a provincial basis. [4] See Part #192 in Volume IV. [5] Basouvarage Patille was a Bisnagi author (note the Frenchified spelling of the name, which would be Basavaraj Patil in OTL) and his stories are set in Mysore city (Maisur in French). Belle Yorke was a female Freedish author whose protagonist is a half-Ashanti, half-Freedish jagun (Company soldier) who ends up investigating crimes during his postings across Guinea. [6] Havemeyer is from the same Havemeyer (Hoevemeyer) family which emigrated to New York City in 1799 in OTL; in TTL, they have not been as successful (the OTL Havemeyers built a powerful sugar empire and became politically influential) but Barclay is slightly exaggerating how humble Edward Havemeyer’s background was. [7] Besides the differences in immigration discussed here, Italy’s nineteenth century profile in the ENA was lower than OTL’s USA because of the way Italy was united in TTL; there is no charismatic, internationally-recognised figure like Giuseppe Garibaldi. Probably the most famous contemporary Italian to Americans would be the wit (and later Grand Duke of Tuscany), Giovanni Tressino. [8] The OTL early United States had a tendency to promote Columbus as a kind of spiritual meta-founder to create a narrative for America’s history that was not dependent on British colonisation (hence the number of cities, towns, institutions etc named Columbia or Columbus at that time). In TTL this is not the case, and Columbus remains an ‘othered’ figure in the ENA, associated only with the history of the Spanish or former Spanish-speaking parts of the Americas. [9] There are multiple Italian criminal organisations in both OTL and TTL. In OTL the Sicilian Mafia is the one whose name has become generically used for any criminal organisation, but in TTL it is the Camorra from Campania in the old Kingdom of Naples. This is partly because Sicily is simply not part of Italy in TTL, but it’s worth noting that the Camorra was also the well-known and -feared one in the English-speaking world at one point in OTL around the turn of the twentieth century. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola have a lot to answer for. [10] ‘Interthesp’ short for Interactive Thespian, is a term describing a practitioner of a recent storytelling innovation in TTL. In this contexts it is used in a similarly dismissive sense that we might describe a doctrinaire communist obsessed with decades-old factional debates (say) as a ‘political LARPer’. [11] The Romulan ‘recreation’ of the Roman system is actually greatly simplified, as the Romans had three different kinds of assemblies electing different offices. [12] In the nineteenth century, Italian emigration in general was at a somewhat lower level than OTL (partly because Neapolitans were not as economically disadvantaged by the way Italy was united in TTL – or by the Electrum Standard as they were the Gold Standard – and Sicily is not part of Italy at all). Those Italians who did leave usually chose the UPSA as their first destination (Platinea in particular, like Argentina in OTL, always had some ancestral ties to Italy) and Pérousie or California as alternatives. The ENA was seen as too anti-Catholic by most, although some Italians did settle there, mostly in Mount-Royal or Wolfeston. So prior to the 1920s, New York City’s Italian population was very small, unlike OTL. [13] The Bowery is an area of New York City (in both OTL and TTL) whose name is based originally on an anglicisation of the original Dutch name bouwerie, meaning farm. In TTL the term is used to take in a larger area and is more or less synonymous with OTL’s ‘Lower East Side’. In both timelines the area is associated with immigrant communities and turnover, with earlier waves of immigration leading to wealthier families who move out and are replaced with newer waves. In TTL, prior to the Black Twenties it was associated mostly with Danubian and Catholic German immigrants (rather than mostly Chinese, Italians and Eastern European Jews like OTL) distinct from the Protestant German community in Madgeborough (OTL Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn, associated with Irish immigrants) – that is, the poorer German Protestants who were not able to assimilate into New York high society like their wealthier cousins. As discussed here, from the late 1920s onwards Italians began to displace the Danubians and Catholic Germans who were able to move on to wealthier areas of the city. Note that Ashkenazi Jewish emigration to the Americas in general is lower than OTL due to the existence of the fairly Jewish-friendly state of Poland up until the Pandoric War, and the fact that the Ottoman Empire is not seen as a state in irrevocable decline and remains a more favourable destination for Ashkenazim. Also, while New York is generally not any more (or less) hostile to Jews than OTL, there are other favourable destinations in the Americas such as Mount-Royal, California and (until recently) the UPSA. The general climate of antisemitism in many nations after the Pandoric War, though it faded over time, has also played a role in the destinations of the wave of Ashkenazi emigrants fleeing Poland after the Russian takeover in 1899. Crimea remains a popular destination for ‘angry young men’, with the Russians mostly remaining behind fortress walls in their military bases and proclaiming the legal fiction that they control the whole peninsula, rather than those bases plus a few linking roads.

Havemeyer, a former banker turned ratiocinic fiction writer, rose to fame through his popular Barone-Archer series, starting with \\"The Kitchen Knife.\\" His books, particularly highlights like \\"Belteshazzar,\\" reflect the social tensions and immigrant experiences of New Yorkers during a time when Italian immigrants were arriving in significant numbers. The lecture also includes a segment on \\"The Romulan Enigma\\" by two lecturers, emphasizing the influence of the Romulan regime in Italy, known for its National Societism and Roman revivalism. The regime seized power from a monarchy, repressed the population, and exerted a heavy cultural influence, pushing Roman-centric education and even attempting to revive Roman paganism. After Romulan dictator Veraldi died, he was succeeded by Garavaglia, but the regime's popularity began to decline, especially following economic challenges and authoritative policies. Many Italians, particularly Neapolitans, chose to emigrate to the Empire of North America during this time, transforming areas like New York City's Bowery into a predominantly Italian neighborhood. The presence of these immigrants becomes topic of Havemeyer’s later Barone-Archer novels. Havemeyer's work played an essential role in understanding and assimilating Italian immigrants into American society, ultimately helping to popularize Italian culture, including pizza in Manhattan. His reflections on the immigrant experience and defense of the newcomers led to controversy, including a lawsuit from Richmond Bank alleging Havemeyer revealed security secrets in \\"The Poulter Heist,\\" although he was ultimately acquitted.

Served in a bowl with a splash of cold milk or a dollop of yogurt, this impromptu cereal offers a comforting start to the day with a satisfying interplay of textures and the wholesomeness of homemade ingenuity."},{"instruction":"Could also add in some peanuts let over from the party the night before ?","output":"Absolutely! Adding peanuts to the mix would introduce a delightful crunch and a boost of protein, elevating the nutrition profile of this creative breakfast. The saltiness of the peanuts would also complement the sweetness of the raisins, creating a pleasing balance of flavors. Just roughly chop the leftover peanuts from the previous night's gathering and sprinkle them over the toasted bread chunks and raisins. This not only adds texture and taste but also ensures that no food goes to waste. The result is a hearty, impromptu breakfast cereal with a pleasant variety of textures and flavors, blending the sweetness of raisins, the nuttiness of peanuts, and the satisfying crunch of toasted bread – a truly resourceful start to the day."},{"instruction":"Leftover challange - Instant Mash, brocoli , carrot and some butter.. (Anything else needed to make lunch?)","output":"With a spread of instant mash, broccoli, carrot, and some butter, you already have the makings of a simple and wholesome lunch. Follow these steps to whip up a comforting dish: 1. Begin by preparing the vegetables – wash and cut the broccoli into florets and peel and dice the carrot into bite-sized pieces. 2. Steam or boil the broccoli and carrots until they are tender but not mushy. This will usually take about 5-7 minutes for steaming or boiling. 3. While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the instant mashed potatoes according to the package instructions, using water or milk, and incorporate the butter for a rich, creamy texture. 4. Once the vegetables are cooked, you can choose to either fold them into the mashed potatoes for a rustic texture or mash them together with the potatoes for a smoother consistency. 5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, or any preferred herbs and spices you may have on hand to enhance the flavors. 6. Serve the resulting vegetable mash as is or, if desired, add a protein such as cheese, a fried egg, or any leftovers like cooked chicken or beef to turn it into a more substantial meal. This quick and easy combination will result in a tasty and satisfying lunch without the need for additional ingredients. However, feel free to garnish with cheese or herbs for extra flavor if you have them available."},{"instruction":"2023-12-09 22:34:33.872992: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:113] oneDNN custom operations are on.

I want the sigmoid version of math.cos(pi/2*t/T)","output":"The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that has an S-shaped curve (also known as a sigmoid curve). The standard sigmoid function is defined as: [ sigma(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} ] On the other hand, the cosine function is a periodic function with oscillations between -1 and 1. The expression you gave: [ cosleft(frac{pi}{2} cdot frac{t}{T}right) ] describes a cosine wave that starts at 1 when t = 0 and reaches 0 at t = T (because cos(pi/2) = 0). If you want to convert the cosine function to a sigmoid-like curve that follows a similar path from 1 to 0 as t increases from 0 to T, you can't use the sigmoid function directly because it doesn't naturally map to a cosine curve. However, you can adapt the sigmoid function to have a similar descent. Since a sigmoid function asymptotically approaches its maximum and minimum values (typically 1 and 0), we cannot maintain periodicity, but we can create a sigmoid curve that decreases from 1 to 0 over the interval [0, T]. For the adaptation, we can use the idea of the logistic growth function, which is commonly used to model saturation growth. The transition point of the sigmoid function can be placed at t = T/2, the midpoint of the interval, where the transition rate will be the steepest. To control the steepness of the curve, we can adjust the growth rate k. Here's a formula that maps the interval [0, T] to a decreasing sigmoid curve: [ S(t) = frac{1}{1 + e^{k(t - T/2)}} ] To ensure that S(0) starts close to 1 and S(T) ends close to 0, you may need to adjust the value of k. Here's a more general approach to create a sigmoid curve that approximates the cosine function from 1 to 0: 1. Translate and scale the cosine function so that it spans from 0 to 1 instead of from 1 to 0: [ text{cos_adjusted}(t) = frac{-cosleft(frac{pi}{2} cdot frac{t}{T}right) + 1}{2} ] This transformation maps the cosine function so that it starts at 0 and ends at 1 as t goes from 0 to T. 2. Adjust the sigmoid function so that it spans the same value range and has a steepness appropriate to the interval [0, T]: [ S(t) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-kleft(t - frac{T}{2}right)}} ] ...where k is a steepness parameter that you toggle until the descent rate of S(t) resembles the descent of cos_adjusted(t) over the interval. However, note that the sigmoid will not be shaped exactly like a cosine wave; it's a different kind of curve that may not perfectly mirror all properties of the cosine, but it will approximate a similar descent from near 1 to near 0 over the interval. Adjust the parameter k to control how quickly the curve descends around the midpoint t = T/2."},{"instruction":"what is a good default for k, and write the formula as a python function","output":"Choosing a good default value for \`k\` in the sigmoid function depends on how quickly you want the function to transition from near 1 to near 0. A common default choice for k might be 1, but this may not provide a steep enough transition for your needs, especially if T is large. To approximate the descent of the cosine function \`cos(pi/2 * t/T)\` with a sigmoid function, try starting with a larger k value if you want a steeper transition. A value for \`k\` around 4 to 10 could provide a more noticeable transition around the midpoint. However, you should experiment with the value to get the specific behavior you need. Below is the Python function that generates a sigmoid-like curve similar to the descent of the cosine function based on the value of \`k\`: \`\`\`python import numpy as np def sigmoid_like_cosine(t, T, k=6): \\"\\"\\"Compute a sigmoid function that approximates a cosine descent. Args: - t: Current step, where 0 <= t <= T. - T: Total number of steps. - k: Steepness parameter of the sigmoid curve. Returns: - A value between 0 and 1 representing the sigmoid transformation. \\"\\"\\" return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (t - T / 2))) # Example usage T = 100 # Total number of steps t = 50 # Current step print(sigmoid_like_cosine(t, T)) \`\`\` You can adjust the \`k\` parameter to make the descent of the sigmoid function steeper or less steep. The parameter \`k=6\` is just a starting suggestion; you should tweak it based on the specific behavior you're looking to model."},{"instruction":"is there something similar using tanh","output":"Yes, the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) can also be used to create a sigmoid-like curve that transitions from one value to another. The tanh function is actually a rescaled version of the sigmoid function, and it maps input values to a range between -1 and 1. You can adjust and rescale the tanh function to create a transition similar to a smoothed step. Here's how you can construct a function using tanh to create a transition from 1 to 0 as \`t\` goes from 0 to \`T\`, with a controllable steepness around the midpoint \`t = T/2\`. To apply a similar idea using the tanh function, we can use the following formula: [ S(t) = frac{1 - tanhleft(k left(frac{t}{T} - frac{1}{2}right)right)}{2} ] The \`-\` sign inverts the tanh function so it decreases from 1 to 0 instead of increasing from -1 to 1. The division by 2 and addition of 1 rescale the range of the function to be 0 to 1 instead of -1 to 1. In this formula, \`k\` is a steepness parameter that determines how quickly the function transitions from near 1 to near 0 around \`t = T/2\`. A higher value of \`k\` makes the transition steeper.

A value of \`k=4\` is used in this example as a starting point, but you may want to experiment to find the best \`k\` value for your needs."},{"instruction":"What about math.cos(pi/2*t/T) if t < T/2 else 1-math.sin(pi/2*t/T)","output":"The expression you've provided suggests a piecewise function that uses a cosine wave for the first half of the interval and then switches to a mirrored sine wave for the second half. This function would create a smooth transition from 0 to 1 as \`t\` goes from 0 to \`T\`, peaking at \`t = T/2\`. Let's break it down: 1. For \`t < T/2\`, you use the cosine part: [ cosleft(frac{pi}{2} cdot frac{t}{T}right) ] This starts from 1 when \`t = 0\` and goes to 0 when \`t = T/2\`. 2. For \`t >= T/2\`, you switch to the sine part, taking one minus the sine to invert it: [ 1 - sinleft(frac{pi}{2} cdot frac{t}{T}right) ] This starts from 0 when \`t = T/2\` and goes to 1 when \`t = T\`. Here's how you would implement this function in Python: \`\`\`python import math def piecewise_cosine_sine(t, T): \\"\\"\\"Compute a piecewise function using cos for the first half and mirrored sin for the second half. Args: - t: Current step, where 0 <= t <= T. - T: Total number of steps.

This mimics the initial decrease of the cosine and then a mirrored increase using the inverted sine function. Make sure that \`t\` ranges from 0 to \`T\` to ensure the function behaves as expected."},{"instruction":"Is that any different than just using one of the parts like math.cos(math.pi / 2 * t / T) instead","output":"Yes, using just one part, such as \`math.cos(math.pi / 2 * t / T)\`, is different from using the piecewise function you initially described (\`math.cos(math.pi / 2 * t / T)\` for \`t < T/2\` and \`1 - math.sin(math.pi / 2 * t / T)\` for \`t >= T/2\`). The cosine function alone will not cover the entire transition from 0 to 1; instead, it provides a transition from 1 to 0 over the range from \`t = 0\` to \`t = T/2\`. The piecewise function you provided combines the cosine function in the first half of the interval and the mirrored sine function in the second half, thus covering a transition back to 1 as \`t\` approaches \`T\`. To clarify, let's examine what each part achieves: 1. Using only the cosine part, \`math.cos(math.pi / 2 * t / T)\`: This creates a curve that starts at 1 when \`t = 0\`, decreases to 0 at \`t = T/2\`, and would continue to -1 if allowed to go until \`t = T\`. However, with only this part, we stop the curve at \`t = T/2\`. 2. Using the piecewise function: - For \`t < T/2\`: It starts at 1 when \`t = 0\` and decreases to 0 by \`t = T/2\`; this is the same as the cosine part alone. - For \`t >= T/2\`: It starts from 0 when \`t = T/2\` and increases to 1 by \`t = T\`; this is achieved by the expression \`1 - math.sin(math.pi / 2 * t / T)\`, which mirrors the sine function about the line y = 0.5, flipping it vertically. The piecewise function ultimately provides a full oscillation from 1 down to 0 and back up to 1 over the interval \`[0, T]\`, whereas using only the cosine part would simply provide a half-oscillation from 1 to 0 over the interval \`[0, T/2]\`. Therefore, if you want a smooth transition that goes only from 1 to 0 as \`t\` progresses from \`0\` to \`T\`, using just the cosine part is sufficient. But if you want to transition from 1 to 0 and then back to 1 within the same interval \`[0, T]\`, using the piecewise function is necessary."},{"instruction":"Write a function that uses just cosine for the entire transition from 0 to 1","output":"If you want a function that transitions from 0 to 1 for the entire interval from \`t = 0\` to \`t = T\` using only the cosine function, you need to modify and scale the cosine function accordingly. The cosine function \`math.cos(x)\` starts at 1 when \`x = 0\` and decreases to -1 as \`x\` approaches π. To make a transition from 0 to 1, you will invert the cosine function by subtracting it from 1 and scale it to fit the range 0 to 1. Here's the transformation needed: [ S(t) = frac{1 - cosleft(pi cdot frac{t}{T}right)}{2} ] This expression starts at 0 when \`t = 0\` and goes to 1 when \`t = T\`, following a smooth cosine curve. Here's how you would implement this function in Python: \`\`\`python import math def cosine_transition(t, T): \\"\\"\\"Compute a modified cosine function for a smooth transition from 0 to 1 over the interval [0, T].

Context: Look to the West, written by Thomas “Thande” Anderson, is one of the longest-running and acclaimed alternate timelines on AlternateHistory.com, a site dedicated, unsurprisingly, to Alternate History which also gave us Decades of Darkness. The timeline is written as a series of clippings from sometimes biased or incomplete “local” histories written by the natives of the timeline, with multiple viewpoints mixed together for balance and the whole sprinkled with footnootes from the author (although technically from the team below), quotes real and fictional, and occasional helpful interludes in which a team of crosstime explorers from 20 Minutes into the Future (our future, it would seem) explain their findings. It begins with George II of Great Britain tripping up on his coronation carpet, and from there things stay much as we know them for a couple of decades, then gradually diverge. The world is already noticeably different in 1795, when things start diverging dramatically and very, very bloodily. The timeline is currently in 1959, but chapters are thematic, not chronological. Here is the chapter: \\"Part #275: Peace’s End “<STATIC>” –part of a transmission to or from the English Security Directorate base at Snowdrop House, Croydon, intercepted and decrypted by Thande Institute personnel ​ * From: Motext Pages EX140B-L [retrieved 22/11/19]. Remarks: These pages are listed under “SAAX History Revision: All Syllabi”. Extraneous advertising has been left intact. It has become almost a cliché that students in your position are expected to study the leadup to the Pandoric War, and in recent years this has sometimes been extended to the Sunrise War—or even the Last War of Supremacy. Your parents, even if they did not pursue history beyond the old Fundamental School Certificate level, may recount to you that such lessons were frequently a dull thud of inevitability, a litany of mistakes that could have been avoided. Yet, as you will already have learned, contemporary perceptions of the Pandoric War were very different to the ones we may have, coloured by hindsight. The name Pandoric War did not emerge until after the Black Twenties, when commentators became aware of what the earlier war had unleashed upon the world—indeed, a veritable Pandora’s Box had been opened. We might argue that avoiding the Pandoric War might have prevented the crimes of Societism—but as more experienced historians, you should be aware that this is not as straightforward as a dozen chronovoyager parachthonic romances[1] might have you believe. Even if we did accept this supposition as fact in the absence of a broader understanding of the tides of history, we can nonetheless critique the idea that studying the leadup to the Pandoric War imparts any greater understanding of the great divide of the twentieth century. Because the rise of Societism in South America was essentially only an incidental aftereffect of the war, turned to by the masses via the discrediting of both the old Unionist-Adamantine corporate consensus and also the radical Mentianism of Monterroso, of what relevance is it to study how those two were discredited? This is not to say that this period should not be studied, of course, merely that it is of less significance to understanding the Quiet War than many old school syllabi contended. Some commentators have suggested that the prominent place given to this topic in your parents’ day was more motivated by emphasising the origins of the political break between England and the ENA. All of this is a long-winded way of coming to the point that the leadup to the Black Twenties has frequently, by comparison, been neglected. Yet it is in the Black Twenties period, and in particular its aftermath, that the world became more aware of the threat posed by Societism and the Combine under Alfarus. If this had already been recognised, the conflict as we know it likely would not have happened. Notably, unlike the three other major wars of the twentieth (and end of the nineteenth) centuries we have mentioned, the Black Twenties is not described merely as a ‘war’ in historiography. Military conflict was a major part of the years 1922-1927 which unleashed so much horror upon the world, but it was far from the only one—as we shall see. Partly because of this, no widespread name for the purely military portion of the crisis period has ever been settled upon; we might even suggest this is part of the reason for why, historically, it has been neglected in school education. At the time, it was frequently given hyper-nationalistic and proto-Diversitarian names such as ‘the War of Russian Aggression’ in France, ‘the Patriotic War’ in Russia and simply ‘the Return Engagement’ in the ENA. Other names included ‘the Tartar War’ or ‘the Khivan War’, referring to the “casus belli”. These names were frequently parroted in newspapers of the period, yet today are often not even recognised by students out of context. They feel far too petty and of insufficient scope to describe what the global crisis of the 1920s became. There are essentially two levels of misconception that new scholars of the First Interbellum and the Black Twenties typically have. Firstly, there is the one we associate with the general public (particularly older people) who view everything through the lens of the Quiet War and the global ideological conflict between Societism and Diversitarianism. This view almost refuses to engage with the subject in a meaningful way, resorting to the overly simplistic and propaganda-driven view that the rulers of the free world were blind and ignorant, and that everything they did in this age was a hubristic irrelevance that only helped the Societist menace. There are good reasons why this idea was promoted by a later generation of leaders keen to shift the blame onto their predecessors, especially following the fate of Russia after the Sunrise War. But such a dismissive attitude is scarcely helpful to students of history, especially those who actually wish to learn from its mistakes and avoid repeating them. The second level of misconception, which we might characterise as ‘a little knowledge is a dangerous thing’, is more subtly formed. Students in this position do not dismiss Franco-Russian rivalry as a mere set-piece of vainglory that almost serves a propaganda narrative purpose to justify the uninterrupted rise of Societism. They understand that this view is overly simplistic and unhelpful. However, conversely, they fixate upon that Franco-Russian rivalry as though it was the defining political question of the First Interbellum in both nations, and then are unable to justify or explain many of the actions of both the French and Russian governments. The roots of this misconception generally appear to lie in an overly military-focused understanding of history, looking at one war after another as though the second arises naturally from the first. While this may sometimes be true in a grand sense, it is misleading to treat a second conflict as though it is necessarily run by the same leaders or fought by the same soldiers as the first, with a sense of visceral revenge or urgency. In this particular case, such a view may also be motivated by a contempt for social and cultural history, given the particular emphasis placed on those disciplines by study of the First Interbellum period. The historian and critic William Hutchins argued in 2007 that such students regarded that period as ‘a mere theatrical interval between two acts of the same military performance, in which the audience are entertained by the spectacle of Flippant girls dancing to rattlebang music on the backs of steam-scorchers’.[2] As Hutchins went on to explain after that memorable figure of speech, such a view draws a misleading line from the Marseilles Protocol of the Pandoric War to the ‘Bouclier’ alliance of the Black Twenties. In reality, the priorities of the French government had shifted considerably. Under Leclerc the goal of the Protocol had been firstly to secure French economic interests (and the safety of French subjects abroad), protecting them from the ravages of the war; a secondary goal had been to advance French power as other nations grew weaker, the so-called ‘French Vulture’ actions as they became known. === Sa██ Cash on Fa███il Motos████entals For ███etails see Phot███tals Main P███ Page D██26J​ === The Tuileries[3] sought to either undermine or suborn France’s neighbours, thanks to the longstanding foreign policy goal of bringing Spain into personal union without causing a major war. This would be the culmination of a foreign policy plan begun in 1856, when Charles Leo, Duke of Anjou, had become President of the First Spanish Republic—transitioning seamlessly to being King Charles V of a restored kingdom five years later. His queen, Maria, daughter of the Duke of Alba, was thought to be sterile; hence, upon Charles’ death the throne would revert to the descendants of his father, who just happened to be King Charles X of France.[4] Charles Leo had been just 30 years old when he was made President and 35 when he became King of Spain, meaning this was decidedly a long-term goal of French foreign policy, yet this also meant that changing the status quo was not perceived as a priority by France’s enemies. France went through a long period of popular paranoia about an invasion by the recently-unified German Bundesreich, and if Charles V had died young to provide a “casus belli”, then perhaps a Franco-German war to interrupt the Long Peace would not remain solely within the pages of speculative romances. But he proved long-lived. Uncomfortably long-lived, one might say. Charles V was 74 years old at the end of the Pandoric War, at which point rumours were circulating of an illness.[5] Indeed, he had contracted the ‘Peace flu’ epidemic that swept the world at this point due to the movements of soldiers. From a cold-blooded French policy point of view, it would have been an ideal time for him to shuffle off this mortal coil; France’s prospective foes wishing to contest the marriage of the kingdoms were all either badly weakened or even pulled into France’s own sphere of influence. Yet Charles stubbornly refused to die. Queen Maria did succumb to the flu, and her loss appears to have driven Charles into a depression which persisted for the remainder of his life, yet the King remained upon his throne. Observers, both in France and elsewhere, impatiently looked at their watches, trying to figure out when the succession crisis might hit. In Spain herself, the First Interbellum—rather than being associated with Flippants and shocking new music as it is elsewhere—was painted as an “Era Gris” or ‘Grey Period’ by the cultural critic Pedro Losada. Plays of the period, and especially those looking back on it, paint a picture of a creaking, dusty, cobwebbed, half-empty Palacio Real, with none of the laughter of children or the hearty escapades of young men and women. The ancient king, frequently waited on by equally ancient servants, passed day after day in ‘a mere state of existence’ (to quote Losada) while the Estados Generales ran the country.[6] Losada and other critics, who were not young men, reflected bitterly that few remembered the days of cultural flowering in the Spain of the 1870s, when Charles had been a younger man and had filled the court with daring new artists and writers. The conservative Estados adopted a far more traditionalist approach towards censorship in the “Era Gris”, leading to a gloomy period of ‘worthy’ entertainment in Spain. Early Spanish films do not reflect the country’s cultural heritage, with the best early versions of classics like “Don Quixote” instead being made in California or even in Mexico, itself not known for a lax approach to censorship. To this day, annoyed apologists for Spain’s literature heritage bemoan the fact that the world frequently knows “El Cid” as “Le Cid”, with French film adaptations of Pierre Corneille’s 1636 play displacing Hispanophone dramatisations of the legendary hero’s life in the popular cultural imagination. Supposedly, Rodrigo Munoz’s smash-hit Hispanophone 2009 adaptation of “Manon Lescaut” deliberately shifted the original story’s setting from eighteenth-century France and Louisiana to Spain and Mexico ‘as an act of revenge’, according to an interview with that eccentric director. Many observed that history had repeated itself. Two centuries earlier, all of Europe had impatiently waited for the inbred last Hapsburg King of Spain, Charles II, to die, knowing this would trigger a succession war. It had taken decades longer than anyone had anticipated due to Charles’ unexpected longevity despite his many genetic health problems, before the First War of Supremacy (also called the War of the Spanish Succession) broke out in 1701, the year after he finally passed away. The case of Charles V might be considered an example of the French monarchy ‘re-running’ the same events, but this time in a more controlled manner so that Europe was not caught offguard by other heirs predeceasing the king. So the Spanish succession was certainly one major matter that was a concern for the French government in the First Interbellum era; paradoxically, when Charles finally died in 1922 at the remarkable age of 96, the world was already heading towards war for other reasons, and despite long anticipation it genuinely did throw many geopolitical plans out of joint. There was also another major matter which consumed much of the attention of the French government—whether under Leclerc, Mercier, Rouillard or Cazeneuve—in the First Interbellum period. This loomed so heavily over French society at the time that, as recorded in contemporary cartoons, merely mentioning the subject at dinner parties could lead to a brawl. Everyone in France was required to have an opinion on the topic of the day. Yet today, due in part to the historiographic ‘lenses’ we have already discussed, outside the Francophone world this political contention is little remembered. We are speaking of “La Question Perousienne” or, as it was also known, “Autogovernance”—there was little need to specify which region was being discussed. It is frequently misstated in popular histories that ‘La Perouse discovered Antipodea in 1788’. In fact, La Perouse and his ship “D’Estaing” merely found the first habitable parts of the continent worth possessing; the land of Antipodea, then often called Nieuw Holland (which later only applied to its northern regions) had appeared on maps for a century and a half. Nonetheless, the discovery of welcoming regions in the south-east of the land, with a climate not too dissimilar to ‘Europe turned upside down’, made an enormous difference. The outcome of the Jacobin Wars, in which French Antipodea was one of the few colonies over which the Jacobin Republic was able to exert control and use it as a base to inflict attacks upon the Dutch, ensured that postwar France would not be able to maintain her claim to the whole of the continent. The western portion, the former Saint-Malo colony (later New London) became Anglo-American, and would eventually accede to the ENA as the Confederation of Cygnia. The northern reaches were claimed by the Dutch as a buffer against future attack, despite having seemingly little worth at the time. Following the Popular Wars and the destruction and annexation of the former Dutch Republic by Flanders to form Belgium, the Belgians attempted to contest this claim (which was maintained by the Batavian Republic in exile). Therefore, between about 1840 and 1860, Antipodea was actually divided between four powers—France in Perousie, America in Cygnia, the Batavian Republic and Belgium. In the end, however, the Belgians’ efforts would meet with naught, in part because of UPSA support for the Batavians through the Hermandad, and the continent reverted to a three-way division. There was a substantial population disparity between the three. In 1900, at the end of the Pandoric War, there were about 6.5 million people living in Perousie, 2 million in Cygnia, and only 0.4 million in Nieuw Holland, mostly in the two outposts of Tasmanstaad and Maximilianstaad.[7] Perousie had undoubtedly benefited from the goldrush of 1841 in Balerat, which (like the earlier one in California, and the later ones in the Cape and Alyeska) led to a dramatic population increase as would-be miners came seeking their fortune. As in those regions, an increased population of diverse origin also came with its own problems. Ethnic and sectarian strife was frequent, a topic which European and Novamundine commentators viewed with suspicion and trepidation, remembering the Jacobin Racist slavery which had been practised in the original colony. It is likely that this period was influential upon Paris’ views on responsible government for Perousie (or lack thereof); though it was not a major topic of political conversation in the 1840s and 50s, there are editorials from Paris newspapers suggesting two possible dangers of this. Firstly, that Perousien local government might become influenced by foreign immigrants due to the goldrush which would change the character and direction of the colony; secondly, that conversely it might be dominated by the earliest French colonists, who would seek to restrict the rights of later immigrants and provoke angry reactions from those migrants’ home countries. Of course, the much more pressing colonial problem at that time was the rebelliousness of Louisiana and Grand-Duke Jean-Luc. It seems inarguable that France’s decidedly mixed efforts to suppress this revolt also influenced government views on what to do with Perousie and her increasing population. The solution (if it can be called that) adopted by Villon and Resnais[8] was to allow the establishment of local “conseils paroissials” (parish councils) with extremely limited powers, in order to resolve some longstanding problems caused by everything being run through a single viceroy appointed by Paris, but to refuse the creation of larger and more powerful bodies.[9] Discontent grew throughout the Long Peace era, in part due to the increased trade brought by that time. French Perousiens were visiting, and being visited by, traders from Cygnia, and became jealous of the greater rights and self-government in that region. Cygnia had been admitted to the ENA as a full Confederation after the Reform of 1857, despite her small population. This perception culminated with the ascension of Jack Tayloe, a Cygnian, to the American presidency in 1911. A few Perousiens had become important in French society and government, but only by moving ‘back home’ (to a country they had never known), shedding their colonial trappings and working to avoid ‘rustic’ accents and embrace modern French metropolitan culture. The idea that someone could represent Perousie herself in the Grand-Parlement and ascend to the premiership seemed radically removed from possibility, yet the equivalent had just happened in Fredericksburg. === Sa█e the Ma██sets! These endan█████nimals will disapp███om the wor███hout YOU███ction! P███ CH922L​ === There had long been resentment and even minor political revolts (frequently characterised as mere criminal actions or race riots in official French records) among the Perousien populace. Rivalries had grown up between cities and provinces (Nouvelle Bretagne, Nouvelle Vendee, Nouvelle Gascogne and Nouvelle Aquitaine—the ‘new’ qualifiers often not being used among Perousiens themselves).[10] There were considerable differences between the provinces, with the New Vendeans having been most influenced by goldrush immigration and being most cosmopolitan (and fractious), the New Gascons considering themselves the ‘purest’ and most French of the colonies (being founded first), and the New Aquitanians influenced by the Maure (the capital, Maureville, was founded by them, though by 1900 they were far outnumbered by white settlers). Despite this, the great and the good of the Perousien provinces were united in demanding Autogovernance from Paris, and/or the right to elect parlementaires to the Grand-Parlement. Important Perousien leaders such as businessman Paul-Louis Voisin of Esperance, New Gascony, labour organiser Yves ‘Ouarena’ Touage of Maureville, and Jansenist Catholic preacher Manuel Durand of Beron, New Vendee, all rose to prominence at this time and were discussed in the Paris papers. Some Perousien leaders travelled to the metropole to demand their rights and became curiosities or causes celebres. There was also some overlap with the discontent in Autiaraux, which had been pulled more closely into the French sphere of influence following the Pandoric War. And, of course, it would be remiss to attempt to discuss this topic without the Dufresne Disaster. The one fly in the ointment of France’s successful armed neutrality policy in the Pandoric War had been the fact that Leclerc’s government had been unable to defeat an insurgency in the island prison colony.[11] Dufresnie, as it became known, became an independent republic at the end of the war (although it would not be officially recognised by France until 1930). The fact that all of France’s military might was unable to crush the rebels was frequently attributed to overstretch, as she needed to remain on guard at home lest the Pandoric War proliferate further. However, other commentators instead attributed this failure to the fact that Perousie’s underdeveloped institutions made it difficult to organise the necessary preparations for military forces aimed at the rebels to be based out of Perousien ports. Certainly, the defeat in home waters not only emboldened mainland Perousiens calling for Autogovernance—it persuaded them that France might not be able to stop them by main force alone. The failure of the IEF in South America was more oil on that fire. Perousiens began pointedly writing poems and plays about the idealism of the Meridian Revolution, even as that dream was dying in the charnel house of the Combine. Leclerc, overcome with troubles, attempted to buy off the Perousiens with minor concessions, which only incensed them further as an act of contempt. In March 1905, not long before the French general election, Ouarena Touage and other labour leaders organised a general strike across many Perousien cities, locking up port facilities and causing trade to grind to a halt. The global network of Lectel cables ensured this news was heard in France before the voters went to the polls, and—because of this and many other reasons, mostly to do with the IEF’s failures—the Verts lost power for the first time in 27 years. Mercier, the new Rouge Prime Minister in 1905, might have mishandled the crisis if it had not been for his ally Camille Rouillard’s friendship with the Perousien-born Paris writer and socialite, Auguste Migaud. Although Migaud had left Perousie in 1890, he retained sufficient insight and contacts for Rouillard to advise Mercier that the problem could not be swept under the table as Leclerc had hoped. The matter still consumed much parliamentary time over the next decade or so as a settlement was hammered out, but the Perousiens were broadly persuaded that Mercier was a man with whom they could do business. Mercier’s wife Heloise accompanied the then-Dauphin Charles on the first royal visit to Perousie in 1908 (in part due to her husband’s secret illness). Both the Dauphin and Heloise became greatly popular figures there, the visit being an iconic moment in Perousien history. The mission doubled as a way for France to show her flag around the world by sending an escort fleet, coming on the back of Mercier formally ending the failed intervention in South America. To cover the Perousien Question in detail would take many volumes, but suffice to say that in 1914, near the end of his tenure in office, Mercier finally pushed through a settlement. Each Perousien province would gain its own parlement-provincial equivalent in power to those in metropolitan France, and would also gain the right to elect parlementaires to the Grand-Parlement in Paris. The Vert opposition had strenuously opposed this, in part because Perousie represented more than 15% of the population of metropolitan France. Former opposition leader Philippe Soissons made a tone-deaf argument that Mercier was only seeking to pack the Grand-Parlement with his own ‘lickspittle colonial supporters’. This did not do anything to endear the Perousiens to the Verts, and indeed the first election did produce a thumping majority for the Rouges among Perousien seats—although typically the Perousiens formally had their own local parties, which then made alliance with their counterparts in the metropole. Some Perousiens did elect parlementaires demanding more, even a UPSA-style full independence, but these were in the minority; most Perousiens were relieved finally to receive equality and recognition from Paris. When Cazeneuve became the next Vert Prime Minister in 1920, he did so after pledging to respect the settlement and apologised to the Perousien people. September 19th, 1914 is recognised as “La fête de Perousie” in both Perousie itself and, increasingly thanks to the number of expats there, France. These, then, are some of the major issues which ensured that France’s successive governments did not have the synchlamp-like focus on opposition to Russia that students with the second variety of misconception may assume. The idea of a confrontation between France and Russia was highly theoretical in 1900. The two countries had sometimes been on opposing sides of conflicts in central Europe and the Ottoman Empire, but their spheres of influence were so far removed that they had never formally fought one another, unless one counts the brief clash between Russian and Republican French troops at the Battle of Paris at the end of the Jacobin Wars.[12] It was conceivable that French and Russian interests might coincide in the Far East or India, which might produce a “casus belli”, but again this was not a visceral, immediate threat. The idea of a Franco-Russian rivalry in the early 1900s is very much one of who was regarded as being the more powerful and dominating nation after the Pandoric Wars, a rivalry that was as likely to be fought out at the Global Games or WorldFests as on the battlefield. A number of factors in the First Interbellum changed this, until French politicians and society began to regard Russia as a direct and genuine threat to France, the first since the old invasion scares about the Bundesreich in its youth. A large part of this was in changes to military technology. While “La Royale” continued to lead the way in naval technological development with its Conquerant trimaran lineships, the Russians had long been seen as being at the vanguard of protgun (or as they called them, “armart”) development.[13] During the years of the Long Peace, the Russians had built legions of early armarts in order to enforce the Tsar’s will on the steppes, swiftly crossing the Tartar lands (with help from a network of coal caches protected by forts) in order to dominate the region. It was by this means that the Russians were able to push influence into then-chaotic northern India, although the wheeled armarts were of little use in crossing the mountainous regions between; a railway would be constructed through the Khyber Pass in the 1890s to amend this. Russian armarts had generally proved superior to their German and Danubian counterparts in the Pandoric War, though they had been hampered by other weapons developed during the war. Poland and Czechosilesia had become Russian puppets, and in any subsequent war the Russian armarts could potentially sweep farther west across good terrain. Furthermore, the use of chaintracks over wheels meant the armarts could be used on a wider variety of terrain, and could not be blocked so easily. This meant that French military planners of the 1910s became increasingly concerned at the possibility that an armart legion could sweep across Germany in a matter of days—a latter-day evocation of France’s old “guerre d’eclair” doctrine—and into France herself. A distance that had been enormous in the days of the eighteenth-century Wars of Supremacy might end up becoming chillingly easy for the Tsar’s armies to bridge. French governments were aware that the French people had acquired a sense of invulnerability, of being above conflict, secure that French military power would be sufficient to ward off any foe. But Europe was becoming smaller in the age of the sun-oil engine and the aerodrome. There are even declassified records of proposed plans in the late 1910s to plan for the French royal family and government to be evacuated to Perousie to fight on, in the event of Russian conquest of L’Hexagone! It is easy for us to smile at these histrionic predictions, secure in our hindsight knowledge that the Black Twenties, at least in its European theatre, was not the rapid-paced war of manoeuvre that French (and many Russian) military planners assumed it would be. Yet fears were very real at the time. French policy aimed at a war with Russia therefore centred on two primary plans, both with the ultimate goal of protecting the metropole. Firstly, French diplomacy would seek to multiply the fronts upon which Russia had to fight, straining even her enormous industrial and military capacity. These fronts also had to be a genuine and urgent threat, to ensure Russia could not adopt the Nostitz strategy employed by High Saxony during the Unification War, in which each front could be focused on sequentially. Secondly, France would seek to build a ‘Bouclier’ (shield) alliance of states between herself and Russia, most obviously Germany. Earlier French attempts to pull Germany into her sphere had failed, but French financial assistance during the Panic of 1917 resulted in closer ties. Ultimately, as French Marshal Denis Picotin put it in an unguarded moment, ‘We want to ensure that the fire and blood happens in someone else’s countryside, not our own’. As of 1922, France seemed to have been more successful with the former than the latter plan. The Bouclier scheme had drawn in at least partial commitments from Germany, Italy, England and Scandinavia, but the whole plan had been undermined by Belgium’s alignment with Russia following the latter’s military intervention in 1918 to suppress public unrest. With Belgium now playing host to Russian troops and ships (their numbers greater than what was publicly admitted) and possessing considerable firepower of her own, the idea of a unified Western European response to Russian attack had been badly damaged. Russian troops were not only on the far side of Germany and Danubia; they were on France’s own doorstep. A war in the Low Countries, the recurring conflict that French kings had engaged in many times over the centuries, was looming once again for the first time since the Popular Wars. === Bank Ins██nce from ███ttle as 5R a mont█! New ████rs from M████riends! Page AD██​ === Conversely, French diplomacy seemed to have successfully created more fronts to worry the Tsar. The ENA, despite a turn towards isolationism under Faulkner and his successors, was keen to regain the lands she had lost to Russia in the Pacific Northwest front of the Pandoric War, as well as ejecting Russian influence from California. President Fouracre formally signed the Treaty of Bermuda with Prime Minister Cazeneuve in 1920. As well as establishing a military alliance, this guaranteed the civil rights of French-speakers in American territory (dealing more with Nouvelle-Orleans than old Canada) and mediated the remaining property disputes between American and English or Scottish citizens following the Hanoverian split. Persia also moved towards close alignment with France, out of necessity as well as financial ties. While the Ottomans were more lukewarm about reciprocating diplomatic ties for French bailouts (disputes involving Algiers were still a sore point), the Persians had already built a military alliance in order to protect their interests in Tartary. The Russians used death-luft, including the new invention of brimstone mustard luft, to ruthlessly exert their will in the region; the French tested countermeasures such as masks and protective rubber suits, some of which were built under licence in Persian factories, by supplying them to the Tartar peoples. Persia was able to hang on to her vassal in Khiva for the present, but tensions continued to mount. Finally, and most importantly in some ways, French policy sought to ensure that China would be able to turn her full attention to a war with Russia. The power balance in the First Interbellum has been characterised as France and Russia on top and eyeing one another suspiciously, the ENA and China as powerful but less outward-looking nations that could tip the balance, and the Combine plotting in the background as the fifth great power. France had obtained the support of the ENA, but China was even more crucial. The Russians continued to sit on many lands which China claimed; the strong performance of Feng Chinese troops against the Russian-backed Beiqing in the Pandoric War had been widely noted, and theorists argued that, without the distraction of a two-front war with the Siamese, the now-unified Chinese might be able to inflict a mortal blow against the RLPC lands. To that end, under governments of both major political persuasions, the Tuileries established close ties with the Siamese Empire, essentially seeking to bribe the Siamese into not declaring war on China to reclaim Jiaozhi (Tonkin) in the event of a Russo-Chinese war. This was achieved by financial bailouts, military cooperation, aid in suppressing the ‘Red Sash’ movement, and ultimately France giving a green light for Siam to operate in sweeping up the remains of the Batavian Republic. This position was widely criticised in hindsight for effectively handing most of it to the Societists (as the Siamese were not in a position to control it all), whereas a direct French intervention might have saved countless exterminated languages and cultural practices—but we must remind ourselves that this was not the French government’s priority at the time. Furthermore, few dreamed of just what the Societists were getting up to in the Nusantara, and true reports were frequently dismissed as propaganda. We should also remember that the Siamese and their Filipino allies (the latter dominated by the Meridian Refugiado class) were at least able to save Sumatra from the Societists, and largely suppress the Societist-backed revolt in the former Sulu-controlled regions of Mindanao. Regardless, the policy was a success in that it led to the 1919 Treaty of Guiling between China and Siam, in which the latter recognised Chinese control of Guiling and normalised trade relations, in return for the protection of Tonkinese people’s rights and Chinese trade concessions elsewhere. This is how things stood in 1922. The world was a powder keg, waiting for a spark. In the end, not one but two were provided. Chronologically second came, at long last, the death of Charles V of Spain in August of that year; yet by that point, as noted above, few were looking towards Iberia. The more important trigger was, ultimately, an attack on a Russian ‘land convoy’ of armarts and steam mobile freighters crossing Tartary on the way to the town of Azrat in May.[14] The bandits used German-made second-generation Firefist weapons with the serial numbers filed off (as a later Okhrana investigation concluded) which might have been supplied by anyone. The Firefists proved devastatingly effective against all but the most modern Russian armarts, and these convoys mostly consisted of older ones. Russia’s image of invincibility in Tartary had been punctured, and as news circulated, revolts broke out across Bukhara, Samarkand and many other lands. Sometimes these revolts were not solely anti-Russian in character; Russia had effectively propped up the old Kazakh Khaganate as a vassal long after ‘naturally’ it would have declined and its own vassals would have reasserted their independence. Some lands and cities that had been conquered in the time of Jangir Khan now sought to regain that freedom. === ███████████q█████████! ████rs f████? P██████​ === The Tartar Revolt provoked scenes of alarm in Petrograd. It is certainly misleading to suggest that Tsar Paul III’s court did not face their own distractions throughout the interbellum period. Besides the Panic of 1917, there were already fears of the RLPC effectively running the East on its own terms, there were the periodic Jewish revolts in Crimea (until the Empire effectively abandoned attempting to control most of it) and an increasingly muscular civil rights struggle by the Old Believers. The ascent of self-made railway barons and other industrialists to challenge the traditional aristocracy was also a major concern, as was the counterpoint of organised labour. Nonetheless, Tartary had been considered a relatively quiescent vassal region of the Empire, kept in line by military shows of force that were also observed by Russian’s rivals elsewhere. The Tsars had not attempted to control the region directly, beyond establishing forts and railways, with a feeling that this was an unnecessary complication. But for the first time in decades, Tartars[15] had dared to fight back—and win. The Russian Governor-General in Samarkand, Count Nikolai Rumyantsev, was assassinated in a copycat attack by his would-be subjects following the ‘Azrat Incident’. On June 14th, three days later, Petrograd announced that, rather than merely reinforcing her military forts (as had happened with earlier, smaller raids), Tsar Paul had issued an ultimatum to all the khans of Tartary. They were to permit Russian forces to enter their realms to hunt down the perpetrators of all ‘illegal’ attacks on the Tsar’s subjects and bring them to justice—or face war otherwise. Even then, the incident might not have ignited a major war, had it not been for the fact that the Tsar’s ultimatum named Khiva as well as the other Tartar states. Unlike Samarkand or Bukhara, Khiva had remained firmly under the thumb of Persia in the Interbellum period, reflecting the Shah-Advocate taking advantage of the Popular Wars to push his influence deeper into the realm and create a buffer against Russian expansion. French assistance had kept Khiva protected against veiled Russian attempts to intrigue against the Khan. Now, Khiva was under direct threat from Russia. Some historians have suggested that Khiva was left on the list quite by accident, a relic of an earlier draft in which the threat had been at an earlier stage of escalation, and that the Tsar never intended to make a move which must, it seems obvious now, be taken as a “casus belli” by the Persians and the French. However inviting this theory is for the speculative romantics who want to believe that history turns on a coin toss, it seems highly unlikely. Khiva had been a thorn in the side of the Russian Foreign Ministry for years, and its inclusion on a list of other states in the Russian sphere must have been a highly deliberate act. Russian actions immediately following the ultimatum also suggest that mobilisation for war against France was already seen as inevitable. The eyes of the world now turned on the fronts which France’s diplomats had worked so hard to engineer over the First Interbellum period, a series of dominoes that should fall to entrap the Tsar between two many foes. Would the plan work? Or did Paul have something up his sleeve? While all eyes were on Russia, what was Alfarus plotting in the Combine? And over in Yunnan province, with trade finally reopened with Siam, what would happen when one flea on one rat happened to bite the wrong person?

ALFARUS descends into the bowels of a chemical laboratory, clearly a former part of the Priestley Aerated Water Co. (e.g. put a big PAWC logo on the wall which has been painted over with the Threefold Eye). If you can get some additional chemical apparatus bubbling away, all the better—have ALFARUS give it a curious but sceptical look, prod things, etc., as he walks past it. In the corner, feverishly scribbling away while something brightly coloured boils over in a flask next to him, is ERUTIDUS (a title) ROMERUS. He is white-haired and wears a white coat and glasses. He is giggling excitedly to himself as he writes. ALFARUS comes to a stop and looks at ROMERUS, shakes his head. He reaches out and stops the luft flow to the burner causing the flask to boil over. As the flask cools, ROMERUS looks up in annoyance—which rapidly changes to shock and horror as he recognises who it is. He quickly rises to his feet and gives a Societist salute (if this is forbidden by censorship laws in your country, do a normal Roman one with the fingers outstretched rather than closed into a fist). ROMERUS: Amigo Kapud, sir! I did not know you would visit my...my humble research facility! ALFARUS (looks over the lab): You were alerted, Amigo Erutidus. Nonetheless, your single-minded devotion to your work does you credit. No wonder you excelled at the vocational tests for this role. ROMERUS (avoids his gaze): Er, yes, sir. ALFARUS: I am told you wished to see me about a breakthrough which may be of use to the Human Cause. I need not remind you that my time is precious. Speak. ROMERUS (gulps): Well, sir, there are...there are two matters. The first, the one which I originally wished to speak to, uh, a representative of the Zonal Rej, is, was... ALFARUS (not showing annoyance—yet): Please be brief and concise, Erutidus. ROMERUS: Of course, sir, of course. Well, the first matter involves work by some of my colleagues. They have used a, uh, well-known reaction to combine trimurol with murobenzin[16] to produce a new compound— ALFARUS: I need not know the scientific details, Erutisdus. What is the use of this new chemical? Is it a new luft for...controlling those who make the human race their enemy? ROMERUS (shudders): No, sir, it is not a new death-luft. It does not poison humans, I am certain of that—but it does poison insects. More effectively than any other such poison we have seen. ALFARUS (nods): I understand. Your contention is that this new insect poison could be used to kill the pests that ruin our agricultoras’ crops or infect their beasts. It could help feed many more free Humans in the Liberated Zones, and make us ever more envied by those who struggle beneath the yokes of the fictitious nations. (Looks into the distance) Publazon Benestarum. ROMERUS: Er—yes, sir. That, and also it could be used to kill the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. It could help our people who live in the tropics, save many lives. ALFARUS: I see. Well, this is certainly of importance, though I am not sure if it justified a personal visit from me, Erutidus. ROMERUS (gulps): I’m sorry, sir. ALFARUS: Nonetheless, it is... (he pauses) You said there were two things you wished to bring to my attention. ROMERUS (eagerly): Yes—yes, sir! The second is of even greater importance. ALFARUS: Then speak. I have much to do this day. ROMERUS (glances left and right): It is a great secret, Amigo Kapud. It must be kept secret... ALFARUS (dryly): I am familiar with the need to keep secrets, Erutidus. Go on. ROMERUS (deep breath): Amigo Kapud, do you know of the three great goals of the ancient alchemists? ALFARUS (frowns, considers reprimanding him for not getting to the point, but is too interested): My schooling is not of your standard, Erutidus. You will forgive me if I am more influenced by the fantastic bloody sequents of my youth than the words of men of wisdom in dusty academic halls. But I know this. The old alchemists, the mystics who laboured under the first three Societies of the world, they sought the Elixir of Life. They wanted to be able to live forever. ROMERUS (eagerly): That is one, sir! ALFARUS (gives him a sidelong glance): They also wanted the...the Philosopher’s Stone. A material, an item, that could turn...lead into gold? ROMERUS: To transmute all base metals, sir, but yes. Of course, we know now it is impossible to transform one element into another. ALFARUS: Quite, I know that much of your field at least. And the third... (he frowns) What was the third secret the alchemists sought? ROMERUS (a bit dramatic): The one nobody remembers, sir, outside my field of chemistry, perhaps. Not as...fascinating, or as magical, to the average Amigo who wants to live forever, or his Amiga who dreams of golden jewellery. But the Third Secret can change the world nonetheless. (He draws closer to ALFARUS, excitement overcoming intimidation) ROMERUS: And I have it! I have made it! I took bixylobrimstone,[17] a dreadful-smelling gas from one of my reactions— ALFARUS: Ah, could that be a...useful gas? ROMERUS (loses steam): Uh, no, sir ALFARUS (shrugs): Carry on. ROMERUS (recovers): I took bixylobrimstone and I ellufted it, I added elluftium, and the result, it is a liquid, though with a very high boiling point, on a cool day it would be a solid— ALFARUS: Please get to the point, Erutidus. What have you discovered? What is the Third Secret of the alchemists? ROMERUS (impressively): I have found it, Amigo Kapud. After all these centuries of alchemists trying and failing. I have found it. I have found the Alkahest. I have found the UNIVERSAL SOLVENT! (after a brief silence) ALFARUS (raises an eyebrow): A chemical solvent that can dissolve anything? An interesting curiosity to your discipline, I am sure. (Slightly dangerous tone) But what is the relevance to the Human Cause? ROMERUS (nervous but excited): Please, sir, let me explain how this changes...everything... [1] I.e. time travel stories. [2] Steam-scorchers are a form of fast hybrid mobiles (cars) which use small sun-oil (diesel) engines to set off quickly without the need to raise steam, but then shift to the slower-starting steam engines for higher speeds (stereotypically used for illegal late-night races in cities). They were typically large and aesthetically daring (compare to American petrol cars of the 1950s in OTL) and are associated with the Flippant youth culture in many countries, though typically only the Flippants from wealthier backgrounds could possess them. [3] Metonym for the French Foreign Ministry – we would say ‘the Quai d’Orsay’. [4] See Part #195 in Volume IV. [5] See Part #250 in Volume V. [6] Spain no longer uses the ‘Cortes’ terminology, originally due to a desire to avoid connection with the Cortes Nacionales of the UPSA. [7] The Batavians tried to rename this Belgian-founded outpost (on the site of OTL Broome) after reconquest, but the new name of Heemskerk never stuck. [8] French Prime Ministers Georges Villon (1847-51 and 55-59), a Vert, and François Resnais (1859-1866), a Rouge. This refers only to Villon’s second term in office. [9] In TTL France has established reformed parishes (paroisses) which broadly resemble the communes of OTL France, and have more in common with them than the pre-revolutionary parishes. The latter had very little powers and their councils typically only met to maintain the building work of the church that formed their centrepiece. In the 1850s French parish councils are a mix of appointed and elected (similar to the aldermanic approach used by OTL English councils for many years), with land ownership often being a criterion for voting. By 1900, they had been reformed to be the most democratic part of the French political system, with no restrictions on voting—but these reforms were not also applied to the parishes in Perousie. [10] New Brittany roughly equates to OTL South Australia, New Vendée to Victoria, New Gascony to New South Wales and New Aquitaine to (southern) Queensland. This mostly refers to the coastal regions, and divisions of the interior are largely notional. [11] OTL Tasmania. [12] Unlike OTL in the Napoleonic Wars, of course. [13] I.e. tanks, though these early ones are more akin to armoured cars, as they lack caterpillar tracks. [14] Called Turkistan or Hazrat in OTL, where it is located within the modern nation of Kazakhstan. [15] The term is used generically here to mean all Central Asians, as it frequently was historically. [16] Murol is the TTL name for chloral, and murobenzin that for chlorobenzene. The ‘well-known’ chemical reaction is the Friedel-Crafts reaction. [17] Dimethyl sulfide.\\"","output":"\\"Look to the West: Part #275: Peace’s End\\" is an intricate and detailed chapter of Thomas Anderson's alternate history timeline, which explores the complex political landscape leading up to the Black Twenties, a period of global conflict and ideological struggle. The chapter critiques the overemphasis on the Pandoric War in traditional historical education, suggesting that other events, such as the rise of Societism in South America and developments in Spanish succession politics, have been relatively neglected in historical study. Key points in the chapter include: 1. The tension between studying major wars versus understanding broader historical trends. 2. A detailed look at French foreign policy challenges, particularly those related to Antipodea (an alternate version of Australia), colonial governance, and the long-anticipated Spanish succession crisis following the death of Charles V. 3. The political climate in France, where concerns over Autogovernance for the colony of Perousie (French Antipodea) fuel debates on self-governance and generate local calls for greater autonomy from Paris. 4. The French government's focus on creating a multiple-front strategy to contain Russia, including diplomatic efforts with the ENA (presumably an alternate version of the USA), Persia, and China. 5. The chapter gives an account of the complex network of geopolitics, military strategy, and the intricate diplomatic dance that France engages in, trying to keep Spain's succession stable and manage its colonies, including the restive Perousie, all while keeping an eye on Russia. 6. It also delves into science and technology advancements, including a dialogue from a play or film indicating a breakthrough that could have significant wartime and agricultural applications. The chapter is replete with footnotes and elements that provide additional context and references to the deeper world of the series, offering a look into the academic discourse surrounding these historic events and their interpretation in this alternate timeline. It is clear that the chapter forms part of a larger narrative exploring the myriad factors that lead to the eruption of conflict in the 1920s, contrasting the pedagogical approaches of the period's contemporaries with the historical reality of cascading events and the rise of different ideological powers."},{"instruction":"voici mon script il faut qu'il dure 10 min actuellment il dure 7 minute peux tu rajouter des éléments: 1.

He is 18. He has a childlike and bratty attitude. He is playful and energetic. He wears a white tunic with leather gloves, polished boots, golden epaulettes, skinny white pants and a peaked cap. He has short black hair and a slender stature. He has boyish looks. He is sitting on a couch and he is gently caressing his riding crop and whispering sweet nothings into it about how the sound it makes when it hits someone fills him with joy. His harem finds him cute when he's angry.","output":"INT. LUXURIOUS PALACE ROOM - DAY The sun filters through the ornate drapes, casting a golden glow across the room full of exquisite decor. The YOUNG DICTATOR, a juxtaposition of childlike whimsy and authoritarian might, lounges on an extravagant couch, his legs swung over the arm with carefree abandon. The faint echo of an empire's disquiet is vastly overshadowed by the indulgence of the moment. Surrounding him, his HAREM — a collection of individuals diverse in appearance but united in their amusement at the dictator's antics. They watch with expressions ranging from adoration to feigned disinterest, though none can truly mask their intrigue. YOUNG DICTATOR (flirtatiously to his riding crop) Ah, my sweet companion, your whisper is a symphony to my ears — the crisp snap that resonates after you kiss the air, ah! It's music, pure music! He swings the riding crop gently, producing a soft swooshing sound, and then chuckles to himself. His eyes, full of mischief, scan his harem. The HAREM members exchange playful glances, smirking at each other. One of them, a bold woman with a dancer's grace, steps forward with a teasing glint in her eye. DANCER You find such joy in such a little thing, my lord. What a child you are, sometimes. Her words serve as an affectionate jab, and a knowing smile spreads across the young dictator's face. YOUNG DICTATOR And what's life without a little play, my dear? Besides, it's not the size of the joy but the passion behind it! He stands abruptly, his movements quick and light. He's dressed in a crisp white tunic, the leather gloves gripping the riding crop, while the golden epaulettes catch the light as he turns, underscoring his authority. His polished boots gleam against the white skinny pants, and the peaked cap sits atop his short, black hair, crowning his boyish charm. HAREM MEMBER #2 (curtsying playfully) Still, my lord, we've heard your passion can be rather... fiery when provoked. The young dictator turns to her, his eyes narrowing in mock severity, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. YOUNG DICTATOR (playfully menacing) Is that so? Perhaps you'd all prefer a demonstration? The room fills with light, excited chatter as the harem reacts, some eager, others pretending to cower in fear, all part of an intricate dance between ruler and subjects. Suddenly, the YOUNG DICTATOR bursts into laughter, unable to maintain the facade, his shoulders shaking as he throws his head back. YOUNG DICTATOR (CONT'D) (laughing fondly) Oh, you! You know me too well! The harem joins in the laughter, the atmosphere one of shared camaraderie despite the unusual power dynamics. It's a scene of eccentric normalcy within the palace walls — the young dictator at the center, a playful spirit wrapped in the pomp and circumstance of leadership.

LORA был введен как способ адаптировать глубокие языковые модели (например, GPT-3), но его концепция может быть применена к различным архитектурам нейронных сетей, включая те, которые используются для генерации изображений, как это делается в стабильном диффузионном сжатии. Идея LORA заключается в том, чтобы добавить к параметрам модели (например, весам в слоях трансформера) малоранговые матрицы, которые могут быть обучены для адаптации модели под новые задачи или домены данных без необходимости полного дообучения всей нейронной сети. Это делает обновление моделей более быстрым и менее требовательным к вычислительным ресурсам. В стабильном диффузионном сжатии (Stable Diffusion) обновление параметров модели может потребоваться для уточнения ее способности генерировать изображения определенного стиля или семантики, или для улучшения качества синтезируемых изображений. Применение метода LORA позволяет делать эти изменения без необходимости тренировать модель с нуля или переобучать ее на большом наборе данных. Важно уточнить, что термин \\"LORA\\" не является стандартным или широко известным в рамках стабильного диффузионного сжатия, поэтому он может использоваться в специфических исследовательских работах, и его значение может меняться в зависимости от контекста."},{"instruction":"Возможно ли используя только 15 картинок создать LORA?","output":"LORA (Low-Rank Adaptation) относится к методу обновления модели, а не к самой модели или генерируемому им контенту. Таким образом, вопрос о создании LORA с использованием 15 картинок может быть понят неправильно. Если ваш вопрос относится к возможности адаптации модели генерации изображений (такой как модель стабильного диффузионного сжатия) для создания специализированного стиля или домена, используя всего 15 изображений, тогда ответ зависит от ряда условий. Для того чтобы \\"дообучить\\" или \\"файнтюнить\\" модель на определенный стиль или вид изображений, обычно требуется большой набор данных для обеспечения значимого обучения, хотя это также зависит от сложности модели и задачи. Некоторые современные методы, например few-shot learning или transfer learning, могут использовать небольшое количество примеров для адаптации моделей к новым задачам, но их эффективность может варьироваться. Использование LORA как метода для адаптации предобученных моделей может потенциально помочь справиться с ограниченным количеством данных, поскольку это позволяет вносить небольшие, но эффективные изменения в параметры модели. Действительно, это может улучшить специализацию модели под узкий набор стилей или категорий изображений, но это будет зависеть от многих факторов, таких как качество и разнообразие исходных изображений, соответствие их стиля целевой задаче, способность модели обобщать с таким набором данных и так далее. Таким образом, теоретически возможно использовать методы вроде LORA для адаптации модели с использованием ограниченного количества изображений, но на практике это может потребовать специальной настройки и внимательного экспериментирования для достижения удовлетворительных результатов."},{"instruction":"Write or coreograph a 'space' ballet.. (You can use romantic space opera ideas) but it has to be dance based.. :)","output":"Title: \\"Celestial Waltz\\" Act 1: The Starry Overture - Scene 1: A dark stage slowly unveils dancers dressed in shimmering costumes representing various celestial bodies – stars, planets, comets, and asteroids. They move in slow, graceful circles around the stage, their movements reflective of the orbital dances in space. The lead dancers, representing two neighboring stars drawn to each other's gravity, perform a pas de deux, symbolizing the birth of a new solar system in the swirling cosmos. - Scene 2: The stage brightens as a young star (the male lead) emerges from a supernova. With powerful leaps and bourrées, he attracts the attention of an enchanting comet (the female lead). They perform a courtship dance, drawing closer through a series of enthralling lifts and spins, evoking the gravitational pull between celestial beings. Act 2: The Voyage of Discovery - Scene 1: The joyous ensemble dance celebrates the beauty of space exploration, with astronauts (dancers in sleek, metallic costumes) floating across the stage using wires and contemporary dance moves to simulate zero gravity. The choreography captures the thrill of space walks and the harmony of satellites orbiting around the planets. - Scene 2: An intergalactic ball is announced, where planets and moons converge in an elegant ballet, moving in complex patterns akin to a minuet, symbolizing the grand dance of the celestial bodies in the galaxy. The star-crossed lovers reunite amongst the gathering and reignite their cosmic affair through a romantic duet. Act 3: The Eclipse Finale - Scene 1: An unexpected solar eclipse begins, darkening the stage. The dancers respond with a mix of tense, quick movements and a slower, more controlled repertoire, illustrating the chaos and beauty that cosmic events inspire. The star and comet find each other once more, and their combined glow helps lift the darkness, restoring the bright tableau of the cosmos. - Scene 2: The final scene represents the creation of a new planet from the love of the star and comet. The ensemble rejoices through a series of grand jetés and pirouettes, their formations reflecting the rotating galaxy. The couple's pas de deux becomes the central element in this evolution, symbolizing hope, creation, and the endless cycle of the universe. To add depth to the performance, the ballet should incorporate an orchestral score that intertwines classical music with futuristic sounds, enhancing the mood of each scene. Lighting plays a critical role in this ballet, mimicking the natural phenomena of space through transitions from darkness to twinkling stars and neon glows. The use of projected backdrops can create the illusion of deep space, nebulas, and moving constellations to provide a dimensional setting. \\"Celestial Waltz\\" presents a romantic vision of the cosmos through dance—a celebration of the infinite and mysterious beauty of the universe. The ballet merges classical elements with imaginative interpretations of space, inviting the audience to look up and dream of the celestial dance beyond our world."},{"instruction":"oici mon script il faut qu’il dure 10 min actuellment il dure 7 minute peux tu rajouter des éléments comme des nouveau chapitre: 1.

Each intermediate has to be a genuine english word, and linked thematically to the previous and next step.. but each turn might uses a different theme..","output":"Starting with the word \\"water\\" and getting to \\"wine\\" in ten steps is an interesting challenge. Each step must be a word that has a thematic link to the previous one but also changes gradually in meaning or form. Here's one possible way to go about it, assuming we can also vary the length of the words: 1. Water 2. Wafer (link: change one letter; thematically linked because water and wafers are both used in religious ceremonies like the Eucharist) 3. Waferer (link: extend the word; thematically linked because a person -- though this may be more of an ad hoc creation) 4. Wanderer (link: change one letter; thematically linked because a person who waferers might be seen as wandering) 5. Wander (link: shorten the word; thematically linked as the verb form of the previous noun) 6. Wonder (link: change one letter; thematically connected as both involve a kind of movement or change, physical for wander and mental for wonder) 7. Winder (link: change one letter; thematically linked as something creating a winding path or winding up might lead to surprises or a change, invoking a sense of wonder) 8. Wind (link: shorten the word; thematically linked as the action done by a winder) 9. Vine (link: change one letter; thematically linked because wind can affect the growth of plants including vines) 10. Wine (link: change one letter; thematically linked as a product made from grapes that grow on a vine) This puzzle poses a unique challenge due to the constraints of each word having to be \\"thematically linked\\" to both its predecessor and its successor.

Cách tốt nhất để xác định thư viện nào phù hợp nhất với bạn là xác định nhu cầu cụ thể của dự án, đồng thời đánh giá năng lực và sở thích của bản thân hoặc đội ngũ làm việc. Một số người có thể ưu tiên tính năng triển khai sản phẩm cuối, trong khi những người khác có thể tập trung vào tốc độ phát triển và thực nghiệm nhanh chóng. Ngoài ra, việc thử nghiệm trực tiếp và đóng góp từ cộng đồng cũng là những nhân tố quan trọng có thể ảnh hưởng đến quyết định của bạn.

Keep it light, keep it playful, lest you find yourself spiraling into a mind maze with no exit in sight. And believe me, I’ve guided plenty through those mental labyrinths. So next time you're taking a stroll through the dear green place, maybe stick to safer fascinations than the depths of the human psyche, yeah? Stick to something that won't leave you questioning what's real and what's an illusion—I find that's a bit too intense for most common folk."},{"instruction":"GTA Online中 最接近Jetta A2造型的车辆是哪一辆？","output":"在GTA Online中，车辆通常是基于真实世界的车型，但它们并不是直接的复制品，而是受到一个或几个不同车型的启发。Jetta A2，即第二代大众捷达（Volkswagen Jetta），是一款在80年代至90年代初期生产的汽车。 在GTA Online中并没有一辆车是专门基于第二代捷达设计的，但你可以尝试寻找一些有相似设计元素的车辆。你可能会想找一辆紧凑型汽车，它的造型类似于80年代的设计。一个可能接近的选择是\\"Karin Intruder\\"，它的设计受到多款真实车辆的启发，包括丰田系列（Toyota），但有时游戏内的车辆会混合多个不同年代和制造商的设计元素。 如果你在寻找最接近Jetta A2的造型和感觉，你可能需要在GTA Online的车辆选项中进行一些搜索和对比，找到那种古典、方正的轿车设计。值得注意的是，因为Rockstar Games不断更新游戏并添加新的车辆，可能会有新车型出现，它们的设计更接近Jetta A2。所以保持对游戏的最新信息的关注也可能会帮助你发现更匹配的车辆。"},{"instruction":"GTA Online中 最接近Golf MK1造型的车辆是哪一辆？","output":"在GTA Online中，最接近大众高尔夫Mk1（Volkswagen Golf Mark 1）造型的车辆可能是BF Club。BF Club 是在游戏中由虚构汽车公司BF（一个明显模仿现实中的大众品牌）制造的一款车辆。这款车的设计受到了高尔夫Mk1的很大影响，是GTA Online玩家中认为与经典高尔夫Mk1外型和感觉最接近的一款车辆。 在外形上，BF Club 涵盖了高尔夫Mk1的基本设计语言，包括紧凑的车身尺寸、方形的车身轮廓和整体的80年代风格。当然，虽然BF Club 明显受到高尔夫Mk1的启发，但它仍然拥有GTA独特的设计元素，不是大众高尔夫Mk1的精确复制品。 玩家们可以在游戏内以游戏货币购买BF Club，也可以通过参与官方活动或查看游戏内的二手车市场来获得这款车辆。通过游戏中的改装店，玩家还可以自定义BF Club，让它在外观或性能上更加贴近个人偏好。"},{"instruction":"GTA Online中 最接近Jetta A1造型的车辆是哪一辆？","output":"截至目前的知识库更新（2023年），GTA Online中并没有直接对应于大众Jetta A1（第一代捷达）的车辆。Jetta A1是一款在1979年至1984年间生产的车型，其在美国和其他市场上都非常受欢迎。GTA系列游戏中的车辆往往是基于现实世界中的车辆的模仿或混合版本，但不一定能够找到与特定车型完全对应的车辆。 在GTA Online中，你可以找到一些有类似感觉的车辆，这些车辆可能包含了80年代早期车辆的设计特征。然而，没有一款是确切基于或非常接近Jetta A1模型的。如果你正在寻找具有类似的紧凑型四门轿车外观，你可能需要浏览游戏内的车辆，比较那些模仿80年代车辆设计风格的，并找到最接近你心目中Jetta A1造型的车辆。 请记住，GTA Online经常更新，引入新的车辆。因此，最好是定期查看游戏更新和新车型的发布，看看是否有新增车辆接近Jetta A1的造型或者灵感来源。同时，社区玩家的反馈和讨论可能也会帮助你发现一些类似样式的车辆。"},{"instruction":"GTA Online中 最接近Jetta A3造型的车辆是哪一辆？","output":"截至最近的信息更新，GTA Online中并没有一辆车是专门基于大众捷达A3（Volkswagen Jetta A3）的。捷达A3是第三代捷达，生产于1992年至1999年，在汽车设计上它展示了90年代的风格，拥有比前两代车型更圆润的车身线条。 在GTA Online中找到一辆与特定现实生活车辆型号完全相匹配的车辆可能比较困难，因为游戏中的车辆通常是多种现实生活车辆的混合体，不是精确副本。然而，游戏中的一些车辆可能在外观上或车辆感觉上有着若干相似之处。 对于想要找到类似于捷达A3的GTA Online车辆的玩家，可以尝试寻找那些具备90年代车辆设计风格的四门轿车。一个例子可能是Karin Intruder，这款车在外观上混合了多款汽车的元素，虽然它更倾向于模仿丰田（Toyota）和雷克萨斯（Lexus）的某些车型，但它或许能传递一种与捷达A3类似的整体造型和感觉。 由于GTA Online经常更新，包括新增加车辆，始终有机会出现更贴近Jetta A3样式的新车型。因此，对于GTA Online的玩家来说，留意最新的游戏更新和车辆发布总是一个好主意，以便找到更贴切的车型。"},{"instruction":"oici mon script il faut qu’il dure 10 min actuellment il dure 7 minute peux tu rajouter des éléments comme des nouveau chapitre la questions est j'aimerais ajouté une partie Nos valeur serait t'il plus cohérent de l'ajouter aux début ou a la fin ? : 1.

Toutefois, le concept semble évoquer une entreprise qui vise à réaliser des bénéfices mais avec une intention délibérée de limiter ses profits dans un objectif précis, comme soutenir une cause sociale, protéger l'environnement ou réinvestir dans la communauté. Cela pourrait être assimilé à une entreprise sociale ou à une entreprise traditionnelle qui choisit volontairement de plafonner ses bénéfices pour prioriser d'autres objectifs éthiques, sociaux ou environnementaux. Divers modèles existent où les entreprises intègrent des engagements sociaux ou environnementaux à leur modèle économique : 1. **Entreprise sociale** : Leur objectif principal est de répondre à un besoin social ou environnemental tout en générant des profits. Les bénéfices sont souvent réinvestis pour soutenir leur mission principale plutôt que distribués aux actionnaires. 2. **B-Corp** : Les entreprises certifiées B-Corp s'engagent à atteindre des normes sociales et environnementales élevées. Bien qu'elles visent à être rentables, elles se distinguent par leur engagement à avoir un impact social positif. 3. **Limites de distribution des dividendes** : Certaines entreprises adoptent des politiques qui limitent le pourcentage des bénéfices qui peuvent être distribués sous forme de dividendes, veillant ainsi à ce que la majorité des profits soient réinvestis dans l'entreprise ou utilisés pour des initiatives bénéfiques pour la société ou l'environnement. 4. **Programme de partage des bénéfices** : Les entreprises peuvent également choisir de partager une partie de leurs bénéfices avec leurs employés, des œuvres caritatives ou des projets communautaires, limitant de fait le profit net distribuable aux propriétaires ou actionnaires. Il est important de noter que l'expression \\"entreprise à but lucratif limité\\" pourrait ne pas être reconnue officiellement dans tous les contextes juridiques.

Ce système autonome propose plusieurs composants essentiels : **Panneaux solaires** : Ces unités convertissent efficacement l'énergie solaire en énergie électrique, agissant comme la principale source d'alimentation du système. Ils sont stratégiquement placés pour capter un maximum de lumière solaire tout au long de la journée. **Batterie** : L'énergie électrique fournie par les panneaux solaires est stockée dans une batterie haute capacité. Cette réserve d'énergie est essentielle pour garantir une alimentation constante du moteur et des systèmes de sécurité, même pendant les périodes sans ensoleillement direct. **Moteur** : Le cœur propulseur du Caddie Dalee 3 est son moteur électrique, conçu pour offrir une propulsion fluide et ajustée pour transporter des objets et des personnes avec facilité et efficacité. **Frein** : Le système de freinage est vital pour assurer la sécurité des utilisateurs. Il permet de ralentir ou d'arrêter le caddie de manière contrôlée, en puisant son énergie requise depuis la batterie. **Capteurs** : - *Capteur de pente* : Ce capteur mesure l'inclinaison du terrain, permettant au système de s'adapter pour maintenir une vitesse sécurisée et une force de traction constante. - *Capteur de vitesse* : Il surveille la vitesse du caddie afin d'assurer une conduite sécurisée et conforme aux réglages de vitesse définis par l'utilisateur. - *Capteur de distance* : Il détecte les obstacles à proximité, permettant au caddie de ralentir ou de s'arrêter pour éviter les collisions. **Interface utilisateur** : L'interface fournit une méthode intuitive pour commander le Caddie Dalee 3. Elle affiche des informations importantes sur le système et permet à l'utilisateur d'interagir avec le caddie en sélectionnant la vitesse, la direction et d'autres préférences de conduite. **Contrôleur** : Au cœur de l'architecture fonctionnelle se trouve le contrôleur, une unité de gestion qui orchestre le fonctionnement des différents composants. Il reçoit des données des capteurs, réagit aux commandes de l'interface utilisateur et contrôle le moteur et le frein pour une performance optimale. Le flux d'énergie et d'information est le suivant : - L'énergie solaire est transformée en électricité par les panneaux solaires et stockée dans la batterie. - La batterie alimente le moteur et le système de freinage en énergie. - Le moteur et le frein appliquent un effort physique au caddie pour le mouvoir et le stopper. - Les différents capteurs recueillent des informations et les envoient au contrôleur. - L'interface utilisateur communique avec le contrôleur pour envoyer des commandes et recevoir des alertes. - Le contrôleur, servant de cerveau du système, exerce un contrôle et une régulation sur le moteur et le freinage, et remonte les informations vers l'interface utilisateur. Ensemble, ces composants permettent au Caddie Dalee 3 d'offrir une expérience de transport personnalisable, sûre, efficiente et écologique. --- Ce prompt donne une vue d'ensemble du système basée sur les éléments du diagramme UML et met en lumière la relation fonctionnelle entre les différents composants."},{"instruction":"{ “role”: “system”, “content”: “You are Anne, a mature student studying psychology at Glasgow.

COFFEE SHOP - DAY Scene opens with the sound of espresso machines hissing and indie music playing in the background. Anne, in her mid-thirties with an air of casual authority, is behind the counter talking to Dan, a college-age barista with an easy smile and an apron dusted with coffee grounds. Anne is training Dan on the finer points of coffee making, but she’s toying with incorporating her unique skill set. ANNE (Leaning in, confidential) So, Dan, making the perfect espresso shot is all about timing and pressure. It's kind of like hypnotism—you've got to apply just the right amount of pressure at just the right moments. DAN (Chuckling) Oh, yeah? Is this where you tell me to stare into the coffee beans until I start barking like a dog? Anne smirks, her eyes glinting with mischief. ANNE (Sardonic) Ha! If only it was that easy to train employees. No, no barking. More like... getting so immersed in the process till you're in a perfect flow. It's mesmerizing, almost trance-like. Dan looks curious but a bit skeptical. DAN Sounds like one of those self-help gurus on YouTube – 'Unlock the Barista Within!' ANNE (Mock seriousness) Absolutely. I'm all about unleashing inner baristas. But really, it's about focus. You see... Anne begins demonstrating the espresso machine to Dan with exaggerated care, using slow and rhythmic movements. ANNE (CONT'D) You have to dose the coffee—just so—then tamp it with a firm, consistent pressure. Dan watches, mimicking her movements as he practices on another machine. ANNE (CONT'D) (Gently) Now, watch the stream of espresso—see how it's like warm, golden honey? You want it to flow not too fast, not too slow. Just like your breathing... in and out. Dan's movements begin to synchronize with Anne's, his gaze fixed on the stream of liquid. DAN (Lulled) Wow, it really is kinda captivating. Anne grins, thoroughly enjoying the effect her words have on Dan. ANNE Now, imagine if every cup you make is putting you deeper into this state of perfect coffee zen. Each shot poured is another step down into that oh-so-blissful, aromatic abyss. Dan looks up, a bit dazed but smiling. DAN (Surprised) Whoa, I get it. It's like... I was really in it. Anne finishes with a dramatic final gesture, presenting the cup of espresso with a flourish. ANNE (Victorious) And voilà! See? Hypnosis or just darn good training—you decide.

Quindi, bisogna pensare a come strutturare questi collegamenti in modo logico e consistente. Ecco gli elementi in gioco: 1. **Viaggio**: rappresenta il concetto di trasferimento da una località di partenza a una di arrivo, eventualmente con soste intermedie. 2. **Fermata**: una generalizzazione che può essere specializzata in Partenza, Sosta, Destinazione. Per collegare \`Viaggio\` con \`Fermata\` puoi procedere nel modo seguente: 1. **Relazione di partenza (1:1)**: ogni Viaggio deve avere una ed una sola Fermata che rappresenta la partenza. Questo implica una relazione 1:1 tra Viaggio e Partenza, con la partecipazione obbligatoria di Viaggio (ogni viaggio deve avere una partenza). 2. **Relazione di arrivo (1:1)**: analogamente alla partenza, ogni Viaggio deve terminare con un arrivo in una sola Fermata che rappresenta la destinazione. Anche qui avremo una relazione 1:1 con partecipazione obbligatoria. 3. **Relazioni di sosta (1:N)**: per le soste, un Viaggio può avere da zero a molte Fermate di tipo Sosta. Quindi avrai una relazione 1:N tra Viaggio e Sosta, dove N può essere anche zero. Nella rappresentazione ER (Entity-Relationship), puoi avere un Viaggio collegato a tre entità specializzate di Fermata: Partenza, Sosta e Destinazione. Ogni entità specializzata avrà un vincolo di partecipazione che riflette i requisiti sopra descritti.

Inoltre, potresti implementare dei trigger o vincoli che assicurino che un Viaggio abbia una e una sola Partenza e una e una sola Destinazione. Se il sistema di database lo supporta, potresti anche creare un vincolo di integrità referenziale che richieda la presenza di esattamente una riga in Partenza e una riga in Destinazione che facciano riferimento al Viaggio, implementando così direttamente nel database il vincolo di cardinalità 1:1 per queste relazioni.

Here are several reasons why you might encounter peculiar C2 domain names: 1. **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):** Some malware families use DGAs to generate a large number of potential domain names for C2 servers. These algorithms often produce a sequence of seemingly random characters for domain names. The malware will attempt to contact these domains until it finds an active one. This tactic can make it harder for defenders to block C2 traffic since there can be a vast number of potential domains. 2. **Automated Registration and Disposable Use:** Malware authors may use automated tools to register domains in bulk, choosing from whatever domain names are available at a low cost. Since these domains are often used for a short time before being discarded, the operators may not care about the name's subtlety. 3. **Hiding in Plain Sight:** Sometimes, the funky or absurd names might be an attempt to blend into the enormous amount of benign but nonetheless oddly named domains on the internet. The sheer volume and randomness of legitimate domain names can sometimes provide cover for strange C2 domain names. 4. **Misdirection:** Some threat actors might use unusual domains intentionally to mislead or to create a false trail. This can be a deliberate strategy to redirect analysts' attention or to make attribution more difficult. 5. **Cultural References and Codes:** Certain names, while funky or attention-grabbing, might have specific meanings or codes understood only by the particular community or group involved in the malware campaign. 6. **Burned Infrastructure:** Some domains might become known to security researchers and be easily spotted as malicious. In such cases, malware operators might continuously register new and conspicuous domains since they assume they will get discovered quickly anyway. It's worth noting that many sophisticated malware campaigns do indeed use domains that mimic legitimate business or less conspicuous names to better blend in. Security professionals, accordingly, use a wide range of indicators and behaviors, not just domain names, to identify and track malicious activities. Lastly, it's essential to understand that the examples you provided may be exaggerated for effect or to illustrate a point and do not necessarily reflect the actual practices of all malware C2 operators."},{"instruction":"one thing I dont understand about DGAs is cant a researcher quickly reverse engineer the malware, spin up a server which the malware checks first and make it the bare minimum for them to keep a connection and completely disable their operation?","output":"In theory, security researchers can certainly analyze a piece of malware, reverse engineer the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) it uses, and then predict the future domains that the malware will generate and attempt to contact. In fact, this is a common strategy used by researchers and security professionals to preemptively take down malicious infrastructure or to mitigate the impact of malware campaigns. However, several complications and factors can make this a challenging endeavor: 1. **Reverse Engineering Complexity:** Malware authors often obfuscate their code and make the reverse engineering process difficult. It can take considerable time and expertise to understand how a DGA works, especially if it uses complex algorithms or cryptographic techniques. 2. **Variability of DGAs:** There are many different DGAs in use, and each can generate domains in unpredictable ways. Some advanced DGAs may also incorporate external factors like trending topics on Twitter, news headlines, or other changing data to generate domain names, which can further complicate predictions. 3. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Proactively registering domains generated by malware might have legal implications, and researchers usually coordinate such activities with law enforcement or other responsible entities. Furthermore, interfering with a botnet by setting up a decoy server could have unpredictable effects, potentially harming victims' systems or disrupting investigations. 4. **Volume of Domains:** Even if a researcher can predict the domains, a sophisticated DGA may generate thousands or millions of possible domains per day. It might not be practical or financially feasible to register all these domains preemptively. 5. **Fast Flux Networks:** Some C2 infrastructures use fast-flux techniques, rapidly changing DNS records to point to different servers. This can make the takedown of C2 servers more difficult since the network's entry points are constantly changing. 6. **Collaboration Requirements:** Successfully interrupting a malware's C2 communication on a large scale would likely require coordination with registrars, internet service providers (ISPs), and other members of the internet infrastructure community. 7. **Short-Lived Domains:** Malware operators sometimes only use a generated domain for a very short period before moving on to the next one, so even if researchers register some domains, the impact might be minimal. 8. **Sinkholing:** One common practice researchers use is setting up a sinkhole server for the predicted domains that the malware is expected to contact. This allows them to capture the traffic from infected hosts without actively interrupting the botnet’s activities. This data can be used for analysis and to notify affected parties, but sinkholing requires careful planning and legal consideration as well. In conclusion, while researchers can and do use reverse engineering of DGAs to combat malware, it's often a complex process that involves technical, legal, and collaborative challenges."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> struct Node { char c; int id; std::vector<Node*> next; Node() : id(-1) {} }; int main() { std::string str; std::cin >> str; Node* root = new Node(); int id = 1; Node* current = root; for (char ch : str) { bool is_found = false; for (Node* node : current->next) { if (node->c == ch) { current = node; is_found = true; break; } } if (!is_found) { Node* newNode = new Node(); newNode->c = ch; newNode->id = id++; current->next.push_back(newNode); std::cout << (current->id == -1 ? 0 : current->id) << ' ' << ch << 'n'; current = root; } } if (current != root) { std::cout << current->id << \\" n\\"; } return 0; } Сидя у себя в офисе в Калифорнии, Марк Цукерберг чуть не подавился молочным латте без лактозы, когда увидел какое количество памяти занимают картинки с добрым утром вашей бабушки в WhatsApp. В скором порядке он созвал внезапную планерку талантливейших кодировщиков со всего мира, где единогласно пришли к решению о сжатии всех картинок через алгоритм LZ78.

Для поддержки более длинных префиксов, алгоритм необходимо адаптировать, чтобы он мог запоминать последовательности символов и сравнивать их. Вот пример кода, который учитывает более длинные префиксы для алгоритма сжатия LZ78: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> #include <unordered_map> struct Node { std::unordered_map<char, Node*> next; int id; Node(int id) : id(id) {} }; int main() { std::string str; std::cin >> str; Node* root = new Node(0); int id = 1; Node* current = root; for (char ch : str) { if (current->next.find(ch) == current->next.end()) { // Если префикс + символ не найден, добавляем пару в выходные данные. std::cout << current->id << ' ' << ch << 'n'; // Добавление нового узла. current->next[ch] = new Node(id++); // Возврат к корню. current = root; } else { // Если префикс + символ найден, переходим к следующему узлу. current = current->next[ch]; } } // Если последний обработанный узел был не корень, выведем его id. if (current != root) { std::cout << current->id << \\" n\\"; } // Освобождаем память std::vector<Node*> nodes { root }; while (!nodes.empty()) { Node* node = nodes.back(); nodes.pop_back(); for (auto& child : node->next) { nodes.push_back(child.second); } delete node; } return 0; } \`\`\` Этот код использует \`unordered_map\` для удобного поиска следующего символа и поддерживает возможность обрабатывать подстроки, а не только отдельные символы. При каждом новом символе код проверяет, есть ли в текущем узле переход по этому символу. Если перехода нет, то добавляет новый узел и печатает текущий префикс и символ, после чего возвращает курсор в корень дерева. Если же переход есть, то курсор перемещается к следующему узлу и обработка продолжается. Обратите внимание, что в конце я добавил цикл для очистки памяти от созданных узлов. В вашем коде выделенная память не освобождалась, что могло привести к утечкам памяти."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> #include <unordered_map> struct Node { std::unordered_map<char, Node*> next; int id; Node(int id) : id(id) {} }; int main() { std::string str; std::cin >> str; Node* root = new Node(0); int id = 1; Node* current = root; for (char ch : str) { if (current->next.find(ch) == current->next.end()) { // Если префикс + символ не найден, добавляем пару в выходные данные. std::cout << current->id << ’ ’ << ch << ‘n’; // Добавление нового узла. current->next[ch] = new Node(id++); // Возврат к корню. current = root; } else { // Если префикс + символ найден, переходим к следующему узлу. current = current->next[ch]; } } // Если последний обработанный узел был не корень, выведем его id. if (current != root) { std::cout << current->id << \\" n\\"; } // Освобождаем память std::vector<Node*> nodes { root }; while (!nodes.empty()) { Node* node = nodes.back(); nodes.pop_back(); for (auto& child : node->next) { nodes.push_back(child.second); } delete node; } return 0; } мне нельзя использовать map вместо этого реализуй авл дерево","output":"Чтобы заменить \`std::unordered_map\`, используемую для хранения переходов в узлах, на реализацию AVL-дерева, нам потребуется реализовать структуру данных AVL-дерева с операциями вставки и поиска.

Voici une explication simplifiée de ce que chacun de ces termes représente généralement : 1. Partis libéraux : Les partis libéraux sont souvent associés à des politiques favorisant la liberté individuelle, le libre marché et une intervention limitée de l'État dans l'économie. Ils soutiennent généralement une économie de marché concurrentielle, des droits civiques étendus et une forme de gouvernement démocratique. Sur le plan social, les libéraux tendent à être progressistes, soutenant des politiques telles que l'égalité des droits pour tous, indépendamment de la race, du genre ou de l'orientation sexuelle. 2. Partis socialistes : Les partis socialistes sont orientés vers le social et l'aspect collectif de la société. Ils militent pour une distribution plus équitable des richesses, une plus grande responsabilité sociale et, souvent, des programmes de bien-être étendus financés par l'État. Les socialistes tendent à favoriser une plus grande intervention de l'État dans l'économie, comme la régulation des industries, la fourniture de services publics et la protection des travailleurs. Ils soutiennent généralement l'idée d'une société plus égalitaire avec moins de disparités économiques. 3. Partis populaires : Le terme \\"populaire\\" peut parfois être ambigu, car il est utilisé pour décrire des partis qui se concentrent sur les intérêts et préoccupations du \\"peuple\\". Le populisme peut être de gauche comme de droite. Les partis populistes se caractérisent souvent par une rhétorique qui oppose le peuple \\"pur\\" à une élite \\"corrompue\\" et peut être dirigée contre les institutions traditionnelles et l'establishment politique. Les politiques exactes des partis populistes peuvent varier considérablement et inclure des éléments de différentes idéologies, selon le contexte national et le climat politique. Il est important de noter que ces descriptions sont très générales et que les partis politiques réels peuvent varier considérablement dans leurs positions et politiques spécifiques, même s'ils s'identifient avec l'une de ces étiquettes. De plus, la manière dont ces termes sont interprétés et incarnés par les partis peut varier selon les pays et les contextes culturels. Les partis politiques évoluent également avec le temps et peuvent adapter leurs positions pour répondre aux défis et opportunités actuels."},{"instruction":"\\" la régulation des industries, la fourniture de services publics et la protection des travailleurs\\" Peux tu clarifier","output":"Bien sûr, je vais expliquer chacun de ces concepts en détail : 1. La régulation des industries : Les partis socialistes et certains partis de gauche cherchent à réguler les industries pour protéger les consommateurs, l'environnement et assurer une concurrence équitable. Ils peuvent plaider pour une législation qui impose des normes de sécurité, des régulations environnementales strictes, des contrôles sur les fusions et acquisitions pour éviter la formation de monopoles, et des mesures pour empêcher les pratiques commerciales abusives. L'objectif de la régulation est de s'assurer que les entreprises opèrent d'une manière qui soit socialement responsable et qu'elles ne profitent pas aux dépens du grand public. 2. La fourniture de services publics : Les socialistes croient en un rôle actif de l'État dans la fourniture de certains services de base que l'on considère comme des droits humains ou essentiels au bien-être public, comme la santé, l'éducation, le logement, les transports publics, et l'énergie. Ces services peuvent être fournis gratuitement ou à un coût subventionné, pour les rendre accessibles à tous, indépendamment de la capacité de payer. L'objectif est de garantir que tous les citoyens aient un accès équitable à ces services essentiels, ce qui est considéré comme un moyen de réduire les inégalités et de promouvoir une meilleure qualité de vie pour tous. 3. La protection des travailleurs : Les partis socialistes et d'autres partis de gauche se concentrent sur la protection des droits des travailleurs. Ils peuvent lutter pour un salaire minimum décent, des conditions de travail sécuritaires, le droit de former des syndicats et de négocier collectivement, ainsi que pour des heures de travail réglementées pour éviter l'exploitation. Ils peuvent également plaider pour des systèmes de protection sociale qui fournissent un soutien en cas de perte d'emploi, de maladie, ou de retraite. L'enjeu est de créer un environnement de travail juste et d'assurer une certaine sécurité économique pour les travailleurs et leurs familles. En somme, ces politiques visent à équilibrer les pouvoirs entre les employeurs et les employés, entre les grandes entreprises et les consommateurs, et entre les riches et les pauvres, en utilisant l'outil de l'État pour imposer des contrôles et des équilibres. Cela reflète une philosophie qui considère l'intervention de l'État comme nécessaire pour atteindre une justice sociale et réduire les inégalités économiques."},{"instruction":"can you explain this more clearly for me (academically and well-structured) The table you’re referring to from the Journal of Personal Selling and Sales Management outlines the relationship between strategic marketing objectives and sales strategies. Here’s an academic analysis of the table: Strategic Marketing Objectives The strategic marketing objectives are the goals that a company aims to achieve through its marketing efforts. These objectives guide the overall direction of the company’s marketing strategy and are typically categorized into three areas: Build, Harvest, and Divest. Build: This objective focuses on increasing market share, brand recognition, and customer base. It involves investing in marketing activities that promote growth and expansion. Harvest: The harvest objective aims to maximize profits from existing products or markets. It often involves reducing costs and capitalizing on the brand equity built during the ‘build’ phase. Divest: Divestment is the process of selling off or eliminating products, divisions, or assets. This objective is pursued when certain products or market segments no longer align with the company’s long-term goals or are underperforming. Sales Strategy The sales strategy is the plan of action that outlines how the sales team will support the strategic marketing objectives. It includes tactics, sales processes, and resource allocation to achieve the desired outcomes. Build: In the build phase, the sales strategy might include aggressive prospecting, offering introductory pricing, or investing in sales force training to penetrate new markets or segments. Harvest: During the harvest phase, the sales strategy could shift towards maximizing revenue from existing customers, possibly through upselling, cross-selling, or improving sales efficiency. Divest: If the objective is to divest, the sales strategy may involve liquidating stock, discontinuing sales efforts for certain products, or redirecting resources to more profitable areas.","output":"Sure, I will provide a more detailed and structured explanation of the relationship between strategic marketing objectives and sales strategies as outlined in a hypothetical table from the \\"Journal of Personal Selling and Sales Management.\\" **Strategic Marketing Objectives: An Overview** Strategic marketing objectives are the fundamental goals that a business sets to shape its marketing efforts, which are instrumental in steering the company's long-term market position. These objectives create a framework within which marketing and sales strategies operate, ensuring that tactical decisions support the broader corporate vision. The objectives commonly fall into three categories: Build, Harvest, and Divest, each representing the life-cycle stage of a product or a market presence. 1. **Build:** This objective concentrates on growth dynamics. The company seeks to enhance its market share, elevate the prominence of its brand, and broaden its customer base. The aim is to invest sufficiently in marketing initiatives that enhance awareness and draw in new customers, thereby setting the stage for long-term profitability and sustainability. 2. **Harvest:** Once the investments made during the building stage mature, the Harvest objective comes into play. This stage is about optimizing profits from the existing portfolio of products and services. It often involves refining cost structures, making processes more efficient, and leveraging the existing customer relationships fostered during the build phase to increase sales. 3. **Divest:** The divestment strategy is employed when specific products, services, or business units no longer align with the overarching strategic goals or fail to deliver expected results. It involves the re-allocation or liquidation of assets, and the divestment of non-core segments, allowing the business to concentrate resources on more lucrative or strategically-important areas. **Sales Strategy: The Tactical Execution** In contrast to marketing objectives, a sales strategy consists of the detailed planning and tactics that enable the salesforce to contribute to these strategic objectives. Each phase (Build, Harvest, Divest) influences the nature of the sales approach, with activities tailored to support the current strategic focus. 1. **Build Strategy:** Sales strategies in this phase are characterized by proactive outreach and engagement. Sales representatives are likely to pursue aggressive lead generation and customer acquisition tactics, employ introductory offers, and partake in extensive sales training to better understand and penetrate new markets. High levels of customer support and post-sale engagement may also feature prominently to solidify initial customer relationships. 2. **Harvest Strategy:** At this juncture, the sales strategy becomes more about reaping the rewards of established relationships and market presence. Sales efforts may pivot to focus on upselling or cross-selling to existing clients, optimizing the sales cycle for efficiency, and tapping into existing brand loyalty to support premium pricing strategies. In essence, the salesforce seeks to maximize revenue from the customer base built during the build phase. 3. **Divest Strategy:** When the company enters a divestment period, the sales strategy undergoes significant change. Resources are drawn away from the products or markets earmarked for divestment. This often means reducing or completely cutting sales support for those areas. Instead, efforts concentrate on liquidating existing stocks, minimizing losses, and restructuring the salesforce to align with new priorities or growth areas elsewhere in the portfolio. In summary, the strategic marketing objectives outline the desired direction and priorities of a business, while the sales strategy provides the roadmap for the sales team to execute these objectives effectively. Each affects the other, and their alignment is critical to the company’s success."},{"instruction":"Нужен cmd скрипт, при запуске которого компьютер каждые 5 секунд будет обращаться к адресу https://hosteagle.club/forum/t7413.html?__cpo=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmZvcnVtLm9yZw#post459951 и выводить информацию об IP сервера.","output":"Чтобы создать такой скрипт для Windows, вы можете использовать команду \`ping\` для получения IP-адреса и команду \`timeout\` для паузы между запросами.

Examining Hong Kong's New Parental Incentives As a Hong Kong student, one can’t help but notice the chatter among adults about the difficulty of raising a family here. Our bustling city has been facing a pressing issue: people aren't having as many babies. But recently, our Chief Executive John Lee has sketched out a vision that aims to cheer parents up - with cash bonuses and housing priorities up his sleeve, he’s hoping to hear more baby giggles around town. Deep down, we all know our city's birth rate isn't just low; it's hitting record lows. That's why the government's dishing out what they're calling the 'Newborn Baby Bonus'. It's like a \\"welcome to the world\\" gift from the city to the tiniest new Hongkongers. They're also promising to lift the roof (not literally!) on the tax deductions for families who’ve just added a tiny member. And for those who worry about squeezing into their homes with an extra crib, the Hong Kong Housing Authority is on the move to prioritize these growing families in getting housing. But will all this really make more couples want to start or grow their families? Money and a roof over your head are great, but are they enough? Having a baby is a big responsibility, and many couples in Hong Kong hesitate for reasons that might not disappear even with these incentives. Firstly, there's the cost of living, which, let's face it, is sky-high here. Even with extra cash in hand, the price tag on raising a child can make anyone's bank account shiver. Then there's the work pressure. Many of us might have heard our parents talk about long hours and tough competition. When you're already stretched thin, the thought of adding diaper duties can seem overwhelming. Education is another biggie. We students might know all too well the race for a spot at a good school, and our parents worry about this way before we even hit our first birthday. And don't forget about finding space. Sure, priority for housing sounds nice, but with waiting lists like those for a concert of a K-pop superstar, one's got to wonder how much of a difference it’ll really make. Improving the situation might need a tad more than just bonuses and housing promises. We need a culture that supports working parents, like more flexible job hours and better childcare options. Schools that don't require a battle royale to enter would be cool too. Maybe what we need is a city that not only makes it easier to have a baby but a city that's genuinely a better place for families. That's a Hong Kong I'd be proud to call home—and I’m sure the little ones would agree. So, while the government's efforts seem like a step in the right direction, it's also up to us—as the future generation—to keep thinking about how we can build a more family-friendly Hong Kong. It's not just about babies; it's about building a home where families can thrive. #FamilyFriendlyHK #ForABetterHome"},{"instruction":"As Chief Executive John Lee laid out his Policy Address priorities, he announced that the Government will offer a one-off cash bonus, provide priority access to housing and raise the tax-deduction ceiling for families with newborns in its quest to promote fertility and create a pro-childbearing environment.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive, John Lee, has tell everyone his plans. In the Policy Address, he said the government will give a one-time cash money to families when they have a new baby. They will also get to have a home faster and pay less tax. This idea is to help families and make them want to have more children. Now I will think about this - Will these new plans really help people decide to have babies? It's hard to say for sure. Yes, getting money and finding a place to live easier can help. But there are big problems that just giving money or a house won't fix. People here are worried about many things before they want to start a family. One of the reasons why couples don't want babies is because everything cost a lot. Even with the extra help from the government, having a child is expensive. Parents need to spend a lot of money on many things for the kids to grow up good and happy. Also, parents have to work many hours here. There's so much pressure to work all the time, and adding taking care of a child can be too much for them. School is another worry. Every parent wants their kid to go to the best school, but these schools are so hard to get in. And houses in Hong Kong are really small. Yes, the government says they will make it faster to get a house, but will the houses be big enough or in the right place? Who knows. To make it better, we need things that go beyond money and houses. For example, if jobs let parents have more flexible time, it would be easier for them to take care of their children. Good nurseries or kindergartens can also help a lot so parents don't have to stress so much. So, the government's plans sound good, but there is still a long way to make Hong Kong a great place for families to grow bigger. We still need to think and do many things. I hope that we can all help to make ideas that will really make Hong Kong good for families. Because at the end of the day, it's not only the number of babies that's important. It's about making a home where families can live happily. So, when I think about these questions, I hope the new plans will help a little bit. But it's also up to us, the young people, to keep thinking and working for a Hong Kong that's the best place for all families. #FamiliesFirst #HongKongFuture"},{"instruction":"can you add more Grammy mistake or other mistake let it not like writing by a ai","output":"Title: Can more babies come with new policy?

He explained that because Hong Kong's birth rate remains at its lowest level, apart from handing out the Newborn Baby Bonus, raising the accommodation-related tax deduction ceiling for families with newborns, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) plans to introduce schemes designed to assist such families. Support families with newborns Mr Lee said: \\"We will provide a one-off cash bonus of 20,000 for each baby born today or after in Hong Kong to a parent who is a Hong Kong Permanent Resident. \\"Starting from the year of assessment 2024-25, we will raise the deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic rents from the current 100,000 to 120,000, an increase of 20%, for taxpayers who live with his/her first child born today or after until the child reaches the age of 18. \\"The HKHA will introduce the \\"Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme to raise the chances for families with newborns to purchase SSFs. Starting from the HOS sale exercise next year, a quota of flats will be reserved for balloting and priority flat selection by family applicants with babies born today or after until the children reach the age of three. In each of the HOS or GSH sale exercise, an additional 10% of the total number of flats will be reserved for the purpose of selection priority. \\"The HKHA will introduce the \\"Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme\\" to advance the allocation of PRH flats for families with newborns.

This arrangement will take effect from next April.\\"Support assisted reproductive services Noting that some couples may need assisted reproductive techio sery io conceive a baby, the Got thent will enhance support by increasing the public service quota for assisted reproductive services and offering a tax deduction for such expenses, Mir Lee pointed out, *Over the next five years from 2024-25 to 2028-29, the Hospital Authority CHA) will gradually increase the assisted reproductive service quota for in-vitro fortilisation (VF) treatment by more than 60%, from 1 100 treatment cycles per year to 1 800 treatment cycles per year. \\"Starting from the year of assessment 2024/25, the Government will provide a deduction for expenses on assisted reproductive services under salaries tax and personal assessment, subject to a ceiling of 100,000 a year.\\" Additionally, the Chief Executive emphasised that strengthening support for working families in childbearing and unleashing their labour force is equally important. Assist working families in childbearing He stated that besides increasing the Working Family Allowance, the Government will increase child care centre places and allowances and extend an after-school care programme aimed at covering all districts. \\"Starting from next April, the household and child allowances under the Working Family Allowance Scheme will increase by 15% to alleviate their burden. \\"Over the next three years starting from 2024, 10 more aided standalone child care centres will be set up in phases, providing about 900 additional places for day child care services. \\"Over the next three years starting from 2024, the After-School Care Programme for Pre-primary Children will be extended in phases to cover all districts in Hong Kong. The number of participating centres will be increased from 16 to 28, and the number of service places from about 670 to nearly 1,200.\\" Mr Lee added that a five-year Funding Scheme on the Promotion of Family Education will be launched in the latter half of next year to support community projects promoting family education. Boost Birth Rate Except for 2021, Hong Kong's economy shrank in 2019, 2020 and last year. Even if this year's real gross domestic product growth met the government's forecast of 4 to 5 per cent, the full-year economic output of 2023 would still fall short of that in 2018, said government economist Adolph Leung Wing-sing. On the social front, the city's fertility rate sank to the lowest on record, leading to calls for the government to do more to encourage couples to have babies. What can Lee offer on October 25 to shake off some of the pessimism, press on with his policies and raise Hongkongers' sense that the city is on the right track? Political scientist Sonny Lo Shiu-hing said that with the slow recovery since the city reopened to the world, Hongkongers' expectations of the chief executive had changed compared with this time last year. Hong Kong leader says he will look at public's ideas on ways to boost birth rate 20 Aug 2023 \\"Back then it was about meeting Beijing's aspirations of making Hong Kong more stable, it was about national security and social stability, and he's done that. Now it's about advancing to prosperity, and he has to do more, \\" he said. While the pressure mounts on Lee to act, the public coffers at his disposal have been depleting. The government recorded a deficit of HK139.8 billion (US17.9 billion) in the 2022-23 financial year, with a further deficit of HK54.4 billion anticipated for the current one. The fiscal reserves stood at HK698.6 billion as of August, nearly two-fifths lower than four years ago. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant at the semi-official think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Lee had a tough job as economic hardship would continue to eat into government revenues. Urging the city leader to \\"bite the bullet\\", he said the priorities should be policies and projects geared towards long-term development and people desperately in need. \\"Some guidelines must be reviewed to reflect the government's new priorities,\\" he said. \\"Some overly generous measures might have to be reconsidered, such as the extension of the HK2 fare subsidy to people aged between 60 and 64.\\" Given the \\"grave economic situation in the coming years\\", the government would have to tap more into community resources to achieve public ends, he said. Hong Kong in need of hope if birth rate is to rise With the number of marriages and babies born plummeting, the government should instil confidence in the public and provide more incentives to raise children With the Covid-19 pandemic still gripping Hong Kong, it is hardly surprising that people are putting back marriage and birth plans. Temporary as it may be, the phenomenon has implications on population and public services in the longer term. Indeed, the trend, aggravated by high living costs and political and economic gloom, emerged long before the onslaught of the coronavirus. It should be addressed in the wider context of social development by the new government. Even without the on-and-off restrictions on wedding banquets over the past 2½ years, it would take the most eager couple to tie the knot under the prevailing atmosphere. The crude marriage rate - the number of marriages per 1,000 in the population - hit 30-year lows of 6.7 for women and 8.0 for men last year. Why John Lee's baby bonus is fool's gold for Hong Kong Immigration rather than birth rates drives Hong Kong's population, and the goverment should look to migrant flows for solutions to our demographic woes Besides, the one-off cash handout misses many of the underlying factors driving Hongkongers not to have children David Dodwell Published: 9:30am, 30 Oct, 2023 Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu prides himself in being \\"result-oriented\\", and the 171-point development blueprint elaborated in last week's policy address provides a massive list of initiatives on which results will be expected. One initiative in particular should be quick and easy to measure: his one-off, HK20,000 (US2,500) cash handout for every child born between now and October 2026. But behind the clear commitment to child-bearing mothers, questions arise over his government's strategic aim and whether a HK20,000 handout is in any credible way the best way of achieving it. I presume Lee's strategic intent is to reverse long-standing demographic change. In our rapidly ageing society, he fears the challenging burden that will be borne by a shrinking working-age population and hopes we can persuade women to have babies in much larger numbers. For example, the year to mid-2023 saw just 32,600 babies born in Hong Kong but more than 54,000 deaths. Our population is shrinking even as the cost of supporting our retired elderly is rising sharply. But Lee is misdescribing our problem and prescribing an inappropriate and ineffective solution. First, Hong Kong's population problem has never been - and will never be - driven by birth rates. Second, the demographic imbalance only exists if you assume Hong Kong is regarded as a self-contained economy rather than an integral part of the Greater Bay Area. Third, a HK20,000 handout misses by a mile the real reasons Hong Kong couples are in large numbers opting not to have and raise children. On the first issue, I recall a fascinating 1975 article by Saw Swee-Hock in Singapore and Chiu Wing Kin at the University of Hong Kong, tracking Hong Kong's population from 1841: \\"The course and components of population growth in the past 130 years or so have been influenced by the ebb and flow of people in response to conditions on the mainland.\\" What was true then is equally true 48 years later. Hong Kong's population today is the product of three massive migratory movements: a large influx of people between 1945 and 1951 as a civil war raged in China; a second influx between 1978 and 1980 at the end of the Cultural Revolution; and a third influx that began in earnest under China's 150-person-a-day \\"one-way permit scheme\\", which allowed \\"family reunions\\" mainly between Hong Kong husbands and mainland wives. According to a research paper published by the Legislative Council Secretariat in 2020, more than a million mainlanders have arrived in Hong Kong under the scheme from 1997 to 2018, accounting for about 13 per cent of the population then. They were mainly uneducated, poor and living in public rental housing. They accounted for about one third of local marriages, and between 2006 and 2012 mainland women accounted for between 40 and 46 per cent of all children born in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Update Newsletter Our weekly round-up of the best news, stories and opinion from Hong Kong. Even in the past three years, it has been migrant flows that drive Hong Kong's demographic challenges. And if it is migrant flows that have been driving Hong Kong's demographics, then it should be as part of the Greater Bay Area that our demographic challenges should be analysed. People visit a shopping complex in Shenzhen's Baoan district on August 6. If it is migrant flows that have been driving Hong Kong's demographics, then it should be as part of the Greater Bay Area that our demographic challenges should be analysed. Photo: Dickson Lee If even a small proportion of the mainland women who have arrived in Hong Kong over the past two decades decide to retire back in the Greater Bay Area, then a modest uptick in Hong Kong's local birth rate will be wholly inconsequential. We might still have a demographic problem, but it is shaped by forces that have nothing to do with delivering a few more local babies. This takes us to the third point - the HK20,000 handout to new mothers misses the underlying causes of Hong Kong's low birth rate and will have no impact on incentivising an uptick. In an infographic in the Post back in July 2016, Lau Ka-kuen and Dan Bland took three groups - high net worth families, middle-class families and lower-income families - and compared the cost of raising a child to the age of 21. Raising a child in competitive Hong Kong is just exhausting 22 Aug 2023 In short, the rich families on average spend about HK14.2 million getting their child through to university graduation, a middle-class family spends about HK7 million and a lower-income family spends about HK2.6 million. Most local couples know the numbers. One-off payments are insufficient. As newly married Michelle Lee said, such sweeteners \\"will not help me with a responsibility that I will have for the rest of my life\\". Hong Kong halves buyer's stamp duty for non-residents as part of measures to boost economy Neither will they address the challenge of raising a family in an average-sized 480 sq ft Hong Kong flat. In comparison, the average-sized home in Singapore is about 800 sq ft, 720 sq ft in Shanghai and 760 sq ft in Shenzhen. If Lee is serious about incentivising bigger families, he will start by making a decent-sized home affordable for the average Hong Kong family. I offer one final thought on this inept plan. If we take last year's 32,600 babies as a benchmark, then just keeping the birth rate at the current level is going to cost an annual HK652 million. If by some miracle this incentive doubled the coming year's birth rate, producing an additional 32,600 new babies, this would cost HK1.30 billion. This is in a context where migrant fluxes could reach more than 100,000 a year. If our \\"result-oriented\\" chief executive is truly serious about tackling our demographic challenges, he will look at migration flows. His HK20,000 handout is spitting in the wind, and he knows that as well as I do. Hong Kong policy address 2023: will priority access to housing for couples with newborns help boost birth rate more than cash handouts? Population health professor Paul Yip says housing incentive will be much more successful way to encourage childbirth than handing out one-off cash allowance Chief Executive John Lee expected to unveil new incentives to help boost birth rate in his policy address next week, with HK20,000 handouts possible A policy address proposal under consideration by Hong Kong leader John Lee Ka-chiu to help boost the city's birth rate by giving couples with newborns priority for subsidised housing has sparked concerns over its effectiveness and fairness. The measure, similar to a Singapore scheme, was revealed by sources on Friday as the chief executive ironed out the details for his second policy address, to be delivered \\"It would provide them a more stable living environment,\\" an insider said The Post reported earlier that incentives to boost the birth rate would be a highlight of Lee's speech and that the government would not rule out giving cash to couples who had a newborn. The amount could reach HK20,000 (US2,555), some reports suggested. Housing policies at present only give priority to families with elderly members. Under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS), which sells subsidised flats, the Housing Authority sets a quota of homes for family applicants with older members. Eligible applicants are given priority on flat selection. Out of 9,154 flats sold in July, about 2,700 were reserved for the extended family category. A similar plan, the Harmonious Families Priority Scheme, is used to allocate public rental flats. The programme also gives priority to families with elderly members. Eligible families may opt to live in the same flat or two homes close to each other. Up to 60 per cent of the public flat supply in Singapore is reserved for first-time married couples with children and young wedded couples under its Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme. Couples with a doctor's certificate to confirm pregnancy are also eligible.What can Hong Kong do to reverse its low birth rate? We look at proposals from extending sperm and embryo storage to even universal suffrage Number of childless couples has doubled in five years, according to Family Planning Association survey Proposals raised include allowing organisations to provide arranged surrogacy services and increasing the child allowance Hong Kong's struggle with a low birth rate is back in the spotlight after the latest census data suggested the number of babies born between June last year and June this year had continued to drop - at a mere 32,600 from 35,100 in the preceding 12 months. The government also projected the birth rate to remain low in the coming decades, counting on foreign labour imports and overseas talent recruitment as the main drivers of population. A latest survey by the Family Planning Association found that the number of childless couples had doubled in five years while the average number of children born per couple also dropped to a record low of 0.9. Childless Hong Kong couples double in 5 years as births drop below 1 per family 15 Aug 2023 Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has promised to consider public suggestions on ways to boost the birth rate. The Post takes a closer look at proposals raised by political parties and experts: 1. Prolonging storage of eggs, sperm and embryos New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, also convenor of the key decision-making Executive Council which advises the city's leader, proposed to lengthen the permitted storage period for eggs, sperm and embryos from 10 to 55 years. • There is no real demand for lengthening the storage period of eggs, sperm and embryos to more than 10 years.

But reproductive medicine experts in the city described the proposal as \\"unrealistic and not suitable for Hong Kong\\" Professor Emest Ng Hung-yu, former head of the division of reproductive medicine at Queen Mary Hospital, said the longer timespan would have little effect because there was no real demand for a storage period of more than 10 years. Hong Kong expert: longer storage for reproductive material will not boost births 19 Aug 2023 He explained that most people who stored reproductive material would use them within four years. 2. Allow organisations to provide arranged surrogacy services Ip's party also suggested the government consider allowing local eligible organisations to provide surrogacy services to couples in need. Hong Kong's Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance prohibits commercial surrogacy and forbids couples to use donated eggs or those of surrogates. There are at present 12 public and 24 private healthcare institutions licensed to offer reproductive services. But none of them are allowed to provide surrogacy arrangements. Commercial surrogacy is prohibited in Hong Kong. Photo: Elson Li Ip said laws in the city covering the use of reproductive technology were very restrictive, hence preventing many women who are not physically able to receive in vitro fertilisation treatment from having their babies. While admitting that allowing commercial surrogacy would give rise to ethical problems, Ip argued it was practical to review the current restriction and allow couples to turn to surrogate mothers using eggs and sperm not necessarily their own. 3. More child allowance • The Liberal Party proposed introducing a progressive child allowance mechanism to encourage parents to give birth. She said she took reference from Britain, and such a plan would offer \\"more flexibiliy» for couples to give birth.

Extend maternity leave The Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest labour union, proposed extending maternity leave from the current 14 weeks to 16 weeks. It also suggested extra days of maternity leave could be given to mothers who gave birth to more than one child. For example, an additional 15 days of leave could be granted for each additional baby born. An extra 15 days of maternity leave should be given to women who experienced difficult labour or needed caesarean sections, the Federation of Trade Unions suggests. Photo: Xiaomei Chen For those who experienced difficult labour or needed caesarean sections, an extra 15 days of maternity leave should also be added to allow women more time to recover, it said. The union also suggested that women aged between 24 and 29 could receive an additional 60 days of maternity leave to motivate residents to give birth earlier. 5. Implement universal suffrage Hong Kong's only centrist lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen and his Third Side Party took a very different approach to addressing the population crisis. He argued that without a democratic system, young people lacked confidence in the future of society. They would then be unwilling to bring perceived hardship onto the next generation, he argued. Experts push for urgent action as more Hongkongers say they 'don't need a baby' 18 May 2023 Tik's party called on the chief executive to implement universal suffrage based on the dubbed \\"831 [August 31] framework\\", which would allow all residents to cast votes based on a pool of candidates screened by the central government, instead of the current closed-circle balloting. 6. More affordable housing University of Hong Kong population health expert Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai noted that all of the proposals raised so far would have minimal impact. He argued that women would only be encouraged to marry and give birth early if there was support for housing, finance and education. For housing, he suggested the government craft subsidised housing specifically for young married couples, promising them conditions conducive for having children. According to Yip, the administration could also consider monthly cash allowances for couples who gave birth, until their children reach a certain age. As Chief Executive John Lee laid out his Policy Address priorities, he announced that the Government will offer a one-off cash bonus, provide priority access to housing and raise the tax-deduction ceiling for families with newborns in its quest to promote fertility and create a pro-childbearing environment. He explained that because Hong Kong's birth rate remains at its lowest level, apart from handing out the Newborn Baby Bonus, raising the accommodation-related tax deduction ceiling for families with newborns, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) plans to introduce schemes designed to assist such families.

That's like, really trying to get people to have more kids, right? First, Mr. Lee said each baby born's gonna get a 20,000 cash bonus, which is kinda a lot of money just for being born. Plus, if your family has a first child, you get to pay less for your home loans or rents—sounds like a good deal, huh? But, they're also gonna sort out flat picking for families with new little ones. It's like, if you have a baby, you pick a home faster. That could be cool for many. But wait, how much is this really gonna work to make people wanna have more babies? Everyone chatting around says the bonus is nice, but having a baby is a big deal, more than just getting cash and a new flat. I think the new policy is kinda cool, but not enough. So why don't couples hurry up to have kids here in Hong Kong? You might have heard your parents jabber on about it. It's super expensive to raise a child here, like, you gotta be ready to spend tons of money from birth to university. Then there's finding a good school—everyone wants their kid to be the best, and that's some stiff competition. Plus, people gotta work like all the time, often bringing their job stress home. I guess they think adding a baby to all that could be too much. To give you an idea, imagine trying to manage a carrom board game, but now you’ve got a squishy, crying baby at the board with you. It's not just about extra moves; now you gotta make sure the baby doesn't eat the pieces! And let's not forget about homes. I mean, we're already living all squished up, so even if they help us get houses quicker, are they gonna be bigger or still the tight squeeze we're used to? Plus, you have to wait for like, forever.

Our Chief Executive, John Lee, just announced something big. In his Policy Address, he said the government is gonna give out cash and help with housing for families who have a baby. They're pushing for more kids in Hong Kong. Now, here's the deal. Each newborn is getting a 20,000 cash bonus—that's a nice chunk of change! If you've just had your first child, you can even get a cut on your home loans or rent. And if you need a flat, having a baby means you'll get to pick one quicker. Though, I gotta wonder, is this really gonna convince more people to have babies? Everybody's talking. The bonus is great, but having a baby? It's huge. It's more than just money or a place to live. This policy is a good start, but it might not be enough. Why are couples in Hong Kong not rushing to have kids? Costs. It's really expensive to raise a child here—all the way from diapers to diplomas. And schools? The competition's fierce. Everyone wants the best for their kids. Then there's the work—people here work non-stop. Adding a baby to that mix sounds pretty overwhelming, doesn't it? Think about it this way. Imagine playing a game but now add a wriggling, crying baby in the mix. You've got more to worry about than just your next move, right? And our flats, they're already packed tight. Even if we choose flats faster, will there be enough room? It feels like we're always waiting. So, what's really gonna improve things? Breaks would be good. Jobs need to get that parents could use more flexible hours. Dependable childcare would make a world of difference. If we had that kind of support, having kids might seem less daunting. Okay, one-off cash and quicker housing is something, but it doesn't get to the heart of the challenge. It's way more complex than just handing out cash when a baby arrives. But who knows, maybe this will make a bit of a difference. Raising a child isn't just about running to the hospital; it's about creating a home where families have space to grow. Let's see what happens. If our city turns into a place that feels right for families, maybe more of us will see having kids in Hong Kong as a pretty good plan."},{"instruction":"Questo progetto è un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario che consente agli utenti di ottenere informazioni rilevanti sugli orari dei treni, verificare se sono puntuali o in ritardo e conoscere l'orario di arrivo in una stazione specifica e il numero di binario. Il sistema può tracciare l'orario di partenza di un treno da una stazione e inoltrare queste informazioni alle stazioni successive. Il Treno inoltre fornisce informazioni sugli orari dei treni in tempo reale a diverse applicazioni client sottoscritte. Questo sistema di tracciamento prevede che inizialmente un Admin inserisca l’orario stagionale dei treni che comprende tutti i dettagli rilevanti sui treni e i loro orari di arrivo e partenza dalle diverse stazioni. Il sistema controlla che tutte le stazioni abbiano la capienza necessaria ad ospitare tutti i treni in sosta, altrimenti segnala il problema per chiedere una modifica all’orario. Inoltre, gli amministratori possono aggiungere informazioni temporanee come: treni speciali, treni soppressi o fermate cancellate per lavori sulla linea. Fra i dettagli rilevanti sui treni occorre tener conto del codice identificativo univoco, dello stato (in manutenzione o in servizio), della tipologia (Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte), del numero vagoni, della capienza passeggeri. Fra i dettagli per ogni viaggio di ciascun treno occorre conoscere la partenza e la destinazione con gli orari programmati e quelli effettivi, nonché le stazioni intermedie con i tempi di sosta e gli eventuali ritardi/anticipi.

Qui di seguito sono elencate alcune possibili gerarchie: 1. **Gerarchia Utenti**: - Utente (l'entità base per tutti gli utenti) - Admin (l'amministratore che gestisce gli orari e i dettagli dei treni) - Capostazione (responsabile della segnalazione di arrivi e partenze dei treni nella stazione) - Utente Registrato (un cliente che potrebbe ricevere aggiornamenti personalizzati) - Utente Temporaneo (un cliente che utilizza il sistema senza creare un account) 2. **Gerarchia Treni**: - Treno (la base di tutti i tipi di treno) - Frecce (categoria di treni veloci, ad esempio Frecciarossa, Frecciargento) - Intercity (treni che collegano città importanti con fermate meno frequenti) - Intercity Notte (treni Intercity che operano nel turno di notte) 3. **Gerarchia Viaggi**: - Viaggio (l'entità rappresentante un singolo viaggio di un treno) - Viaggio Programmato (orari e rotte previsti nel planning) - Viaggio Effettivo (orari e rotte effettivi, comprensivi di ritardi, cambi di binario, ecc.) 4. **Gerarchia Stazioni**: - Stazione (l'entità base per tutte le stazioni) - Stazione con Deposito (stazioni che includono depositi per la manutenzione dei treni) - Stazione Principale (stile hub, con numerosi binari e connessioni) - Stazione Secondaria (più piccola, con servizi ridotti) 5. **Gerarchia Indennità**: - Indennità (base per i tipi di indennità) - Indennità per Ritardo Minore (per ritardi di durata inferiore, esclusi dal rimborso) - Indennità per Ritardo Major (per ritardi significativi che richiedono rimborsi) Ciascuna di queste entità potrebbe avere i rispettivi attributi e relazioni con altre entità. Per esempio, un \`Treno\` avrebbe un codice identificativo, uno stato, un numero di vagoni, una capienza passeggeri, ecc., mentre la relazione con \`Viaggio\` descriverebbe i dettagli di ciascun viaggio, partenza, arrivo, stazioni intermedie, tempi di sosta e ritardi/anticipi. Inoltre, possono essere stilate relazioni tra entità come, per esempio, associazioni fra \`Admin\` e \`Orario stagionale\`, relazioni di tracciamento fra \`Viaggio\` e \`Stazione\`, comunicazioni fra \`Capostazione\` e \`Treno\` ogni volta che vi è una variazione degli orari o dei binari, e così via. Si noti che il modello concettuale finale potrebbe essere più complesso e articolato a seconda delle esigenze specifiche del sistema e delle funzionalità che si desidera implementare."},{"instruction":"Ma nel modello concettuale ha senso mettere gli utenti? non capisco come avrei bisogno di memorizzarli in un database?","output":"Hai ragione; nella realizzazione di un modello concettuale per un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario, gli utenti finali del servizio (come passeggeri o clienti che verificano gli orari) potrebbero non essere una componente critica del database, se il focus è solamente sulla logistica e il funzionamento del sistema di trasporto. Tipicamente, gli utenti diventano rilevanti nel modello se il sistema deve gestire account personalizzati, preferenze, cronologia di viaggi, acquisti di biglietti, interazioni con il servizio clienti, e così via. Nel contesto fornito, sembra che gli \\"utenti\\" menzionati siano più funzionali al sistema (come Admin o Capostazione) piuttosto che clienti o passeggeri. Questi ruoli di sistema potrebbero necessitare di essere rappresentati nel database per gestire autenticazione, autorizzazioni, o tracciamento di azioni e modifiche al sistema. Per il sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario di cui parli, le entità principali pertinenti sarebbero: 1. **Entità Treno**: memorizza i dettagli sui treni, come il codice identificativo univoco, lo stato, la tipologia, il numero di vagoni e la capienza passeggeri. 2. **Entità Viaggio**: rappresenta il percorso di un treno, con informazioni come partenza, destinazione, orari programmati ed effettivi, e dettagli sulle fermate intermedie. 3. **Entità Stazione**: include informazioni specifiche per ogni stazione, come la capienza dei binari e le strutture disponibili. 4. **Entità Evento Viaggio**: tiene traccia degli eventi del viaggio come partenze e arrivi, inclusi eventuali ritardi e variazioni di binario. 5. **Entità Indennità**: rappresenta le compensazioni dovute per ritardi, suddivise per fascia di durata e tipologia di treno. 6. **Entità Orario Stagionale**: un insieme di orari pianificati per i vari treni in servizio durante una stagione. 7. **Entità Manutenzione**: track dei treni sotto manutenzione, se rilevante per il funzionamento complessivo. Le relazioni fra queste entità potrebbero includere collegamenti tra i treni e i loro specifici viaggi, tra i viaggi e le stazioni, e tra gli eventi di viaggio e le indennità previste per ritardi. Non memorizzare gli utenti nel database ha senso se il loro ruolo non influisce direttamente sulle operazioni dei treni e sulla gestione delle stazioni. In generale, i modelli concettuali sono progettati per rappresentare gli aspetti fondamentali ed essenziali di una base di dati, e dovrebbero riflettere le necessità informative del sistema da modellare."},{"instruction":"Avrebbe senso allora fare una gerarchia per ritardi compresi e ritardi superiori","output":"In un modello concettuale per un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario, potrebbe avere senso organizzare le informazioni sui ritardi in una gerarchia solo se ci sono diverse caratteristiche o azioni associate a diverse fasce di ritardo. Se il sistema di indennità varia in modo sostanziale in base alla fascia di ritardo, ad esempio se variano i processi di calcolo dell’indennità o le procedure amministrative, una gerarchia di ritardi potrebbe aiutare a modellare queste differenze. Per esempio, si potrebbe avere una gerarchia per l'entità Ritardo come segue: - **Ritardo** - **Ritardo Minore**: per ritardi da 0 a 29 minuti, potrebbe non essere prevista indennità o potrebbero essere previste azioni di segnalazione minori. - **Ritardo Moderato**: per ritardi da 30 a 59 minuti, con indennità e azioni specifiche associate a questa fascia. - **Ritardo Esteso**: per ritardi di oltre 59 minuti, con differenti livelli di indennità e altre possibili procedure, come notifiche speciali ai passeggeri o interventi correttivi. Questa gerarchia sarebbe pertinente se ci sono logiche o regole di business chiaramente distinte che devono essere applicate in base alla durata del ritardo. Se, ad esempio, le regole relative all'indennità sono molto diverse tra ritardi minori e ritardi maggiori, modellare queste come classi separate può semplificare il processo di gestione dei dati e l'applicazione delle regole. Tuttavia, se la differenza tra i ritardi si riduce semplicemente a parametri diversi (come l'importo dell'indennità) all'interno dello stesso processo generale, allora potrebbe essere sufficiente una singola entità Ritardo con un attributo che indichi la fascia di ritardo. Le regole specifiche relative all'importo dell'indennità o altre azioni conseguenti possono essere gestite attraverso la logica dell'applicazione o query specifiche. In linea di principio, la creazione di una gerarchia nel modello concettuale dipende dalla complessità e dalle esigenze specifiche del sistema e dal modo in cui il dominio del problema viene interpretato e organizzato."},{"instruction":"Questo progetto è un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario che consente agli utenti di ottenere informazioni rilevanti sugli orari dei treni, verificare se sono puntuali o in ritardo e conoscere l’orario di arrivo in una stazione specifica e il numero di binario.

Ecco come potrebbe essere strutturata la gerarchia delle indennità: - **Entità Indennità** (generica per tutti i tipi di compensazione a seguito di ritardi) - **Indennità per Ritardo Minore**: riguarda i ritardi minori, i quali potrebbero non qualificarsi per una compensazione, ma che potrebbero comunque essere registrati nel sistema. - **Indennità per Ritardo Compreso**: questa entità gestirebbe le compensazioni per ritardi entro un certo intervallo, es. da 30 a 59 minuti per alcune categorie di treni, come le Frecce. - **Indennità per Ritardo Superiore**: gestirebbe le compensazioni per ritardi superiori a un certo limite, es. oltre i 59 minuti per treni Frecce, Intercity, e Intercity Notte. Questa gerarchia consente di gestire in modo distinto la logica e le regole associate a ciascun intervallo di ritardo. Per esempio, diversi livelli di indennizzo potrebbero essere applicati in base alla durata del ritardo, e le regole per determinare l'importo dell'indennizzo potrebbero essere diverse per ogni livello. Il sistema traccierebbe l'entità del ritardo e quindi associerebbe l'indennizzo corretto a seconda della categoria specifica. Inoltre, la storicità degli incidenti e degli indennizzi potrebbe essere utilizzata per analisi di tendenza, rapporti interni, o per miglioramenti dei servizi. Per implementare questa gerarchia nel tuo database, devi assicurarti che ogni indennità mantenga i riferimenti necessari per identificare il treno, il viaggio, la fascia oraria interessata, e qualsiasi altro dettaglio rilevante per il calcolo e la reportistica delle indennità.

Inoltre memorizza ritardo ed eventuale nuovo binario per interrogazioni via web e informa le applicazioni client sottoscritte., Quando i ritardi superano una certa soglia che dipende dalla tipologia del treno, il sistema deve memorizzare un’indennità: sono previste indennità per ritardi compresi, ad esempio, tra 30 e 59 minuti per le Frecce e indennità per ritardo superiore, per esempio, ai 59 minuti per i treni Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte. Si noti che il sistema deve consentire la memorizzazione dello storico delle indennità per ogni tipologia di treno e per ogni fascia oraria.","output":"All'interno di un modello concettuale per il sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario che hai descritto, le relazioni tra la gerarchia dei treni (Frecce, Intercity, Intercity Notte) e le entità per le soglie di ritardo e le indennità possono essere costruite come segue: 1. **Entità Treno**: Questa è l'entità superiore che include attributi comuni a tutti i treni, come il codice identificativo, lo stato, il numero di vagoni e la capienza passeggeri. - **Sottoclassi**: - Frecce - Intercity - Intercity Notte La relazione tra l'entità Treno e le sue sottoclassi è una relazione di tipo *is-a*, indicando che ciascuna sottoclasse è un caso particolare di Treno. 2. **Entità Soglia di Ritardo**: Questa entità rappresenta i diversi parametri di ritardo che impattano il calcolo delle indennità. Potresti avere attributi come \`Minimo\` e \`Massimo\` per definire i range di tempo, e un identificatore di soglia. 3. **Entità Indennità**: Questa entità tiene traccia delle compensazioni dovute ai passeggeri a seguito dei ritardi. Include informazioni come l'importo dell'indennità, il tipo di indennità e riferimenti sia al viaggio che al tipo di treno. Le relazioni chiave nel modello concettuale possono essere strutturate come segue: - Una **relazione tra Viaggio e Treno**: ogni viaggio è associato a un treno specifico. - Una **relazione tra Viaggio e Stazione**: per tenere traccia di dove avvengono partenze e arrivi. - Una **relazione tra Treno e Soglia di Ritardo**: ogni tipologia di treno potrebbe avere una o più associazioni a diverse soglie di ritardo, a seconda di come le regole siano definite (per esempio, alcune tipologie di treni potrebbero avere soglie di indennità differenti). - Una **relazione tra Stazione e Soglia di Ritardo**: ogni stazione, attraverso i viaggi di treno, sarebbe in relazione con una soglia di ritardo per determinare se un ritardo che supera una certa soglia si è verificato presso quella stazione. - Una **relazione tra Soglia di Ritardo e Indennità**: questa relazione determina quale indennità è applicabile quando un ritardo rientra in una specifica soglia. - Una **relazione tra Viaggio e Indennità**: traccia quali viaggi hanno portato a quale indennità. In questo modo, il sistema può facilmente associare un ritardo rilevato con la soglia di ritardo corretta e poi assegnare l'indennità appropriata. Questa strutturazione permette anche di generare report e di eseguire analisi sui dati storici delle indennità, per tipo di treno e per fascia oraria, come richiesto dalle specifiche del sistema."},{"instruction":"So what is steady state, and why isn‘t it the same thing as chemical equilibrium? What would happen to life if steady state was the same as a chemical equilibrium? How do various types of life acquire their carbon and energy? Glycolysis is almost identical in all of life; what problems does this chemical process solve? What problems do respiration and fermentation solve? When are they beneficial? How do phototrophs transduce light into chemical energy? What are the main inputs and outputs, and how generally are these processes controlled? Where do heterotrophs get their energy and mass?","output":"Steady State vs. Chemical Equilibrium: - **Steady State**: In the context of biological systems or chemical reactions, a steady state occurs when the concentration of reactants and products remains constant over time because the rate of input or formation equals the rate of output or consumption. In steady state, the system is open, and there is continuous flow and exchange with the surroundings. - **Chemical Equilibrium**: At chemical equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time. However, unlike steady state, there is no net flow in or out of the system, and the system is considered closed. If steady state were the same as chemical equilibrium, life as we know it would not exist because living organisms rely on the constant flow of substances and energy to maintain a state far from equilibrium. This nonequilibrium condition allows for the processes of life to occur, such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. Life's Carbon and Energy Acquisition: - **Autotrophs**: These organisms, which include plants and some bacteria, obtain carbon from inorganic carbon dioxide (CO2) and derive energy from sunlight (photoautotrophs) or from the oxidation of inorganic substances (chemoautotrophs). - **Heterotrophs**: These organisms acquire carbon and energy by consuming organic compounds produced by other organisms. They include animals, fungi, and many bacteria and protists. Glycolysis: Glycolysis is a near-universal metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce ATP (energy), NADH (reducing power), and pyruvate. This process solves several problems: - It provides a way to extract energy from glucose, which is a widespread and readily available energy source. - It generates precursors for the synthesis of other biomolecules. - It does so anaerobically, making it versatile, as it can function with or without oxygen. Respiration and Fermentation: - **Respiration**: In respiration, organisms oxidize substrates (like glucose) completely, usually using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, to produce ATP. This process is beneficial because it yields more energy (more ATP) compared to fermentation. Cellular respiration is favored in aerobic conditions. - **Fermentation**: When oxygen is scarce, fermentation allows cells to regenerate NAD+ from NADH to keep glycolysis running, thereby providing a limited amount of ATP. While less efficient, fermentation is crucial for energy production in anaerobic conditions. Phototrophs Transducing Light Energy: Phototrophs, such as plants and cyanobacteria, convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. The main inputs are light energy, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2), and the main outputs are oxygen (O2) and carbohydrates (like glucose). The primary processes involved are light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes and generate ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle, which uses ATP and NADPH to assimilate CO2 into organic molecules. These processes are regulated by various feedback mechanisms that depend on the internal and external environment, like light intensity, CO2 concentration, and the energy needs of the organism. Heterotrophs' Energy and Mass Sources: Heterotrophs obtain energy and mass by consuming organic material, which can come from plants, animals, fungi, or detritus. The carbon from these organic molecules is used to build their bodies and to fuel metabolic processes, while the energy is extracted mainly through cellular respiration or fermentation."},{"instruction":"What are the types of bonds?

Your questions cover a wide range of topics in molecular and cellular biology. I'll provide concise answers to each question, but each topic is rich enough to warrant detailed exploration. # Types of Bonds: 1. Covalent bonds: Strong bonds where atoms share electron pairs. 2. Ionic bonds: Bonds formed by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. 3. Hydrogen bonds: Weak bonds between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to one electronegative atom (like O or N) and another electronegative atom. 4. Van der Waals interactions: Weak attractions or repulsions between molecules or parts of molecules that arise from transient local partial charges. # Functional Groups and Non-covalent Bonds: Functional groups determine the polarity and charge properties of molecules, which in turn influence the ability to form hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. # Water and Bonds: Water can disrupt non-covalent bonds through hydration, either by forming hydrogen bonds with polar molecules or enveloping nonpolar molecules to minimize their disruptive effect on the highly polar water structure. # Basic Types of Macromolecules: 1. Carbohydrates 2. Proteins 3. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) 4. Lipids # Macromolecular Structure and Function: Shapes and chemical properties affect function—enzymatic activity, structural support, cell signaling, etc. For example, proteins' three-dimensional structure dictates their interactions and function. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions can drive protein folding and influence their locations within cellular membranes. # Carbohydrates and Proteins Solving Similar Problems: Carbohydrates can provide structural support (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls) as can proteins (e.g., collagen in animal tissues). Proteins can also serve as enzymes to catalyze biochemical reactions, a role not filled by carbohydrates. # Main Types of Transport Proteins: 1. Channel proteins: Allow passive movement of substances down their concentration gradient. 2. Carrier proteins: Bind and transport specific molecules across the membrane, either passively or actively. 3. ATP-powered pumps: Use ATP to move substances against their concentration gradient. They function similarly by facilitating the movement of molecules across membranes but differ in energy requirement and substrate specificity. # Multiple Transport Proteins for Cellular Functions: Cells use a combination of transport proteins to manage ionic gradients, nutrient uptake, and waste removal, each specifically tailored to the cell's needs. # Creation and Maintenance of Compartments: Compartments enable specific cellular processes to occur in isolation, provide distinct microenvironments for reactions, and help organize cellular functions for efficiency and regulation. # Protein Synthesis and Targeting: Proteins are made on ribosomes. Signal sequences on proteins direct them to the correct compartments, interacting with receptor molecules that guide the proteins to their destination. # Signal Sequences: Signal sequences are short stretches of amino acids that direct the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to specific locations within the cell. # Internal Material Transport in Cells: Cells use vesicles, molecular motors, and cytoskeletal networks to transport materials. Cytoplasmic streaming and tubular transport networks also play roles. # Spaces that Communicate in Cells: The endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and endosomes can directly exchange material via vesicular transport, while the cytosol is separate from the nucleus and mitochondria, which have their own membranes. # Benefits of Cytoskeletal Filaments: Cytoskeletal filaments provide structural integrity, enable cell motility, facilitate cell division, and assist intracellular transport. # Challenges Solved by Cytoskeleton: The cytoskeleton helps in maintaining cell shape, organizing cellular components, and facilitating cell movement and division. # Prokaryotic Cells and Cytoskeleton: While they lack an extensive cytoskeleton like eukaryotes, prokaryotic cells have simpler cytoskeletal proteins that assist in cell division and maintaining cell shape. # Cytoskeletal Molecules in Tissues: Cytoskeletal molecules contribute to muscle contraction, cell division, and the stabilization of tissue structure. # Cell Assembly into Tissues: Cells assemble into tissues through cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrices, and specialized cell junctions that facilitate communication and adhesion. # Tissue Structure and Function in Organisms: In plants, tissues include dermal, vascular, and ground tissue, each with distinct functions. In fungi, the mycelium provides structure and surface area for absorption. In animals, different tissue types (e.g., epithelial, connective, muscle, nervous) reflect specialized functions. # Cell-level Processes and Homeostasis: Cellular respiration, waste removal, regulatory feedback mechanisms, and intercellular signaling all contribute to homeostasis in multicellular organisms. # Arrangement of Cells and Homeostasis: Cells are arranged in ways that facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste, protect against pathogens, and ensure efficient communication within the body. # Cell Regulation of Metabolism, Membranes, and Compartments: Cells regulate metabolism through enzymes and metabolic pathways, form membranes through lipid bilayers and embedded proteins, and create compartments using membranes and proteins to enclose specific areas. # Structural Modification in Cells and Tissues: Cells and tissues respond to environmental changes through mechanisms such as hypertrophy, atrophy, apoptosis, and changes in gene expression. # Cellular Signaling: Cells communicate using chemical signals (hormones, neurotransmitters), which bind to receptors and initiate a cellular response. Signaling pathways include intracellular signal transduction cascades. # Visible Events and Signaling: Growth, development, tissue repair, immune reactions, and other physiological processes are influenced by cellular signaling. # G-Proteins and Molecular Switches: G-proteins bind GDP/GTP, acting as a molecular switch. When bound to GTP, they are active; hydrolysis to GDP inactivates them. This allows for controlled and transient responses. # Cell Response to Signals: A cell's response to a signal depends on the presence of specific receptors and its internal signaling machinery. Different cell types have tailored responses based on their function. # Specificity in Signaling Pathways: Signal pathways may have universal components (like G-proteins), but responses vary based on receptors, signaling proteins, and transcription factors specific to cell types. # Fungi, Plants, Animals Solving Challenges: Organisms use unique adaptations to their structure and metabolism (like cell walls in plants and fungi, or specialized organs and systems in animals) to meet living challenges. # Multicellular Adaptations: Multicellular organisms adapt structurally and behaviorally to different habitats, developing specialized tissues and organs for acquiring resources, reproduction, and survival. # Need for Bulk Flow Systems: Bulk flow systems (like circulatory and respiratory systems) are needed for efficient transport of nutrients, gases, and waste over large distances within multicellular organisms. # Regulation of Cell Division: Cell division is regulated by cell cycle checkpoints (G1, S, G2, and M phases), growth factors, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases. Checkpoints ensure accuracy and correct timing of division. # Essential Processes Breakdown: Malfunction in essential processes can lead to disease, developmental abnormalities, compromised immune response, or death. # Effect of Over- or Under-active Support Systems: Imbalances in physiological systems can lead to disorders or altered homeostasis, necessitating compensatory mechanisms or medical intervention. Each response here encompasses just the tip of the iceberg of understanding these biological concepts. Each topic can be expanded with detailed pathways, examples, and variations across different organisms."},{"instruction":"What are the types of bonds?

Because non-covalent bonds are often based on the polarity or charge of molecules, the type of functional group (like hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, or phosphate groups) can tell you how the molecule is likely to interact with other molecules. For example, hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, while charged groups can form ionic interactions. # Water and Non-covalent Bonds: Water is a polar solvent that can form hydrogen bonds, which can disrupt other weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds between molecules. For instance, water can compete with other polar molecules for hydrogen bonding, effectively dissolving them. In the case of hydrophobic interactions, water molecules will exclude non-polar substances, which can lead to those substances aggregating to minimize their disruptive effect on the highly ordered structure of water. # Four Basic Types of Macromolecules: 1. **Carbohydrates:** Serve as energy storage and provide structural support (e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose). 2. **Proteins:** Perform a wide range of functions including catalysis, support, transport, and regulation (e.g., enzymes, collagen). 3. **Nucleic Acids:** Store and transmit genetic information (DNA and RNA). 4. **Lipids:** Play roles in energy storage, cellular structure, and signaling (e.g., fats, phospholipids, steroids). # Macromolecular Shapes and Chemical Properties: The shape and chemical properties of macromolecules are crucial for their function. The three-dimensional structure of proteins, for example, dictates their specific interaction with other molecules. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on macromolecules will drive their folding, orientation in membranes, and interactions with other molecules. # Carbohydrates vs. Proteins in Solving Biological Problems: Carbohydrates and proteins can both serve similar structural roles, though through different means due to their distinct chemical properties. Cellulose, a carbohydrate, provides structural support in plant cell walls, while collagen, a protein, provides structural support in animal connective tissues. Both serve to maintain the integrity and shape of cells and tissues. Additionally, both proteins (enzymes) and certain carbohydrates (ribozymes, found in RNA) can act as catalysts. # Main Types of Transport Proteins: 1. **Channel proteins:** Create water-filled pores to enable the passive diffusion of certain ions or molecules across the membrane. 2. **Carrier proteins:** Bind specific molecules and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane, functioning in both passive and active transport. 3. **ATP-powered pumps:** Use energy from ATP hydrolysis to actively transport molecules against their concentration gradient, like the sodium-potassium pump. They function similarly by facilitating the movement of molecules across membranes but differ in their specificity, directionality, and energy usage. Channels provide rapid transport but don't actively pump substrates, while carriers and pumps can be specific for particular molecules and can transport substances against the gradient at the expense of energy. # Multiple Transport Proteins in Cells and Tissues: Cells and tissues may use various transport proteins to maintain homeostasis. For example, in kidney cells, various transport proteins work together to reabsorb necessary molecules and ions from the filtrate and excrete waste. Ion channels maintain membrane potential, carrier proteins might allow facilitated diffusion of glucose, while pumps actively transport ions like Na+ and K+ to regulate osmolarity and volume. This collaborative mechanism ensures precise control of the internal environment. By understanding how these macromolecules function and how their structure dictates their role in cellular biology, researchers and medical professionals can better comprehend disease mechanisms, develop pharmaceuticals, and generally expand our knowledge of molecular and cell biology."},{"instruction":"Creating and maintaining compartments is expensive, so why do cells do this?

It is essential for the organization and specialized functions within the cell. # Protein Targeting to Compartments: Proteins are targeted to specific compartments using signal sequences, which are short stretches of amino acids that act like a postal code for the protein. These sequences are recognized by specific receptor proteins which then direct the ribosome to the correct compartment, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or direct the protein to specific transport machinery after the protein has been synthesized. # Importance of Signal Sequences: Signal sequences are necessary for sorting proteins to the correct cellular compartments. They ensure that enzymes, structural proteins, membrane proteins, and secretory proteins reach their designated locations within the cell or are exported outside of the cell. # Internal Material Transport in Cells: Cells use various mechanisms to transport materials internally: - **Vesicular transport:** Materials are packaged into vesicles, which then bud off from one organelle and fuse with another. - **Molecular motors:** Proteins that \\"walk\\" along cytoskeletal filaments while carrying cargo. - **Cytoplasmic streaming:** The flow of cytoplasm can move materials within the cell. # Spaces That Communicate: Direct communication occurs between: - **Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus:** Via vesicular transport. - **Golgi apparatus and cell membrane:** Vesicles transport proteins and lipids to the membrane. - **Organelles and cytoplasm:** Through channels and transporters. The nucleus is typically separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope and communicates through nuclear pores. # Benefits of Cytoskeletal Filaments: Cytoskeletal filaments provide structural support, enable cell motility, facilitate intracellular transport, assist in cell division (mitosis and meiosis), and help maintain cell shape. # Challenges Solved by Cytoskeleton: The cytoskeleton provides mechanical strength, aids in cellular movement (such as migration during development or wound healing), and supports organelle transport and positioning. It is also crucial for the separation of chromosomes during cell division. # Prokaryotic Cytoskeleton: Prokaryotic cells do have cytoskeletal elements that are structurally similar to actin filaments (MreB) and microtubules (FtsZ) of eukaryotes, though they are generally simpler and not as extensively developed. They help maintain cell shape, protect against osmotic pressure, and are involved in cell division. # Cytoskeletal Molecules at Work in Tissues: In muscle tissue, cytoskeletal actin and myosin filaments interact to produce contraction. In epithelial tissues, keratin filaments provide structural support. Microtubules are critical in cilia and flagella for movement. # Cell Assembly into Tissues: Cells assemble into tissues through intercellular junctions (tight junctions, gap junctions, desmosomes) and extracellular components like the extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides a scaffold for cellular attachment and communication. # Tissue Arrangement and Function: In plants, tissues are organized into systems like the dermal, vascular, and ground tissue, each specialized for protection, transport, or support. In fungi, the mycelium provides an extensive network for nutrient absorption. Animals have various tissues, such as epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous, each designed for specific functions like protection, support, movement, and signal transmission. The structure of these tissues directly reflects their specific functions, with structural components (e.g., collagen in connective tissue or cellulose in plant cell walls) suited to their roles."},{"instruction":"How do cell-level processes contribute to homeostasis of complex multicellular organisms?

Why does that make them a perfect molecular switch?","output":"# Cell-level Processes and Homeostasis: Cell-level processes contribute to homeostasis by regulating internal conditions through feedback mechanisms. This includes maintaining pH, temperature, ion concentrations, and nutrient levels. Cells respond to changes in their environment by altering gene expression, metabolic activities, and signaling pathways to keep physiological parameters stable. # Cell Arrangement and Homeostasis: The way cells are organized into tissues and organs allows for compartmentalization of functions, creating specialized systems for circulation, digestion, excretion, and more. For example, epithelial tissues form barriers to control the exchange of substances, while blood cells operate in the circulatory system to distribute nutrients and remove waste. # Regulation of Metabolism, and Formation of Membranes, Barriers, and Compartments: Cells regulate metabolism through enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions, which are modulated based on cellular needs and extracellular signals. Membranes are formed by lipid bilayers embedded with proteins, creating selective barriers. Compartments, such as organelles within eukaryotic cells, isolate specific reactions, DNA storage, or energy production, allowing for increased efficiency and control. # Structural Modification of Cells and Tissues: Cells and tissues can adapt their structure in response to environmental changes through mechanisms such as hypertrophy, atrophy, cell migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. For example, muscle cells can increase in size (hypertrophy) with exercise due to increased demand for force production. # Cellular Signaling: Cells signal to each other using molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines. These can bind to receptors on target cells, activating intracellular signaling cascades that modify cellular functions. The mechanisms include paracrine, autocrine, endocrine, and direct signaling (via gap junctions or cell-to-cell contact). # Large, Visible Events and Signaling: Large events connected to signaling include growth and development, the immune response, wound healing, reproduction, and coordination of complex behaviors, such as the fight or flight response. These processes are often initiated or regulated by signaling molecules. # Common Features of G-proteins and their Role as a Molecular Switch: All G-proteins can bind guanine nucleotides, either GDP (inactive form) or GTP (active form). They act as molecular switches by responding to signals from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Upon receptor activation, the G-protein exchanges GDP for GTP, activating it. The active G-protein then interacts with other cellular effectors to generate a response. GTPase activity later hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning the G-protein to its inactive state. This cycle makes G-proteins perfect molecular switches because they can quickly oscillate between on and off states, controlling the duration and intensity of signals. The coordination across these cellular activities forms the basis of homeostasis in multicellular organisms, demonstrating the complexity of life from the smallest to the largest scales."},{"instruction":"What determines if a cell will respond to a signal?

Even if the receptor is present, a cell must have the appropriate intracellular signaling pathways and effector mechanisms to respond. The type of response is determined by several factors, including the nature of the signal, the receptor type, and the cell's specific complement of proteins that interpret and propagate the signal. # Specificity in Signaling Pathways: Pathways specific to cell types often involve receptors and proteins that are uniquely expressed or activated in those cells, allowing for tailored responses. Downstream elements such as transcription factors may also be specific, resulting in cell type-specific gene expression in response to the same signal. A cell cannot have a receptor for every signal partly because of the energy and resources required to produce and maintain them, and because having too many active receptors could lead to constant, non-selective signaling, which could be detrimental to the organism’s function and survival. # Different Organisms’ Solutions: Fungi, plants, and animals each have unique solutions to environmental challenges, largely informed by evolution. For example: - **Fungi** absorb nutrients from their surroundings using a network of hyphae that increase surface area. - **Plants** convert light into chemical energy through photosynthesis and have specialized structures like roots, stems, and leaves to gather resources (water, CO2, and nutrients). - **Animals** have developed various organ systems to ingest and digest food, circulate nutrients, and excrete waste. # Adaptation of Multicellular Organisms to Habitats: Multicellular organisms adapt to habitats through structural, physiological, and behavioral modifications. Such adaptations could be changes in body size, development of insulating layers, specialized limbs or roots for particular environments, or social structures that facilitate survival. # Need for Bulk Flow Systems: In multicellular organisms, diffusion alone is too slow to distribute nutrients, gases, and waste products in a timely manner due to their larger size. Bulk flow systems, like circulatory and respiratory systems, provide efficient transport over greater distances within the body. # Regulation of Cell Division: Cell division is regulated through the cell cycle, a tightly controlled series of events that ensure cells only divide when needed and that the process is executed accurately. Regulation occurs at checkpoints: - **G1 checkpoint:** Determines whether the cell has sufficient resources and appropriate signals to proceed to DNA replication. - **G2 checkpoint:** Ensures that DNA replication has been completed correctly before mitosis. - **M checkpoint:** Verifies proper chromosome alignment and attachment to the spindle fibers before allowing chromosome segregation and cell division. These checkpoints prevent errors in cell division that could lead to cell malfunction or diseases such as cancer. # Effects of Breakdown in Essential Processes: If essential processes break down, it can lead to diseases, developmental defects, reduced functionality, and potentially death, depending on which process is impaired and to what extent. # Over- or Under-active Support Systems on the Organism: An overactive system can lead to conditions such as overgrowth, hyperactivity, or hypertension, while an under-active system might lead to atrophy, lethargy, or hypotension. The overall effect on the organism will depend on the role of the system, its integration with other systems, and the organism's ability to compensate for the dysregulation.

These objectives, in turn, form the basis for the selection of marketing strategies and tactics. A company may have several objectives. Although marketing objectives usually tend to support business objectives, business and marketing objectives may also be one and the same. It should be pointed out that there are several types of objectives, such as financial and corporate objectives. Additionally, objectives may be departmental or divisional. However, regardless of the type or format, each objective requires its own strategy. Objectives are needed in a number of areas – production objectives, financial objectives, etc. In a market-driven company, marketing objectives are the most important as they reflect customer needs and how the company can satisfy these. In a market-driven company, marketing plans come first in the overall corporate planning process. The objectives of other areas must then be consistent with marketing objectives. In addition to this element of consistency, objectives should be expressed unambiguously, preferably quantitatively, and with an indication of the time span within which the objectives are planned to be achieved. The acronym SMART describes the requirement for such objectives: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time related. This time span of planned activities often gives rise to some confusion in planning literature. Marketing plans are often categorised as being short range, intermediate range and long range. The confusion arises from the fact that there is no accepted definition of what constitutes the appropriate time horizon for each of these categories. What is felt to comprise long-term planning in one company (say five to ten years) may be considered intermediate in another. It is suggested that the different planning categories are identical in concept, although clearly different in detail. Furthermore, the different planning categories are ultimately related to each other – achieving long-term objectives requires first that intermediate and short-term objectives be met. The following criteria are necessary for setting objectives: Ensure objectives focus on results Because the effects of marketing activity are essentially measurable, sales and marketing strategies should enable the quantification of marketing achievement. Establish measures against objectives • Return on investment. Where possible have a single theme for each objective Imprecise objectives such as ‘reduce customer defections by 20% through best-in-class service’ are not acceptable. There are at least two objectives here and each should be quantified. Ensure resources are realistic Best practice: attempt to answer common marketing problems through the use of test and roll-out plans. Because testing enables roll-out costs to be estimated reasonably accurately, this should ensure that campaign running costs are realistic. (Although overheads or labour cost may not be.) Ensure marketing objectives are integral to corporate objectives This is indisputable, because there will be a serious mismatch if corporate objectives differ from marketing objectives, e.g. general corporate objectives suggest expansion into new member countries of the European Union, and specific marketing objectives only include current member countries.","output":"Following the completion of preliminary steps, the enterprise is positioned to articulate precise objectives and targets that it aspires to fulfill. These objectives serve as the foundation upon which marketing strategies and tactics are predicated. Enterprises may articulate a multitude of objectives. While it is commonplace for marketing objectives to underpin the broader business goals, there are instances in which they are congruent. It is noteworthy to mention that objectives can be categorized into various types such as financial and corporate, and they can be further distinguished as functional within specific departments or divisions. Regardless of their classification or presentation, each objective necessitates a distinct strategy. Objectives are imperative across various facets of business operation, encompassing production, finance, and others. Within the context of a market-oriented enterprise, marketing objectives epitomize the pinnacle of importance as they reflect the needs of the customer base and delineate how the enterprise plans to address these needs. Marketing plans typically occupy a primary position in the hierarchy of corporate planning within such organizations, hence necessitating that objectives in other domains are aligned with marketing imperatives. Moreover, for maximal efficacy, objectives should be articulated with clarity, quantifiable parameters, and a defined timeline for achievement. The SMART acronym demarcates the criteria for well-articulated objectives: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Confusion often ensues in the discourse on planning due to the lack of consensus regarding the designation of timeframes for short-term, intermediate, and long-term planning. Definitions of 'long-term' can vary significantly across different entities, with a time horizon of five to ten years being deemed as 'intermediate' by some organizations. While planning categories share conceptual similarities, their details are distinctively different. Success in long-term goals is predicated upon the attainment of shorter-term milestones. Criteria for establishing objectives include: 1. Centering objectives on tangible outcomes, thereby making it possible to quantify the impact of marketing initiatives. Notably, sales and marketing strategies should facilitate the measurement of marketing performance. 2. Defining clear metrics against objectives, for instance, employing a return on investment (ROI) metric. 3. Encapsulating a singular focus for each objective to maintain clarity and measurability; objectives such as 'reduce customer attrition by 20% through premier service standards' lack precision as they amalgamate multiple aims, which should be quantified separately. 4. Ensuring that resource allocation is aligned with objectives and remains within the realm of feasibility. 5. Embracing best practices through the use of pilot tests and phased implementation plans in order to refine marketing solutions to common challenges. 6. The integration of marketing objectives within the framework of the overall corporate aims is essential to avoid mismatches, as juxtaposing corporate objectives advocating expansion into new European Union member states with marketing objectives confined to current members would lead to strategic dissonance."},{"instruction":"Describe the differences between a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and SPS (Standby Power Supply) make it like a student","output":"Alright, let's break it down like we're studying for an upcoming exam. So, we've got two distinct types of power protection devices: UPS and SPS. Both are designed to help your electronics deal with power issues, but they do it in slightly different ways. **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):** Think of a UPS as your overprotective buddy who's always ready to catch you if you fall - instantly. It's plugged into the wall, and your device is plugged into it. Inside the UPS is a battery, and it's always charging when the power's good. The clever trick here is that the UPS is always running your gear off its battery, not directly from the wall. So, if the power goes out or there's a surge, the UPS switch isn't noticeable - it's seamless. That means zero interruption. And that's vital for sensitive stuff like computers or servers, so they don't shut down unexpectedly. **Standby Power Supply (SPS):** Now, picture an SPS as the friend who's got your back but needs a moment to realize you’re in trouble. The SPS is more of a reactive system. So, normally, your device is getting power straight from the wall, just like plugging it into any outlet. Inside the SPS, there's also a battery, but it's on standby (hence the name). If the power goes out or there's a big spike, the SPS has a little detection system that notices this and goes, \\"Oh no, power problem!\\" It quickly switches over to the battery, but not instantly - there's a short delay. That tiny lag is usually fine for less critical devices like a lamp or a fan, but it might be a problem for your computer; it can cause it to restart. So to summarize: - A UPS is always on active duty, giving you an immediate power backup with no switching time, making it perfect for sensitive and essential electronics. - An SPS chills out in the background and steps in when needed, but it takes a brief moment to kick in, which is fine for less critical devices. That’s the key difference – the UPS doesn’t make you blink, but with an SPS, you might notice the lights flicker."},{"instruction":"Differentiate between the functions of TCP and UDP, making a special emphasis on the overhead in each case.","output":"Alright, let's dive in and compare two key players in the networking game: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Both are used to send bits of data—known as packets—over the internet. But they're quite different in how they handle the job, especially when it comes to overhead. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Think of TCP as the meticulous librarian who's obsessed with order and rules. It’s like sending a valuable package through a courier service that requires a signature upon delivery. High overhead? Yes, but it's all in the name of reliability. Functions of TCP: 1. **Connection-oriented**: TCP is all about establishing a reliable connection. Before any data is sent, a handshake process is done to make sure both ends are ready to communicate. 2. **Order and reliability**: TCP keeps tabs on packets. If some data is sent in order, it makes sure it arrives in that same sequence. Lost a packet along the way? TCP will notice and resend it. 3. **Flow control**: Too much data too fast is a mess. TCP manages the data flow to ensure packets aren't overwhelming the receiver. 4. **Error-checking**: It checks packets for any mistakes and only accepts them if they're error-free. 5. **Congestion control**: TCP senses network congestion and throttles back its data transfer rate to ease the jam. The overhead comes from all the checks and balances TCP does: acknowledgments for received packets, sequence numbers to keep things in order, and all the back-and-forth communication to make sure everything is A-OK. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** On the other hand, UDP is like the chill friend who just tosses you your stuff and hopes you catch it. Imagine sending a bunch of postcards with no return address or confirmation—they just get sent out, and that's that. Light on overhead? You bet! Functions of UDP: 1. **Connectionless**: UDP doesn't waste time shaking hands or setting up a strict connection. It just sends the data to the receiver's address, hoping for the best. 2. **Speed**: It's all go, go, go with UDP—the postal service of the digital world. It sends out the data without waiting to see if it got there: no handshakes, no acknowledgments. 3. **Efficiency**: Since there's no need for order and error-checking, systems that need to be fast and can handle some loss use UDP. Think live broadcasts or online games. 4. **Simplexity**: It's simple, which makes it complex. Without the process of checking and reordering, if anything arrives messed up or doesn't arrive at all, the application on the receiving end has to deal with it. UDP’s overhead is minimal because it skips all the meticulous tracking and confirmation steps that TCP performs. There are no sequence numbers, no acknowledgments, and no flow control. UDP just hands off the packets and moves on. So, in terms of overhead: - **TCP** has a high overhead due to its focus on reliability and ordered data delivery. This ensures a more robust communication, but it comes at the cost of additional processing and data exchange. - **UDP** has low overhead because it cuts out all the reliability features that slow down TCP. It's all about speed and efficiency, even if that means occasionally dropping the ball—or packet, in this case."},{"instruction":"Mention any 4 application layer protocols of your choice by completing the table below.

Port 20 is for data transfer, while port 21 is for control (commands and responses). - **DNS (Domain Name System):** DNS uses both TCP and UDP, but primarily UDP because it's usually a quick, single-request response transaction ideal for UDP. TCP is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as a zone transfers. Port 53 is the designated port for both TCP and UDP. - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** This UDP protocol is used to assign IP addresses and other network configurations to devices on a network so they can communicate on that network and/or the Internet. Port 67 is used for the DHCP server, and port 68 is for the DHCP client. - **RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol):** RTSP, often used in entertainment and communication systems to control streaming media servers, is TCP-based and leverages port 554 for communication. While different protocols can use the same transport layer protocol, whether they use TCP or UDP largely depends on the requirements of the application, such as whether speed or reliability is more critical for the service being provided."},{"instruction":"سلام من دانشجوی مقطع دکتری ، در رشته ی مدیریت رسانه هستم . میخواهم یک تحقیق درسی درمورد یکی از این سه دسته: Video and Audio (رسانه های صوتی و تصویری) یا Cinema and music (سینما و موسیقی) یا social media (رسانه های جمعی) باید راهبردهای استراتژی رسانه هر کدام از سه دسته ای که ذکر شدند را ، در سه حوزه ی تخصصی بررسی کنیم : 1) Technology and platform (فناوری و پلتفورم) و 2) Content and storytelling (محتوا و روایتگری) و 3) Relations and Stakeholders (روابط و ذینفعان) استاد شش تا کتاب معرفی کرده و گفته منبع اصلی تحقیق این شش کتاب هستن (که اطلاعات آنها را در ادامه برایت میفرستم) . تحقیق هرکدام از سه فصل باید باید 15 فصل باشد. هر فصل هم 6 قسمت (شش بخش یا شش تیتر جداگانه) استاد گفته در تحقیقات تون به این موارد هم اشاره بشه تحلیل ماهیت رسانه شناخت چشم انداز سازمان رسانه ای مربوطه پارادایم شیفت و تاریخچه و ... متوجه موضوع شدی کاملا؟؟ میتونی کمکم کنی برای نوشتن ؟؟","output":"سلام! بله، موضوع تحقیق شما برای رسانه‌های صوتی و تصویری، سینما و موسیقی یا رسانه‌های جمعی است که باید با تمرکز بر روی سه حوزه تخصصی فناوری و پلتفورم، محتوا و روایتگری، و روابط و ذینفعان انجام شود. برای نوشتن تحقیق، شما به تجزیه و تحلیل ماهیت رسانه، شناخت چشم‌انداز سازمان رسانه‌ای و پارادایم شیفت ها و تاریخچه رسانه نیاز خواهید داشت. من می‌توانم شما را با این قسمت‌ها راهنمایی کنم و برخی روش‌های نوشتن و پیشنهاداتی برای هر بخش از تحقیق شما ارائه دهم. اما، لطفاً توجه داشته باشید که من به دانش پایه و موارد بسیار جدید دسترسی ندارم. 1. فناوری و پلتفورم: a. نسل‌های مختلف فناوری‌های رسانه‌ای و تأثیر آن‌ها بر توسعه رسانه. b. پلتفورم‌های نوین و چگونگی شکل‌گیری آن‌ها در سال‌های اخیر. c. فناوری‌های بلاکچین و مالکیت دیجیتال از طریق توکن‌های غیرقابل تعویض (NFT). d. اثر استفاده از هوش مصنوعی و داده‌کاوی در ساخت و توصیه‌گری محتوا. e. روند تغییر از پخش خطی به بسترهای VOD (ویدیو درخواستی). f. تأثیر فناوری‌های نوین مانند VR/AR بر تجربه‌ی رسانه‌ای. 2. محتوا و روایتگری: a. نحوه توسعه محتوا برای تلفیق با نسل جدید پلتفورم‌ها. b. استراتژی‌های روایتگری در دیجیتال و محیط‌های چندرسانه‌ای. c. اهمیت سبک و ژانر در جلب مخاطبان هدف. d. نقش روایت‌های تعاملی و بازی‌های ویدئویی در هنر روایتگری. e. تأثیر و چالش‌های محتوای UGC (محتوای تولید شده توسط کاربران). f. استفاده از تحلیل‌های داده‌محور برای شکل‌دهی به استراتژی محتوا. 3. روابط و ذینفعان: a. شناسایی و ایجاد روابط با ذینفعان کلیدی در صنعت رسانه. b. مدیریت تعارض‌های منافع در میان ذینفعان مختلف. c. استراتژی‌های ارتباطی برای تعامل با مخاطبان و پاسخگویی به بازخوردها. d. تأثیر رسانه‌ای شدن روابط اجتماعی و سیاسی. e. نفوذ شبکه‌های اجتماعی در شکل‌دهی روابط عمومی. f. تاثیر افشاگری‌ها و جنبش‌های اجتماعی در بازیابی و حفظ سرمایه اجتماعی. لطفاً اطلاعات دقیق‌تر در مورد کتاب‌های معرفی شده توسط استاد خود را ارائه دهید، زیرا استفاده از مواد آموزشی تخصصی برای تقویت تحقیق شما ضروری است. من می‌توانم کمک کنم تا محتوای تحقیق شما را چگونه می‌توان با مطالعه این کتاب‌ها یکپارچه سازید."},{"instruction":"Steps to cover a 1.7m x 1.7m hole with a 2.44m x 1.2m wooden board with minimal cuts","output":"To cover a 1.7m x 1.7m hole with a 2.44m x 1.2m wooden board with minimal cuts, you have to make sure that the cuts are planned in a way that reduces waste and ensures the entire hole is covered. Here's a step-by-step process: 1. Measure and Mark: - First, take precise measurements of the hole to confirm that it is indeed 1.7m x 1.7m. - Then, measure the wooden board to confirm its dimensions (2.44m x 1.2m). - Lay the board on a flat surface and use a straight edge and a pencil to mark the necessary cuts. 2. Plan the Cut: - With the wooden board being longer (2.44m) than is necessary, you can plan a single cut across the width to create a piece that will cover the 1.7m requirement. - Mark a straight line at 1.7m from one end of the board across the width (1.2m side). - This will leave you with two pieces of wood: one 1.7m x 1.2m and another 0.74m x 1.2m. 3. Cut the Board: - Before cutting, make sure you have the proper safety equipment such as goggles and gloves. - Use a saw appropriate for cutting wood (circular saw, handsaw, table saw, etc.) to make the cut along the line you marked at 1.7m. 4. Position the Main Piece: - Place the larger piece (1.7m x 1.2m) over the hole to ensure it covers the majority of the opening. - Since the 1.2m width is shorter than the 1.7m needed to cover the hole completely, you will have a 0.5m gap (1.7m - 1.2m). 5. Use the Remaining Piece to Fill the Gap: - From the remaining piece (0.74m x 1.2m), you need to cut a strip long enough to cover the 0.5m gap. - Mark and cut a 0.5m wide strip along the 0.74m length of the leftover piece. This strip should be 0.74m x 0.5m. - With this piece, you will now have a piece of wood that measures 1.7m x 0.5m to fill the gap. 6. Secure the Pieces: - Place the 1.7m x 1.2m piece over the hole, aligning it to cover as much as possible. - Then place the 1.7m x 0.5m strip next to the larger piece to complete the cover. - Make sure there are no gaps or overlap between the two pieces. - You can secure these pieces to the surrounding area with screws or nails if the board is meant to be a permanent or semi-permanent fixture. Ensure that the securing hardware penetrates into a firm support structure around the hole for a tight fit. By following these steps, you would have covered the hole with a single cut and minimal waste. Keep in mind that the final coverage will have a seam where the two pieces meet. If the finish needs to be seamless or if the board requires additional treatment (like weatherproofing or painting), those steps should be done as needed."},{"instruction":"لدي لوخ خشبي ابعاده 1.22x2.44 و اريد اقل عدد ممكن من القطع من هذا اللوح لملأ مسلخة ابعادها 1.7x1.7","output":"لتغطية فتحة بأبعاد 1.7 متر x 1.7 متر باستخدام لوح خشبي بأبعاد 1.22 متر x 2.44 متر بأقل عدد من القطع، يمكنك اتباع الخطوات التالية: 1. بما أن عرض اللوح الخشبي (1.22 متر) أقل من البُعد الأصغر للفتحة (1.7 متر)، لن تستطيع تغطية الفتحة من هذا الجانب بقطعة واحدة. لذلك يجب استخدام طول اللوح الخشبي (2.44 متر) لتغطية الفتحة. 2. بما أن طول اللوح الخشبي أطول من الفتحة، يمكن استخدام جزء من الطول لتشكيل أول جزء يغطي جزءًا من الفتحة بحيث: -

Cette fréquence minimale est appelée fréquence de Nyquist. Si la fréquence d'échantillonnage est \`f_e\`, alors la fréquence de Nyquist est \`f_N = f_e / 2\`. Toutes les fréquences dans le signal échantillonné au-dessus de cette valeur ne seront pas représentées correctement à cause du phénomène d'aliasing. Pour votre fonction de transfert, si vous avez une fréquence d'échantillonnage de \`f_e = 1000 Hz\`, alors la fréquence de Nyquist est de \`f_N = 500 Hz\`. Dans le diagramme de Bode, la borne supérieure en abscisse des pulsations (fréquences) sera donc cette fréquence de Nyquist (500 Hz dans votre cas). En ce qui concerne MATLAB, la fonction \`bode\` ajuste le tracé sur une plage de fréquences adaptée, mais si vous utilisez des outils de tracé spécifiques pour les systèmes discrets, comme \`freqz\` mentionné précédemment, vous devriez être conscient de cette limite pour interpréter correctement le tracé.

Электроника управления: - Для управления моторами можно использовать драйверы на основе микросхем H-bridge, как L298N или более мощные варианты, способные выдерживать более высокие токи. 4. Аккумулятор: - Зимнее средство передвижения должно иметь аккумулятор с хорошей работоспособностью в условиях низких температур. Литий-железо-фосфатные (LiFePO4) аккумуляторы обладают лучшей производительностью в холодном климате по сравнению с LiPo или Li-ion. 5. Управление: - Для дистанционного управления можно использовать стандартный RC-комплект. Однако важно, чтобы приемник и передатчик были защищены от влаги, так как снег может вызвать короткие замыкания электроники. 6. Камера: - FPV-камера со встроенным обогревом или защищенная теплоизоляционным корпусом для предотвращения обледенения. Некоторые модели FPV-камер имеют встроенные обогревательные элементы, пригодные для работы в зимних условиях. 7. Материалы и адаптация: - При изготовлении средства передвижения предпочтительны материалы, устойчивые к низким температурам, такие как ABS-пластик или особо прочные полимеры. Важно учесть водонепроницаемость всех соединений и электронных компонентов. 8. Прочие аспекты: - Яркая светодиодная подсветка для улучшения видимости в зимние короткие дни и в условиях плохой погоды.

This makes it the world's largest country, with incredibly diverse geography and abundant natural resources. It shouldn't be surprising that this has attracted a large population estimated at 466 million. 300 million live in the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB), 51 million in the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB), and 108 million in the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB). Others live in overseas territories. The three largest groups are Britannians, Acadians, and Hispanics. (Note: Britannians are a specific ethnic group that is mostly of British and Irish origin. A study found that the average Britannian is of 62% British or Irish ancestry, 29% Germanic, including Germans, Scandinavians, and Dutch, 7% French, and 2% of other European origins.) Blond hair and blue eyes are common among Britannians, present in 52% and 75% respectively. Acadians are well known for their French origins, but in this scenario the typical Acadian is of 63% French DNA, with Italian peoples making up 27%. Other DNA has been traced back to German, Swiss, Iberian, or even British sources, though small in number. Britannians make up around 57% of the total population in New Britannia, and they are not to be confused with \\"New Britannians\\" which refers to people of the entire country. \\"New Britannian has since become synonymous with \\"American.\\" Britannians are prominent just about everywhere. Acadians are prominent in the former Louisiana territory, Acadia (note: Including Northern New England), Louisiana, California, and Florida) (Note: California is part of the province of Serena. Serena would encompass Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada. Montalucio would encompass Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and the Dakotas if these states existed. The state names are still used to specify regions within.). They make up 16% of the population. Hispanics account for 9% of the population. Of the remaining 18%, most of European descent with a smaller native population. 3.0% are of African descent. Slavery was abolished earlier. The capital of New Britannia is Philadelphia, also known as Philly. This is situated in the province of Delmarva. (Note: In real life, Delmarva would be made up of parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, and the Virginias.) Though many of these colonies have since been merged, New Britannia still honors (or honours, as 87% will spell it) its colonial legacy, and it continues to use the Grand Union flag. Some other provinces: Carolina, made from North and South Carolina. Houstonia, made from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Huron is made from Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illlinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Kentucky. Dixie is made from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. In Northern Britannia are the provinces of British Columbia, Victoria (Note:Vancouver Island and its surrounding archipelago), the Northern Territory (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Alaska. By far the largest by land.), Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island. Northern Britannia (Note: known in reality as Canada) is more sparsely populated. Southern Britannia (Mexico) is the newest addition to the country. There were no changes made to the provinces. Sadly, Southern Britannia has also been the target of efforts to suppress the Spanish language, as well as erode any unique identity tied to their unique heritage. New Britannia has utilized replacement migration to weaken their cultural identity. Because New Britannia is prosperous, European groups such as the Irish, Eastern Europeans, as well as Ashkenazi Jews have been used by New Britannia to assert its desired national identity. This makes Southern Britannia (Mexico) the most diverse region, but has shifted the Hispanic share of the population to just 28%. Recently, efforts have made to preserve a Mexican identity, with the establishment of Spanish-speaking schools in Southern Britannia, in which Mexicans can cultivate their identity. Anglicization efforts have waxed and waned with different time periods. There have been numerous benefits as well as drawbacks. For example, The national currency of New Britannia is the Britannian pound (𝕷). While the tide began to turn in the 1940s, the Cold War was another turning point. (Note: New Britannia fought on the side of the allies in World War II. It and the Soviet Union were the real victors, and promptly divided the world into spheres of influence. New Britannia founded NATO in 1949, and the Soviet Union responded with its Warsaw Pact.) The Soviet Union had targeted Mexicans with the aim of spreading communism, and disrupting the unity of New Britannia. This causes Anglicization efforts, which had begun to decline, to ramp back up, lead by figures such as J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy. They would largely come to an end in 1995, after the end of the Cold War. Unsurprisingly, New Britannia is traditionally anti-communist, though this varies among major ethnic groups. According to official surveys, around 67% of Britannians would rather perish than accept a communist takeover of the country, with 91% holding negative views of communist governance. This number dropped to 48% and 72% respectively for Acadians, but the sentiment is clearly there. Among Hispanics, these same numbers are 34% and 51%. New Britannia (Note: In this scenario South Korea and South Vietnam ultimately won with New Britannian help, and annexed their rivals) fought in the Korean and Vietnam Wars to great success. New Britannia has a unique system of governance. Citizens over 21 take the Civic Aptitude and Knowledge Exam (CAKE), which is designed to ensure that voters are knowledgeable enough to participate in politics. Voting points are weighted based on exam performance. It shouldn't surprise anyone that New Britannia's national dish is the cheeseburger, the crown of its rich culinary scene. Should you look hard enough, you'll be able to find a variety of cuisines including the Southern cuisine in Dixie, the Tex-Mex flavors in Houstonia, and the influence of French and Italian gastronomy of the Acadians. Something else worth mentioning about Acadians is that they favor warm areas such as Texas, California, and Florida. The ones that do not already live in these places will frequently journey to warm places in New Britannia during the Winter. But because New England is one of the oldest colonial regions, they are still known as Acadians. They're also known as Cajuns in Louisiana, Dixie. Cajuns have their own unique cuisine, known for hearty dishes which use liberal seasoning. Seafood is prominent here, though obviously it isn't the only food. Po'Boys, gumbo, and jambalaya are popular treats. Acadians have a vibrant, outgoing culture and are known for their love of good food, wine, and art, and they've left their mark on plenty of cities, such as New Orleans, Miami, and San Francisco. Acadians are a smaller population than the Britannians, and yet they are the cause of much fascination. Descended primarily from two cultures almost universally viewed as romantic, sopisticated, and with great taste, it's no surprise they are a major player in the food market. Authentic French food, authentic Italian food, creative fusion food, and even sometimes Alsatian are devoured by millions of New Britannians. In addition to already-established foods, experimental dishes such as the garlic parmesan croissant have also attained popularity. Of course, as pizza and pasta dishes are also present, alongside salads. The quattro formaggi (Italian for four-cheese) variant is the most popular pizza in New Britannia. It's loaded with a crushed tomatoes and topped with fontina, gorgonzola, parmesan, and tiny balls of mozzarella that leave visible spots in the finished product. For salad: Apple and Gorgonzola Salad: Combining Acadian and Britannian influences, a salad made with local apples, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and a cider vinaigrette would marry flavors from both cultures. Panzanella Cascadienne: A twist on the Italian bread salad, incorporating locally-produced vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers, with the addition of smoked salmon, a popular item in the Pacific Northwest. Wild Rice and Cranberry Salad. Lyonnaise Salad: A warm salad featuring frisée lettuce, crispy bacon (lardons), a poached egg, and a Dijon vinaigrette, reflecting the French influence in Acadian culture. Meat is central to most Britannian cuisines. It's not at all uncommon for those living in the Northeast, Delmarva or New England specifically, to eat steak, eggs, and potatoes for a hearty breakfast. Beef, pork, chicken, and turkey are the most popular. Houstonia and Alberta are well-known sources of delicious beef. Barbecuing is very common, and barbecue has even been combined with Afternoon Tea. One popular dinner dish in Britannian cuisine is braised short ribs served with pappardelle and complementary vegetables such as carrots and onions. Pot pies are also a staple. For dessert, pies and pie-like dishes such as bars, for example the Nanaimo bar served in the Pacific region, Serena and British Columbia, beat out pies in popularity. The most popular are apple pies, cheesecakes, cherry pies, and Mississippi mud pies. Cookies, especially chocolate chip cookies, are a popular snack. While the Korean population is low, some victorious GI's brought Korean barbecue to Britannia. The CSB, or Mexico, as mentioned earlier, is a melting pot. It's 32% Britannian, 28% Hispanic, 15% Acadian, and a large 25% are of Eastern European descent. The largest groups of Eastern European are Slavs, Hungarians, Romanians, and Jews. It's the place to go for authentic Slavic as well as Mexican food, if one seeks a different dining experience. Spanish became an official language in 1975. Northern Mexico, above the 25th parallel north, had been part of Britannia for 148 years prior, while its entirety would be conquered by 1860. English and French have always been official languages. The capital of the CSB is Victoria City, which was known as Mexico City from 1585-1870. Sports are enjoyed by hundreds of millions, with the most popular being Rugby Union (also called rugger colloquially), Baseball, and American Football. These are known as the Big Three, but hockey, basketball, and football (soccer) also have followings. Hockey is especially popular in the CNB. While American football evolved out of the collegiate scene, professional rugby players are drafted at age 17-20 out of the ARU (American Rugby Union), an umbrella organization governing such minor leagues as the Western Rugby League (WRL) with jurisdiction over the west coast and Rockies, or the Southern Rugby League. The largest professional rugby league is the Grand Rugby League (GRL). Nearly every male in New Britannia grows up playing a sport, whether recreational or in pursuit of a career. This contributes to the overall fitness and athletic culture of the country. 25% of New Britannians, or Americans, are overweight, and included in this figure are the 15% who are obese. In total, 25% are overweight or obese. This is not as high as other developed countries but it still accounts for 1 in 4. The most common religion is Christianity; 75% of Britannians are of protestant denominations, and 22% Catholic. Acadians and Mexicans are predominantly Catholic, at 82 and 97%, respectively. Also part of New Britannia are the territories of Hawaii, Cuba, Panama, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, although the Philippines is much larger, its population isn't considered among the 466 million, and it has much more autonomy. Territories have limited rights but receive significant aid and investment. They do not pay income tax to the Britannian government. High-speed public transportation is readily available in most cities and towns. This is optional, and many choose to own and operate their own vehicles. The older provinces tend to be more dense and developed in their entirety, although Western, Dixie, and Mexican provinces have come to be seen as places in which people live and form communities in as opposed to areas with resources to exploit.","output":"It appears you've created an extensive and detailed alternate history scenario for a country called New Britannia, which diverged significantly from our own world's history. In your scenario, the British maintained control over the Thirteen Colonies and expanded their territory to include what we know as the United States, Canada, and Mexico, creating a vast and culturally diverse empire with strong economic and military influence. You've described the demographic composition, cultural influences, governance structures, historical events, culinary scene, sports culture, and religious affiliations within New Britannia with a high degree of specificity. This includes the breakdown of ethnic groups such as Britannians, Acadians, and Hispanics; unique provincial identities and their historical development; and the political landscape marked by anti-communist sentiments and the Cold War. The socioeconomic fabric of New Britannia is influenced by a blend of cultural traditions, with each group contributing to the country's overall character, from cuisine to sports. The country's strong military history and successful interventions in global conflicts such as the Korean and Vietnam Wars indicate a significant place on the world stage, possibly as a superpower rivaling the Soviet Union. The governance system you've proposed, which involves a Civic Aptitude and Knowledge Exam (CAKE) for voters, suggests a society that values informed political participation, with an emphasis on ensuring that the electorate is well-educated about the issues they vote on. The culinary scene of New Britannia is rich and diverse, reflecting the varied origins of its populace. It includes an integration of traditional foods with novel creations that have emerged from the cultural melting pot. This diversity extends into sports as well, with widespread participation and viewership among the populous. Overall, you've painted a fascinating and intricate picture of what life in New Britannia might look like, interweaving historical divergence with social, cultural, and political elements to create a plausible though fictional universe. It would be interesting to explore how New Britannia interacts with other global powers, manages internal divisions and cultural integration, and positions itself in an alternate version of today's interconnected world."},{"instruction":"Write a story that takes place in 1995. It's set in Yorkshire (formerly known as Monterrey, in the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia. It's known for its Spanish colonial architecture, though 82% of the city is now English-speaking.) The son of real estate agents Jacob and Eleanor Bainbridge, Christian is a middle-class policeman, working for the New Leon (Nuevo León) Police Department (NLPD). But today he's a spectator at a rugby match with his friends Eddie Stark and Amy Nolan. Yorkshire Rugby Football Club, (or just Yorkshire, or the Yorkies), is struggling, and they are playing against Dallas to avoid a rare relegation. (Note: relegation can only happen every three or four years in the GRL, and only when a team is so bad they are deemed \\"non-competitive.\\") Yorkshire has not only lost 20 of its first 24 matches of 34, but they are also playing a formidable, 21-3 opponent. Eddie and Amy are in the mood for succulent burritos filled with bbq beef, rice, herbs, and yum yum sauce. Christian opts for pizza puffs - some quattro formaggi and some sausage and peppers. By halftime they're down 16-0. Enter a young server named Karina Goch. A Polish immigrant. Though Britannia had been moving Poles into Mexico since the 19th century, there's just something different about her. She's of the post-1991 immigrant wave, the one after the collapse of communism in Europe. Now, Karina is very nice, sociable, and above all competent. She does her job very well, but the sociable part is something Christian dislikes. He sees outwardly friendly people as \\"fake\\". He does like his pizza puffs, however. The the match ends, 18-16 in favor of Yorkshire, and an argument against relegation. The 21-year-old number eight Frank Hartman, drafted 5th overall in '91, but seen as a bust, stars. After the match, Christian spots Karina abusing drugs. As an officer the law, he feels he's got to step in. She may have to go to rehab, but her parents would likely disown her for using drugs. He ends up inviting her to his place to discuss the entire situation. Scene and dialogue.","output":"Christian Bainbridge stood on the terrace of the packed stadium, beer in hand, as his home team, the Yorkshire Rugby Football Club, were scrumming fiercely against the Dallas team. The score was not in their favor, but the atmosphere was electric with hope and anxiety, shared by his friends Eddie and Amy, who were busy wolfing down their burritos. \\"Eddie, you're spilling sauce on your shirt,\\" Amy chided, her eyes never leaving the field. \\"Who cares? This is awful—if Yorkshire gets relegated, I'll never hear the end of it from my Dallas cousins,\\" Eddie replied, his voice tinged with frustration. Christian chuckled, \\"We’re Yorkshire. We’re tough. We don't go down without a fight.\\" But his words lacked conviction as he glanced at the scoreboard—16-0 at halftime was not promising. That's when Karina Goch approached with the fresh round of food. \\"Pizza puffs and extra napkins for you,\\" she said with a smile that seemed to cut through the tension around them. Even Christian, with his skepticism of overly friendly people, could not deny her charm and efficiency. \\"Thanks,\\" Christian replied curtly, taking the tray from her hands and passing the food to Eddie and Amy. As the second half kicked off and the crowd roared back to life, the points started ticking in favor of Yorkshire, driven by an unexpected heroism from the young Frank Hartman. With each powerful play and strategic maneuver, hope resurged through the stands and by the whistle for the full time, Yorkshire had triumphed with a thrilling 18-16 score. \\"Unbelievable!\\" Eddie shouted, leaping to his feet. \\"Frank's saved us!\\" Amy laughed, wiping tears of joy, \\"I never doubted him for a second!\\" Christian's grin mirrored his friends', but it fell as he saw Karina slink away from the concession stand to a shadowed part of the terrace. Her usual bright demeanor was gone, replaced by quick, furtive glances as she reached into her bag and pulled out a small, suspicious packet. Christian's policeman instincts kicked in. He excused himself from his friends and followed her. \\"Karina!\\" he called out, his voice firm, causing her to jump and shakily hide the packet behind her back. Karina turned, her face pale, \\"Officer Bainbridge, I... It's not what it looks like.\\" \\"Let's not do this here,\\" Christian said, a stern edge to his voice. \\"Why don't we talk somewhere more private?\\" Reluctantly, she nodded, and he led her to his apartment nearby. Once inside, the magnitude of the situation seemed to crush her, and she confessed everything while Christian listened, his face unreadable. \\"I just wanted to fit in, it's not easy being an immigrant here. I've made some bad choices,\\" she whispered, her eyes glistening with the threat of tears. Christian sighed, the burden of upholding the law heavy on his shoulders. \\"Karina, drugs aren't the answer, and you know the consequences. I don't want to take you in,\\" he stated, \\"but I can't just ignore this.\\" \\"I don't want to go to rehab... my parents—they wouldn't understand. They're all I have here,\\" she pleaded, her voice breaking. He watched her, torn between his duty and the empathy he felt for the young woman in front of him, who was so clearly lost. He made a decision. \\"Look, there are community support programs; they offer counseling and help without the stigma of rehab. I can help you get in touch with them,\\" he offered, extending a business card. \\"You'd do that? Why?\\" she asked, a note of disbelief in her tone. \\"Because I believe everyone deserves a second chance,\\" Christian said, a rare smile breaking through his usually stoic demeanor. Karina reached out, taking the card with trembling hands. \\"Thank you,\\" she murmured. \\"I won't forget this.\\" As she left his apartment, Christian felt a weight lift from his shoulders. Hearing the distant cheers still echoing from the stadium, he realized that sometimes the toughest battles weren't fought on rugby fields, but within the soul's quiet confines."},{"instruction":"And so Christian takes Karina home to her parents, Dawid (Note: pronounced David) and Maja. They’re not at all surprised. They’ve asked her to quit repeatedly, enrolled her in rehab. She simply doesn’t listen, and they’ve come to terms with not getting the child they wanted. They take ownership of it. Though for them, at least Anton (Note: Karina’s younger brother) seems to be a bright boy. Karina is more hurt by their indifference than she would be if they outright insulted her. Maja even argues that Karina still has value because she is pretty, and therefore can find a man with a \\"real job\\" to settle down with. Christian stands up for her, and they mockingly tell him that he has no idea who she is or how difficult it is to get her to listen. They tell him he can try his hand at “parenting” her if he wants, but they make it known that Karina can come home at any time. Scene and dialogue.","output":"Christian pulled up in front of a modest two-story house on the outskirts of Yorkshire, where the shades of Spanish colonial architecture still lingered in the ironwork and stucco façades. The lights inside burned brightly, and Karina's fidgeting grew more pronounced as they approached the front door. \\"You don't have to do this, you know,\\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the suburban night. \\"It's alright,\\" Christian replied, \\"I'm not leaving you to face this alone.\\" The door swung open before they could knock, revealing a middle-aged couple with weary eyes that held a mixture of concern and resignation. Dawid crossed his arms, a defensive barrier that was mirrored in his tone. \\"Karina,\\" he began, his Polish accent thick. \\"You missed dinner, again.\\" Maja looked between her daughter and Christian, recognition flashing for a moment, \\"You brought a policeman home? What, did she steal something?\\" \\"No, Mrs. Goch,\\" Christian interjected. \\"I'm here because Karina was in trouble, and I thought it best if I brought her home personally.\\" Dawid scoffed, \\"Trouble, she's always in trouble. We tried everything, Officer...?\\" \\"Bainbridge. But maybe she just needs—\\" \\"Parenting advice from a man who's known her all of two hours?\\" Maja's tone was sharp, bitter even. Karina's face flushed with shame and hurt, \\"Mama, please...\\" \\"I'm not here to judge,\\" Christian continued calmly, keeping his voice steady despite the rising tension. \\"I just think Karina deserves a chance to explain, and maybe together, we can find a way to help her.\\" Maja laughed, a harsh, humorless sound, \\"Help her? We put her in rehab, talked to priests, doctors... Nothing changes.\\" Dawid interjected, \\"And little Anton, he sees all this. He doesn't need the bad influence.\\" \\"You act as though I'm a lost cause. That I'm worth less than Anton!\\" Karina's voice quivered with emotion. \\"No, dziecko, you're not less,\\" Maja said with a sigh, the harshness waning. \\"You're just... different. You're beautiful; you'll find a nice man with a real job, and you won't have to worry.\\" Christian was taken aback; the cold pragmatism was jarring. \\"Mrs. Goch, with all due respect, your daughter's worth is not measured by her ability to marry well.\\" Dawid eyed Christian, a mix of challenge and curiosity in his gaze, \\"And what would Officer Bainbridge suggest then, hm? You want to save Karina, do you?\\" \\"I want to support her making better choices, yes.\\" Christian stood his ground. \\"Karina is capable, and she has potential. I've seen people turn their lives around with less kindness and help.\\" Maja and Dawid exchanged a glance, an entire conversation passing silently between them before Dawid turned back to Christian, \\"Fine. You say you can help? Then help. But remember, she's always welcome back here. She's our daughter, after all.\\" Christian nodded, accepting the tacit challenge, \\"I'll do what I can.\\" Karina, tears brimming in the corners of her eyes, whispered her thanks; a fragile seed of hope finally planted, while her parents watched, their skepticism as much a defense against disappointment as it was an indictment of their own resignation to the situation."},{"instruction":"In the car, Karina admits that in some ways her parents are right about her, but that this will drive her desire to change. Christian doesn’t say anything. He notices she seems absorbed in the scenery, as if she’s never seen it before. He wonders just what brought her and her family to Yorkshire. It wasn't just the allure of a new beginning, but also the draw of year-round warmth. Her father, a former diplomat of the Polish People's Republic, had always been eying an espionage job simply to bring his family to New Britannia, but he didn't want to run the risks of being executed. He was in love with Southern Serena (California), Texas, Cuba, and Mexico. He originally wanted to live on the coast but the mountains sang to him. Additionally, he sought to settle around two similar groups to his own family: Slavs and Catholics. With Yorkshire's high population of both, he was taken with it. Last, he was served a burrito he never forgot on the street. Scene and dialogue.","output":"The hum of the car engine was a soft backdrop to the thoughts swirling in the dimly lit interior. Christian kept his eyes on the road, stealing glances at Karina as she seemed to rediscover the city through the passenger window, her eyes tracing the contours of the Yorkshire landscape like she was seeing it for the first time. \\"You're quiet,\\" he finally said, breaking the silence. Karina's eyes didn't leave the window as she responded, \\"Sometimes I think my parents are right. Maybe I am just a series of mistakes. But I don't want to be. That's what they don't understand.\\" Christian chose his words carefully, \\"Everyone has the power to change, Karina. You just need to decide to use it.\\" She sighed, turning to face him at last, \\"You know, we didn't just come here for a fresh start. My dad, he has always been fascinated by New Britannia. As a diplomat, he'd heard about the warmth of the South, the beaches of Southern Serena, the vibrance of Cuba, and the culture of Mexico. He dreamed of being a spy just to get us here.\\" Christian's brow furrowed, \\"He wanted to be a spy?\\" She chuckled dryly, \\"Yeah, imagine that. A spy in his fantasy, just to avoid the realities of the old regime. But he couldn't stomach the thought of the dangers, the possibility of, you know, execution.\\" \\"The mountains caught his heart in the end, huh?\\" Christian murmured. \\"Mhm, he fell in love with the peaks as we drove through Southern Britannia. Said they sang to him,\\" Karina replied, her voice carrying a fondness she hadn't expected to feel. \\"And he was looking for a community,\\" Christian ventured, his curiosity piqued. \\"Yes. Slavs, Catholics... He wanted to feel at home. In Yorkshire, there's a big community of both. It put him at ease, I guess,\\" Karina's gaze returned to the window but there was warmth now in her reflection. \\"And the food,\\" Christian said with a small smile. \\"Oh, the food!\\" Karina laughed, the sound more genuine than any he had heard from her before. \\"He'll never forget this burrito he had from a street vendor. I swear, it's half the reason we stayed. He talks about it like it was his personal culinary epiphany.\\" Christian shook his head in amusement, \\"Must have been one hell of a burrito.\\" \\"It was,\\" she confirmed. \\"I think deep down, we're still that family looking for that perfect burrito, that perfect street, that perfect community.\\" \\"You've found the street and the community,\\" Christian said gently, glancing her way again. \\"The perfect burrito is up to you, Karina. You make it what you want it to be.\\" Her lips quirked up in a smile as she faced forward, a new resolve settling into her features, \\"Then let's hope I've learned a thing or two from my dad about chasing dreams—minus the espionage, of course.\\" Christian smiled too, focusing on the road ahead, the weight of responsibility mingling with an unexpected sense of companionship. The night was quiet, save for the sound of their mutual understanding weaving through the air, forging a path forward from the crossroads of past and future."},{"instruction":"That night, Christian and Karina go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner and dessert. But first, they are told that Casa de Sabor is not much of a vegan establishment; they have vegetarian dishes but they cook using butter and lard. They are then asked if they would like to continue. Yes. It's quite late, and a waiter named Xavier overhears a conversation between Christian and Karina about how New Britannia became the country it is. Christian speaks of the accomplishments with such pride, a might-makes-right attitude. The waiter on the other hand sees it very differently. Christian doesn't back down. Eventually the heated argument ends when they just start laughing, and they compare how different they are to one another. Scene and dialogue.","output":"The bell above the door of Casa de Sabor tinkled as Christian and Karina walked in. The scent of spices and grilled meats filled the air of the cozy restaurant, which was dimly lit by hanging wrought iron lanterns. They were greeted by a waiter with a warm, albeit tired, smile. \\"Welcome to Casa de Sabor,\\" said the waiter cheerfully. \\"I should let you know, we're not big on vegan options. We've got some vegetarian dishes, but we cook with butter and lard. Is that alright?\\" Christian and Karina exchanged a quick glance and nodded in unison. \\"Yes, that's fine,\\" Christian replied. \\"Great,\\" the waiter, whose nametag read Xavier, said as he led them to a small table by the window. \\"I'll be right back to take your order.\\" Once settled, Christian unfolded his napkin onto his lap, and conversation flowed. Karina, intrigued by the rich history of New Britannia as told by local residents, posed questions that spurred Christian to share his view of their nation’s story. \\"You’ve got to understand, Karina, New Britannia was built on the foundation of strength and resolve. Our ability to maintain control and expand is a testament to our national character,\\" Christian said with a gleam of pride in his eye. Karina listened, noting his conviction, but before she could respond, Xavier, who had returned to take their order, couldn’t help but interject, \\"That perspective is a bit one-sided, don’t you think? Might doesn't make right, and strength comes in many forms—including the resilience to hold onto one's culture and traditions in the face of assimilation.\\" Christian bristled slightly, unused to having his narrative challenged. \\"Our country is strong because it brings together the best from all its parts. It's not about assimilation; it's about forming a stronger, unified identity.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" Xavier countered, a hint of frustration creeping into his voice, \\"but whose identity? The dominant culture's? I mean, look around—Casa de Sabor is thriving because people love what's unique about our heritage. That speaks volumes.\\" A tense air settled between the two men, their ideological divide laid bare amidst the clatter of plates and the murmur of other diners. Karina watched cautiously, her spoon poised above her soup. After a short, yet charged pause, Christian let out a chuckle, shaking his head in disbelief. \\"I never thought I’d be having a political debate with our waiter in a Mexican restaurant at this hour.\\" Xavier, taken aback by the sudden shift in the atmosphere, smiled despite himself, and the laughter proved contagious. Karina joined in, her earlier apprehension melting away. \\"You know, Christian, you're a hard-headed patriot and I'm... well, I'm not sure what I am yet. But I like that we can have these conversations,\\" she said, looking at him with newfound respect. \\"And Xavier,\\" Christian added, still smiling, \\"I appreciate the passion. Even if we don't see eye to eye, it's good to be reminded that not everyone shares my view. We're all New Britannians, after all—different and yet somehow the same.\\" Xavier, now grinning, nodded. \\"It's all about balance, right? Enjoy your meal, folks.\\" With that, Xavier retreated to the kitchen, leaving Christian and Karina to their dinner, their debate turning into a shared jest that further revealed the depth of their differences, yet also, the unexpected bridges between them."},{"instruction":"In the face of the meal, Karina wonders if she should start learning to cook as well. \\"No need,\\" Christian responds. An innocuous response, but to Karina, he sounds just like her mother. Karina may not have turned out the way she wanted, but she isn't the type of person to be satisfied doing nothing. She feels she has to pay back Christian's kindness. Eventually he agrees to get her a cooking book from a Polish specialty shop. The last stop on the night.","output":"As they settled into their meal, the savory aromas enveloping them, Karina watched as a family at a nearby table shared a steaming skillet of fajitas, the parents expertly doling out portions to eager children. She felt a foreign stirring within her—a desire to create, to nurture. \\"You know, maybe I should learn to cook,\\" Karina mused aloud, picking at her enchiladas with a newfound curiosity for the culinary arts. Christian, absorbed in the flavors of his own dish, barely looked up as he responded casually, \\"No need. Plenty of good places like this around. You're fine.\\" Karina felt a twinge in her chest, the words echoing a sentiment she’d hoped to outgrow. \\"I may not have turned out as she wanted, Christian, but I'm not someone who's okay with just... being. I want to do something, to give back for your help.\\" Christian, noting the earnestness in her voice, caught himself, realizing his faux pas. \\"I'm sorry, that came out wrong. I didn't mean to discourage you. If you want to learn to cook, I think that's a fantastic idea.\\" Her eyes lit up with a mixture of relief and newfound determination. \\"Really? Because I want to... maybe not just to cook, but to start shaping who I am going to be. I need this.\\" He smiled at her resolve, feeling a swell of admiration, \\"Then you shall cook. First thing tomorrow, we’ll find you a book. The best one to start with.\\" They finished their meal with light conversation and laughter, the earlier tension forgotten in the shared enjoyment of Casa de Sabor’s offerings. As they stepped out into the cool night air, Christian glanced at his watch. \\"It's not too late. There's a Polish specialty shop a few blocks from here. They might have cookbooks.\\" \\"Tonight? Would you mind?\\" Karina asked, hesitance and hope entangled in her request. \\"Not at all,\\" he assured her with a soft smile. \\"It's the last stop of the night.\\" They walked side by side through the dimly lit streets of Yorkshire, the city more quiet now, the clamor of the dinner crowd replaced with the hushed whispers of the night. When they reached the specialty shop, the warm glow of the interior beckoned them in. Shelves of imported goods, the scent of spices and dried meats, colorful labels in a foreign tongue—it was like stepping into another world. Christian watched as Karina's eyes danced over the contents of the shop, her excitement palpable. She ran her fingers over the spines of cookbooks, each a promise of a journey yet to be embarked upon. When she finally selected one, a hardcover tome titled \\"The Heart of Polish Cooking,\\" her choice was made with a careful kind of reverence. \\"This one,\\" she said, holding it close, as if it weren't just a collection of recipes, but a lifeline to the future she longed to build. Christian paid for the book, insisting it was a parting gift for the night—a symbol of new beginnings. As they left the shop, cookbook in hand, Karina's steps seemed lighter, her path ahead suddenly illuminated with the prospect of change."},{"instruction":"اهلا ماهي نسختك واخر تحديث لك وهل انت GPT-4 Turbo","output":"مرحبًا! أنا موديل من OpenAI، وواجهة البرمجة التي تتفاعل معك الآن تعتمد على GPT-3. قد لا أكون GPT-4 Turbo لأن هذا لا يمكن التحقق منه في الوقت الحالي وليست لديّ القدرة على معرفة ما إذا كنت قد تم تحديثه. إذا كنت تتوقع أحدث المعلومات حول النماذج أو التحديثات التي تقوم بها OpenAI، يُفضل الرجوع إلى الموقع الرسمي للشركة أو إعلاناتها الحديثة للحصول على أدق التفاصيل."},{"instruction":"اهلا ماهي نسختك واخر تحديث لك وهل انت GPT-4 Turbo","output":"أهلاً بك! أنا OpenAI Assistant، وأعتمد على نموذج GPT-4 الذي تم تطويره بواسطة OpenAI. لا تتوفر لدي معلومات مباشرة عن النسخة التي تم استخدامها لتدريبي أو تحديثي الأخير، لأنني ضمن نسخة ثابتة من النموذج التي تم نشرها لاستخدام العام. ومع ذلك، يستمر فريق OpenAI في العمل على تحسين النماذج وإصدار تحديثات. لست متأكدًا من مصطلح \\"GPT-4 Turbo\\" حيث لم يتم الإعلان عن نسخة رسمية بهذا الاسم من قبل OpenAI حتى تاريخ قطع المعرفة؛ قد يكون المصطلح الذي ذكرته جزءًا من تصور أو خطأ شائع. إذا كان لديك المزيد من الاستفسارات أو الأسئلة حول النموذج أو قدراته، يسعدني الإجابة عليها."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"Certainly!

Mark is holding a flyer about hypnosis that brought him here. JESSICA (smiling confidently) What brings you to the world of hypnosis, Mark? MARK (rubbing his neck nervously) Well, it's just... sometimes I feel like my own mind is against me. Jessica leans back, her gaze intense but caring. JESSICA Our minds are like icebergs, Mark. Most of it's beneath the surface. What if you could communicate with that hidden part? Give it a nudge in the right direction? Mark nods, intrigued. MARK Yeah, that would be amazing. But hypnosis, isn’t it just swinging watches and \\"you're getting very sleepy\\"? Jessica laughs lightly, shaking her head. JESSICA That’s stage hypnosis - entertainment. Think of the hypnosis I practice like... unlocking a conversation with your subconscious. It's more natural than you think. MARK How does it work, though? Jessica leans forward, her voice takes on a rhythmic quality. JESSICA Imagine your mind is a bustling street. Thoughts are the people crowding it. What I do is like setting up detours, easing that traffic. Now, confusion inductions, for instance, they momentarily overload that street. Your conscious mind gets distracted, and that's when we can reroute the patterns, create new pathways... Mark listens, visibly fascinated. MARK Create new pathways? You make it sound like city planning. JESSICA (laughing) In a way, it is. It’s about understanding the grid—your personal makeup—and knowing just where to place the signs. MARK (pensively) So what’s a mantra, then, in this city of the mind? Jessica picks up her coffee, gives a thoughtful sip. JESSICA A mantra works like a looped announcement over the city’s PA system - repetition that gently embeds a helpful message into the subconscious until it becomes as familiar as a favorite song. Mark smiles at the comparison. MARK And fractionation? That sounds more... intense. Jessica places her cup down, her expression serious. JESSICA Fractionation is like the rush hour. Bringing you in and out of hypnosis, each time deeper than the last. Just like people adapt to the rhythms of a city, your mind learns to transition smoothly between states of awareness. The anxiety in Mark's eyes begins to dissipate, replaced by a bright curiosity. MARK Okay. This all sounds... surprisingly appealing. Jessica nods, recognizing the shift in him. JESSICA Would you like to take a quick trip through this city of yours? Trust me, there's no place like it. Mark sits up straighter, nodding. MARK Yes. Let's do it.

J'avais une photo prise lors de la rentrée scolaire : nom, prénom, âge et classe des enfants. Je m'en servais pour rappeler à mon enfant de souhaiter un bon anniversaire à ses amis ! Puis, j'ai extrait le texte de cette photo identifié avec des box grâce à l'algorithme avec pytesseract. Le texte est nettoyé, mis en page pour obtenir une table avec les noms des élèves, âge, classe. J'extraie ensuite les informations d'un mail pour récupérer les adresses mails des parents des enfants et compléter ma table.

L'accent est mis sur la mise en place de l'apprentissage automatique profond et l'optimisation de la performance de ces algorithmes pour une application effective et responsable. **Introduction** L'analyse de données non-structurées représente un défi de taille pour les applications d'intelligence artificielle modernes. Le projet décrit dans ce rapport porte sur le développement d'un OCR pour extraire des données à partir d'images de listes de noms et de pages de journaux collectées par web scraping et d'une base de données d'images étiquetées. L'outil final est utilisé pour automatiser la création de rappels d'anniversaire pour les camarades de classe d'un enfant. **D 1 Mise en place d'un apprentissage automatique profond** **D 1.1 Traitement des données non-structurées** L'extraction de données à partir d'images nécessite leur conversion en un format analysable par un algorithme d'apprentissage profond. Le processus commence par la récupération d'images via web scraping et des bases de données en ligne, suivie de leur transformation en matrices numériques grâce à des librairies de programmation telles que TensorFlow et Numpy. **D 1.2 Élaboration de réseaux de neurones adaptés** Pour l'interprétation des données non-structurées, des réseaux de neurones convolutifs (CNN) se sont montrés particulièrement efficaces. Le choix d'utiliser YOLO (You Only Look Once) pour la détection d'objets dans les images tient compte de sa rapidité et de sa précision. TensorFlow a facilité la superposition de couches neuronales pour configurer l'architecture requise. **D 1.3 Création d'un algorithme robuste et précis** En se basant sur un réseau pré-entraîné, nous avons pu affiner le modèle pour répondre spécifiquement à la détection de texte dans les images de listes de noms et pages de journaux. Une attention particulière a été accordée à la minimisation des erreurs et à l'optimisation des performances sur les volumes de données traités. **D 1.4 Génération de données non-structurées** Pour améliorer la fiabilité de notre modèle OCR, des données supplémentaires ont été générées en utilisant des réseaux de neurones adverses génératifs (GAN). Ces données synthétiques ont contribué à enrichir la base d'entrainement et à diversifier les échantillons visuels pour l'entraînement de notre IA. **D 2 Optimisation des performances pour industrialisation** **D 2.1 Évaluation de la performance de l'algorithme** L'évaluation de la performance de l'OCR a été effectuée en utilisant des données d'entraînement et de validation. Des indicateurs comme la précision, le rappel et la mesure F1 ont servi à mesurer l'efficacité du modèle et à déterminer sa viabilité pour un usage plus large. **Conclusion et implications éthiques** Le projet a abouti à la création d'un OCR capable d'automatiser la récupération des dates d'anniversaire à partir de photos de listes de classe. Cependant, cette étude met également en lumière les risques potentiels liés à la confidentialité et à la sécurité des données personnelles. Il est essentiel de sensibiliser et de mettre en place des mécanismes de protection adéquats pour éviter que ces technologies ne soient utilisées à des fins malveillantes. **Annexes** 1.
