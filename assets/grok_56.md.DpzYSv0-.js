She had heard of mages and Crusaders in the stories her father used to tell her, but she never thought she would encounter them in real life.) Natsuki: (whispering to herself) “What do I do? Do I approach them or try to find a way out of here?” (She weighed her options, trying to decide the best course of action. Before she could make a decision, a rustling in the bushes caught her attention. Out stepped a figure she recognized all too well - it was Sayori.) Sayori: “Natsuki! Thank goodness I found you. We have to go, now!” Natsuki: “Sayori, what’s going on? Where are we?” Sayori: “I’ll explain later, but for now, we need to get out of here before they spot us.” (Natsuki hesitated for a moment, but trusted Sayori’s urgency. She followed her friend deeper into the forest, hoping to find some answers to the mysterious situation they found themselves in.)"},{"instruction":"int pthread_create( pthread_t * thread, const pthread_attr_t * attr, void * (*start_routine)(void *), void * arg) why the paramaeters are void and why it return void","output":"The \`pthread_create\` function is used to create a new thread in a POSIX-compliant operating system. The parameters and return types are designed with versatility and generality in mind. Let's break down each part of the declaration to understand the use of \`void\` types and its return type: 1. **\`pthread_t *thread\`**: This is a pointer to a \`pthread_t\` structure that will contain the thread ID of the newly created thread. It's not a \`void\` type; it's a pointer type specific for thread identification purposes. 2. **\`const pthread_attr_t *attr\`**: This pointer to a \`pthread_attr_t\` structure allows you to specify thread attributes (like stack size, scheduling policy, etc.) for the new thread. If you don't need to specify attributes and wish to use the default values, you can pass \`NULL\`. This parameter is also not a \`void\` type but a pointer to a thread attribute object. 3. **\`void *(*start_routine)(void *)\`**: Here, we see \`void\` being used. This parameter is a pointer to the function that the thread will execute once it starts. The \`void *\` return type of the function pointer means it can return a pointer to any type (or \`NULL\`). The \`void *\` argument type allows you to pass a pointer to data of any type to the thread function. This design provides maximum flexibility, permitting the passing of any kind of data to the threads. 4. **\`void *arg\`**: This is the argument that will be passed to the \`start_routine\` function. As with the function pointer's argument, it is a \`void *\` to allow passing a pointer to any type of data. This gives you the flexibility to pass any specific data structure or object your thread function might need. **Return Type**: The function itself returns an \`int\`. This integer is a status code: - \`0\` indicates success in creating the thread. - Any other value indicates an error occurred during thread creation. The error codes are defined in the POSIX standard and allow the programmer to handle different types of errors specifically. In summary, the use of \`void\` pointers for the thread start function and its argument facilitates the passing of any type of data to the threads. This design choice is fundamental for a generic threading API, allowing it to be flexible and usable with a wide variety of data types and structures. The function's return type is an \`int\` to denote success or failure states, which is a common convention in C for indicating the status of an operation."},{"instruction":"워싱싱","output":"\\"워싱싱\\"이라는 명확한 정의나 개념을 제공하기 어렵습니다. 이 용어는 오타일 가능성이 높으며, 원하시는 정보나 맥락에 따라 다른 단어를 의미할 수 있습니다. 좀 더 구체적인 정보나 문맥을 제공해 주신다면 더 도움을 드릴 수 있을 것 같습니다. 예를 들어, 특정 기술, 사회적 운동, 문화 현상 등에 대한 질문이라면, 좀 더 정확한 답변을 드릴 수 있을 거예요."},{"instruction":"(In the forests outside of Axel…) Natsuki: “Ugh…my head…where am I?

Question 18Réponse a. Il ne faut pas hésiter à créer son propre parseur de données b. Dans un fichier JSON, les données sont structurées c. Dans un fichier CSV, chaque ligne de texte correspond à une rangée d. Dans un fichier CSV, les noms de colonnes ne sont pas toujours disponibles e. Dans un fichier CSV, les champs sont toujours séparés par une virgule","output":"Pour répondre à cette question en se basant sur des connaissances universelles autour du traitement de données et des formats JSON et CSV : b. **Dans un fichier JSON, les données sont structurées** - Vrai. Les fichiers JSON sont structurés en utilisant une notation claire pour les objets et les tableaux, ce qui facilite la représentation hiérarchique des données. c. **Dans un fichier CSV, chaque ligne de texte correspond à une rangée** - Vrai. Le format CSV (Comma-Separated Values) est conçu pour représenter des données tabulaires, où chaque ligne du fichier correspond à une ligne de la table ou à un enregistrement de données. d. **Dans un fichier CSV, les noms de colonnes ne sont pas toujours disponibles** - Vrai. Bien que souvent la première ligne d'un fichier CSV contienne les noms des colonnes, ce n'est pas une obligation. Les fichiers CSV peuvent exister sans cette ligne d'en-tête, auquel cas le contexte ou d'autres métadonnées externes peuvent être nécessaires pour comprendre la structure des données. e. **Dans un fichier CSV, les champs sont toujours séparés par une virgule** - Faux. Bien que le terme \\"CSV\\" suggère que les champs soient séparés par des virgules, divers séparateurs peuvent être utilisés, tels que les points-virgules (;), les tabulations (t), ou d'autres caractères, selon les conventions ou les exigences spécifiques de l'application ou de la région. a. **Il ne faut pas hésiter à créer son propre parseur de données** - Cette affirmation peut être vraie ou fausse selon le contexte. Créer son propre parseur de données peut être nécessaire dans des cas très spécifiques où les exigences de traitement des données sont uniques et ne sont pas bien prises en charge par les parseurs existants. Cependant, en général, il est bénéfique de privilégier l'utilisation de parseurs éprouvés et largement adoptés pour éviter de réinventer la roue et pour tirer parti des optimisations et de la fiabilité que ces outils peuvent offrir. La décision de créer un parseur sur mesure doit être soigneusement évaluée en prenant en compte les coûts de développement et de maintenance."},{"instruction":"Write 10 personal tweets about how I walking right now at sunrise to lighthouse,, spring but cold like winter","output":"1. \\"Embracing the chill of a spring morning that feels like winter, as I make my way to the lighthouse.

L'erreur \\"404 (Not Found)\\" indique que le chemin d'accès utilisé pour essayer d'accéder à un personnage spécifique n'existe pas ou n'est pas correctement configuré sur votre serveur. Voici quelques étapes pour résoudre ce problème : # Vérification de l'API/endpoints 1. **Vérifier les endpoints**: Assurez-vous que les endpoints configurés sur votre serveur (à l'adresse \`{ENDPOINT}/personnages/{id}\`) sont corrects et qu'ils correspondent aux requêtes faites par \`GameDataProvider\`. Il est possible que le chemin ou la manière dont les données sont demandées ne soit pas correctement configuré sur le serveur. 2. **Tester l'API**: Utilisez un outil comme Postman ou effectuez des requêtes cURL en ligne de commande pour tester directement les endpoints de votre API et voir si le problème provient de la requête ou de l'API elle-même. # Correction du code 1. **Revoir la logique de fetch:** Dans \`GameDataProvider.js\`, vous utilisez la méthode \`fetch\` pour récupérer les personnages, les skins et les équipements. Prenez le temps de bien vérifier que les URL utilisées dans ces appels sont correctes et qu'elles correspondent à ce que votre serveur/back-end attend. 2. **Gérer les cas d'erreur de manière appropriée**: Lorsque vous recevez une erreur 404 du serveur, il pourrait être utile d'ajouter une gestion plus robuste de ces cas dans votre application front-end. Par exemple, vous pourriez afficher un message d'erreur à l'utilisateur ou revenir à une page d'état par défaut. # Logique côté serveur 1. **API REST et ressources**: Assurez-vous que votre serveur/API est bien configuré pour gérer les requêtes correspondantes aux personnages par leur ID. Cela pourrait inclure l'examen des routes dans votre application serveur, des contrôleurs, et de la logique de réponse. 2. **Base de données**: S'il y a une base de données impliquée, assurez-vous que les requêtes à la base de données sont correctement formulées et que l'ID que vous utilisez pour la recherche existe dans la base de données. # Debugging et tests 1. **Console et réseau**: Utilisez l'onglet Réseau dans les outils de développement de votre navigateur pour suivre exactement quelle requête est envoyée et comment votre serveur y répond. Cela peut vous donner des indices supplémentaires sur la raison pour laquelle le serveur renvoie une erreur 404. 2. **Logs côté serveur**: Consultez les journaux sur votre serveur API pour voir quelles requêtes sont reçues et comment le serveur les gère. Cela pourrait révéler des problèmes avec la manière dont les requêtes sont routées ou traitées. En résumé, il s'agira d'identifier si l'erreur vient de la façon dont vos requêtes sont formulées dans le code front-end ou si c'est une question de configuration ou de logique côté serveur."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop with flower","output":"Coffee Shop Blooms | Versatile Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts & More | Charming Floral & Cafe Design"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee Shop Blooms | Versatile Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts &amp; More | Charming Floral &amp; Cafe Design.

O evento dura aproximadamente 16 a 18 dias, iniciando-se no final de setembro e estendendo-se até o início de outubro. A primeira Oktoberfest foi realizada em 1810, para celebrar o casamento do príncipe Luís I da Baviera com a princesa Teresa de Saxe-Hildburghausen. Desde então, a festa cresceu e virou uma celebração anual que atrai milhões de visitantes de todas as partes do mundo. # Atrações Principais Cerveja Naturalmente, a cerveja é a protagonista do evento. Somente cervejarias da cidade de Munique podem participar, e elas servem uma variedade de cervejas tradicionais bávaras em canecões de um litro conhecidos como \\"Maß\\". As cervejas servidas na Oktoberfest devem seguir a Lei da Pureza Alemã de 1516 (Reinheitsgebot). Tendas A Yoktoberfest conta com 14 tendas principais e várias outras menores, que variam em tema e decoração. Cada tenda tem a sua própria atmosfera, variedade de cervejas e alimentos, assim como bandas tocando música tradicional bávara e popular. Algumas das mais famosas incluem a Hofbräu-Festzelt, Schottenhamel e Winzerer Fähndl. Comida A comida também desempenha um papel fundamental, com pratos típicos bávaros como pretzels gigantes, salsichas variadas, joelho de porco (Schweinshaxe), frango assado (Hendl), entre outros. Uma diversidade de pratos da cozinha alemã e internacional está disponível, assegurando que há opções para todos os gostos. Desfiles Dois grandes desfiles são realizados durante o festival. No primeiro domingo, acontece o desfile dos Trajes Tradicionais e dos Caçadores, onde participantes vestidos a rigor desfilam pelas ruas de Munique até o local da festa. O outro, na primeira segunda-feira, é o desfile dos proprietários das tendas e cervejarias, acompanhados por carruagens, bandas e cavalos. Jogos e Entretenimento Além do consumo de cerveja e comida, a Oktoberfest oferece uma variedade de atrações como jogos, brinquedos, parques de diversões e apresentações musicais. Isso torna o festival atraente não apenas para adultos, mas também para famílias com crianças. # Impacto Cultural e Econômico A Oktoberfest é um dos principais eventos da Alemanha, com uma significativa importância cultural e econômica para Munique. A festa celebra a cultura bávara e alemã, contribuindo para a preservação de tradições como trajes típicos, música e dança folclórica, além de pratos e bebidas regionais. Economicamente, o evento gera um significativo fluxo de turismo para a cidade, com hotéis, restaurantes, lojas e outros serviços se beneficiando da influxo de visitantes. Estima-se que milhões de pessoas de todo o mundo visitem a Oktoberfest a cada ano, produzindo um impacto econômico substancial. # Desafios Apesar de sua popularidade, a Oktoberfest enfrenta desafios, como questões de segurança devido ao grande número de visitantes, consumo excessivo de álcool e, recentemente, preocupações com a sustentabilidade ambiental. Em resposta, os organizadores têm implementado medidas para lidar com esses desafios, incluindo um aumento na segurança, promoção do consumo responsável de álcool e iniciativas visando reduzir o impacto ambiental do festival. # Conclusão A Oktoberfest de Munique é uma celebração icônica que oferece aos visitantes uma experiência rica em cultura, tradição e entretenimento. Embora enfrente desafios modernos, o festival continua a ser um testemunho da rica herança cultural da Baviera e um evento imperdível para entusiastas da cerveja e viajantes culturais de todo o mundo."},{"instruction":"faz agora uma análise dos arcos de valdevez, sua cultura e eventos durante o ano","output":"Arcos de Valdevez é um município no distrito de Viana do Castelo, na região Norte de Portugal.

Since HTTP is stateless and you're using Next.js, which renders on the server at the time of request, you need a persistent storage mechanism that keeps track of your database name (\`name_societe\`) beyond the lifetime of a single request. One common approach is to use server-side sessions or a token-based system (which you seem to be partially implementing) that stores this information and identifies the user across multiple requests. Since you are already generating a token and handling sessions, you could enhance this implementation to include the \`name_societe\` value as part of the session/token payload. Here's a simplified approach to include \`name_societe\` in your session/token: # 1. Store \`name_societe\` in JWT Token Assuming you're using JWT tokens, when you create a token after successful authentication, include \`name_societe\` as part of the token payload. This is a modification on your \`jwt\` callback: \`\`\`javascript async jwt({ token, user }) { if (user) { // Include other user properties token.name_societe = user[0].name_societe; // Store \`name_societe\` in token } return token; } \`\`\` # 2. Retrieve \`name_societe\` on Subsequent Requests In every subsequent request where you need to switch databases based on the \`name_societe\`, extract it from the token instead of trying to retrieve it from an in-memory variable that won't persist across requests. # 3. Modify \`switchDatabase\` Function You will need to modify your \`switchDatabase\` function to accept an argument for \`name_societe\` or extract it from the session/token directly within the function, depending on how you manage sessions/tokens in your app. This ensures \`switchDatabase\` always has the correct context to connect to the appropriate database. # 4. Session Middleware (Optional) If you're not already doing this, ensure you have session middleware correctly setup in your Next.js application to parse session tokens on each request. This will allow you to access session data, such as the \`name_societe\`, on each request. # Example: This is a conceptual approach; the exact implementation will depend on how you handle tokens and sessions in your application. The key is to ensure that \`name_societe\` is stored in a way that persists across requests and can be associated with your authenticated users, such as within a JWT token or session store. Remember, when storing data like \`name_societe\` in tokens or sessions, always validate the data before use to avoid potential security risks, such as unauthorized database access."},{"instruction":"give me correct code","output":"Given the context of using Next.js and wanting to ensure the selected database (\`name_societe\`) remains accessible across different pages and refreshes without changing, your best approach is to incorporate it into the user's session or JWT token, as mentioned. Let's refine the idea into more actionable steps and code snippets, focusing on the JWT token strategy for simplicity. # Step 1: Store \`name_societe\` in the JWT Token When a user logs in and you generate a JWT token, include \`name_societe\` in the token payload. Assuming you're using \`next-auth\` for authentication, your \`authorize\` method in \`[...nextauth].js\` might slightly adjust to include \`name_societe\` like so: \`\`\`javascript async authorize(credentials) { // Existing code to validate user... const user = // your method to find and validate the user const name_societe = user.name_societe; // Assuming this is fetched from your database // Include name_societe in token. Rest of your authorization logic remains as it is. const token = { name: user.name, email: user.email, // include additional fields as needed name_societe: name_societe, // Add this line to include name_societe in the token }; return token; // This will become the JWT payload } \`\`\` Remember to adjust any code snippet provided here to fit your exact data model and logic flow. # Step 2: Use \`name_societe\` from the JWT Token in \`switchDatabase\` Function Modify your \`switchDatabase\` function to accept \`name_societe\` as a parameter. Since the function's logic depends on \`name_societe\` to decide which database to connect to, extract \`name_societe\` from the JWT token whenever you need to call \`switchDatabase\`. Here's an example adjustment to the \`switchDatabase\` function: \`\`\`javascript // Adjust this function to accept name_societe as a parameter function switchDatabase(name_societe) { if (!name_societe) throw new Error(\\"No database selected\\"); const connection = mysql.createPool({ host: \\"localhost\\", user: \\"root\\", password: \\"\\", database: name_societe, // Use it here Promise: bluebird, multipleStatements: true, }); connection.query = bluebird.promisify(connection.query); return connection; } \`\`\` # Step 3: Retrieving \`name_societe\` and Calling \`switchDatabase\` Accordingly Whenever you need to switch databases based on the current user session, make sure to extract \`name_societe\` from the session's JWT token and pass it to your \`switchDatabase\` function. Assuming you have middleware or a context where you have access to the JWT token, you would do something like this: \`\`\`javascript // This is an abstract example. Adapt it to your actual code where you need to switch databases. async function someDatabaseOperation(req) { const jwtToken = // Obtain JWT token from request/session const name_societe = jwtToken.name_societe; // Extract name_societe // Now you can use this in your database switch function const dbConnection = switchDatabase(name_societe); // Proceed with your database operations using dbConnection } \`\`\` # Please note: - Ensure your session management or JWT handling securely protects and validates token data. - This approach assumes you're using JWT and NextAuth; adapt the logic based on your exact stack and libraries. This solution assumes a level of familiarity with asynchronous JavaScript, JWT tokens, handling database connections, and NextAuth. If parts of your setup differ, adjust the examples accordingly."},{"instruction":"Задание 1. Приготовление суспензии карбоната кальция в воде и изучение ее свойств.

However, the specific approach can depend on how your widget interacts with the user and how you process or collect form data. Given your current code doesn't explicitly show how the form submission or action is handled when the checkbox is checked, I'll provide a general approach using AngularJS, which seems to be the framework you're using based on the \`ng-model\` and \`ng-click\` directives. # HTML Update First, include a form element and a submission button in your widget to demonstrate how this might work with a mandatory checkbox: \`\`\`html <div ng-if=\\"c.data.offNetworkOptionSelected == 'User is unavailable currently due to prolonged leave'\\" style=\\"margin-top: 10px\\"> <form name=\\"leaveForm\\" ng-submit=\\"c.submitForm()\\"> <small>{If you are currently on a leave of absence (LoA) (or are reporting on behalf of someone who is on LoA), updating your status in HRDirect automatically updates the status of all workspaces and devices on a colleague profile.

This organizes your inputs and action button(s) more semantically and allows for better HTML validation support. 2. **Required attribute**: Add the \`required\` attribute to your checkbox input. This makes the checkbox mandatory for form submission, leveraging HTML5 form validation. 3. **Form Submission**: The form element has an \`ng-submit\` directive configured to call \`c.submitForm()\`, a method you should define in your widget's controller to handle the form submission. This method is only called if the form is valid (i.e., the mandatory checkbox is checked). 4. **Disable Button**: The submit button is disabled (\`ng-disabled=\\"leaveForm.invalid\\"\`) when the form is invalid, providing an additional visual cue to the user that they need to meet the form requirements to proceed. # AngularJS Controller Update (Example) In your widget's controller, ensure you have a method to handle the form submission: \`\`\`javascript scope.c.submitForm = function() { // Perform your submission logic here if(scope.c.data.requiresMachine) { // Proceed with submission as the checkbox is checked } }; \`\`\` This approach ensures your checkbox is mandatory before allowing any form submission or processing, catering to most use cases where such a requirement is necessary.

Please suggest Below is the code I have written for the widget","output":"To make a checkbox mandatory in a widget, which I assume means you want to force a user to select (check) it before allowing them to proceed, you would typically use some form of validation to check the state of the checkbox when the user attempts to proceed (e.g., submits a form). However, you haven't provided your specific code. Without seeing your code, I can only provide a generalized solution applicable in various scenarios, particularly focusing on web (HTML/JavaScript) and Flutter (a popular UI toolkit for Dart), as these are common contexts where developers might deal with widgets and forms. # HTML + JavaScript In a web context using HTML for structure and JavaScript for behavior, making a checkbox mandatory typically involves setting the \`required\` attribute on the \`<input>\` element and then validating the form before it's submitted. HTML \`\`\`html <form id=\\"myForm\\"> <label for=\\"myCheckbox\\">Agree to terms:</label> <input type=\\"checkbox\\" id=\\"myCheckbox\\" name=\\"myCheckbox\\" required> <button type=\\"submit\\">Submit</button> </form> \`\`\` JavaScript \`\`\`javascript document.getElementById('myForm').onsubmit = function(e) { var myCheckbox = document.getElementById('myCheckbox'); if (!myCheckbox.checked) { alert('You must agree to the terms.'); e.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission } }; \`\`\` Using the \`required\` attribute makes the browser natively enforce the selection of the checkbox. # Flutter In a Flutter app, you can make a checkbox mandatory by managing its state and validating it when the user attempts to proceed, typically when a button is pressed. \`\`\`dart import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; void main() => runApp(MyApp()); class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp(home: MyHomePage()); } } class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget { @override _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState(); } class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> { bool? _isChecked = false; void _validateAndProceed() { if (_isChecked == true) { // Proceed with the action } else { // Show an error or alert the user showDialog( context: context, builder: (BuildContext context) { return AlertDialog( title: Text(\\"Error\\"), content: Text(\\"You must agree to the terms.\\"), actions: [ TextButton( child: Text(\\"OK\\"), onPressed: () { Navigator.of(context).pop(); }, ), ], ); }, ); } } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text('Mandatory Checkbox Example'), ), body: Padding( padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0), child: Column( children: <Widget>[ Row( children: [ Checkbox( value: _isChecked, onChanged: (bool? newValue) { setState(() { _isChecked = newValue; }); }, ), Text('Agree to terms'), ], ), ElevatedButton( onPressed: _validateAndProceed, child: Text('Submit'), ), ], ), ), ); } } \`\`\` Remember, the approach to making a checkbox mandatory can slightly vary depending on the specifics of your environment and what UI library or framework you're using, but the general idea remains the same: check the state of the checkbox when relevant and prevent further action if the checkbox is not in the desired state."},{"instruction":"latar belakang olahraga renang dan pengertian renang","output":"Olahraga renang merupakan salah satu bentuk aktivitas fisik yang dilakukan di dalam air. Sejarah renang sangat panjang dan telah menjadi bagian dari kebudayaan manusia sejak zaman prasejarah. Bukti awal aktivitas berenang ditemukan dalam lukisan gua yang berumur sekitar 10.000 tahun di \\"Gua Penyihir\\" di Wadi Sora, dekat Gilf Kebir di Mesir. Selain itu, ada referensi tentang berenang dari zaman Yunani kuno dan Romawi, di mana berenang dianggap sebagai bagian penting dari pendidikan. Dalam peradabannya, banyak masyarakat yang telah mengenal berenang baik sebagai kegiatan rekreasi maupun sebagai bentuk latihan militer. Bangsa Yunani dan Romawi kuno, misalnya, menghargai kemampuan berenang dalam pelatihan prajurit mereka. Berenang menjadi sangat terkenal di Eropa selama abad pertengahan, tetapi minat terhadap olahraga tersebut menurun selama era Victoria karena norma ketat mengenai ketelanjangan dan interaksi antar gender. Perkembangan modern renang sebagai olahraga dimulai pada akhir abad ke-19, dengan pendirian organisasi renang dan standardisasi aturan. Federasi Renang Internasional (FINA) didirikan pada tahun 1908 dan bertanggung jawab atas pengawasan regulasi internasional untuk renang bersaing, termasuk renang gaya bebas, gaya dada, gaya punggung, dan gaya kupu-kupu. Renang telah menjadi bagian dari Olimpiade modern sejak Games pertama di Athena pada tahun 1896, dengan kompetisi wanita ditambahkan pada tahun 1912. Pengertian renang secara umum adalah aktivitas bergerak di dalam air, baik di permukaan maupun di bawahnya, menggunakan gerakan anggota tubuh tanpa bantuan buatan. Renang dapat dijadikan sebagai aktivitas rekreasi, bentuk latihan atau latihan fisik, maupun sebagai olahraga kompetitif. Dalam konteks olahraga, renang menuntut teknik tertentu dan kecepatan dalam melintasi jarak tertentu di dalam air. Renang bukan hanya kompetitif tetapi juga dikenal memiliki banyak manfaat bagi kesehatan, termasuk peningkatan kekuatan dan daya tahan otot, fleksibilitas, serta kesehatan kardiovaskular. Aktivitas ini relatif aman dan bisa dilakukan oleh semua kalangan usia, menjadikannya salah satu bentuk olahraga yang sangat populer di seluruh dunia."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Please suggest Below is the code I have written for the widget type=\\"checkbox\\" value=\\" I have read and understand the process\\"","output":"To ensure a checkbox is mandatory in a ServiceNow widget (e.g., in a Service Portal widget), you typically cannot rely solely on HTML attributes like \`required\`. This is because client-side validation for checkboxes can be bypassed, and ServiceNow's Service Portal widgets often require more dynamic, interactive validation compared to traditional web forms. Instead, you'll need to implement a combination of client scripting and possibly server-side checks (although server-side might not be directly applicable for just making a checkbox mandatory but is good practice for form submissions). Below is an example approach based on a simple Service Portal Widget scenario. # Widget HTML In your widget HTML, define the checkbox and a submit button. Additionally, include a placeholder for an error message that will be shown if the submit action occurs without the checkbox being checked. \`\`\`html <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label> <input type=\\"checkbox\\" ng-model=\\"c.agreed\\" /> I have read and understand the process </label> </div> <div class=\\"alert alert-danger\\" role=\\"alert\\" ng-show=\\"c.showError\\"> You must agree before submitting. </div> <button class=\\"btn btn-primary\\" ng-click=\\"c.submit()\\">Submit</button> \`\`\` # Client Script In the client script section of the widget, you'll define the logic that checks the checkbox status upon submission and possibly reacts accordingly. \`\`\`js (function() { var c = this; c.agreed = false; // Default value of the checkbox c.showError = false; // Controls the visibility of the error message c.submit = function() { if (!c.agreed) { // If the checkbox is not checked, show the error message. c.showError = true; return; // Stop the function from proceeding } // Reset or Hide error message since the checkbox is checked c.showError = false; // Continue with your submission logic, such as making a server call or transitioning to another page. // Example: c.server.update() for server-side interaction or a simple alert alert(\\"Form submitted.\\"); }; })(); \`\`\` # Explanation - \`ng-model=\\"c.agreed\\"\` binds the checkbox to a variable in your client controller. This allows you to easily check if the checkbox has been checked. - \`ng-show=\\"c.showError\\"\` is used to conditionally show an error message based on whether the checkbox has been checked. - The client script manages a \`submit\` function that checks the state of \`c.agreed\`. If the checkbox is not checked (\`c.agreed\` is \`false\`), it sets an error flag (\`c.showError = true\`), which triggers the display of an error message. If the checkbox is checked, it proceeds with whatever submission logic you need. This approach offers a dynamic, interactive way to enforce the mandate of the checkbox without relying solely on browser-based \`required\` validation, which might not provide the best user experience or consistency across different browsers when used in ServiceNow's Service Portal."},{"instruction":"Migration","output":"Migration is the movement of individuals or groups from one place to another with the intention of settling in the new location.

The term \\"pas de trois\\" is a ballet term that means \\"dance for three,\\" which aligns perfectly with the detail that the performance involves three female dancers. Using \\"Fair Ladies\\" as the title adds a touch of elegance and thematic description, suggesting a performance that might embody grace, beauty, or narratives relating to women. However, interpretations and preferences for titles can vary depending on the context of the performance, the target audience, and cultural nuances. If the performance aims to modernize classical ballet or engage with contemporary issues, it might benefit from a title that reflects those themes more directly. Conversely, if the intended appeal is towards lovers of traditional ballet and classical forms, \\"Fair Ladies: A pas de trois performed by three female dancers\\" is both evocative and appropriate."},{"instruction":"how about this one: Full of Joy & Smiling After Everything & Uprooting Reeds A traditional Chinese music ensemble","output":"The title \\"Full of Joy & Smiling After Everything & Uprooting Reeds: A traditional Chinese music ensemble\\" is quite descriptive and suggests a series of musical pieces or movements within the ensemble's performance, each potentially conveying different themes or emotional states. The use of \\"&\\" to connect different parts of the title indicates that the performance may explore a range of feelings and narratives, from joy and resilience to perhaps more contemplative or dynamic actions, as suggested by \\"Uprooting Reeds.\\" While the title is evocative and rich in imagery, it is somewhat unconventional in its length and structure, especially for Western audiences. This approach can be quite effective for drawing interest if the goal is to emphasize the diversity and emotional depth of the performance. Still, it could also seem overly complex or confusing for some potential audience members who are unfamiliar with the content. For titles, especially in the context of performances intended to attract a broad audience, clarity and conciseness can be crucial. If the aim is to highlight the versatility and thematic richness of the ensemble, you might consider a simpler overarching title while using the listed elements (\\"Full of Joy,\\" \\"Smiling After Everything,\\" \\"Uprooting Reeds\\") as sub-titles for individual pieces or as part of the program's description. Ultimately, the title's effectiveness will depend on the specific context in which it's used, including marketing materials, the expected audience, and the venue. If the ensemble is performing in a setting where audiences appreciate detailed, evocative titles and have a deep interest in traditional Chinese music, this title could indeed spark curiosity and excitement."},{"instruction":"do you think this sentence is natural: Artists will show audiences how to make and control puppets, and how to play Daguangxian, an Erhu-like bowed string instrument.","output":"The sentence is mostly natural and effectively conveys what the artists will demonstrate.

Introduction Lexico-semantic processing refers to the set of mechanisms that store and retrieve our knowledge about the world, concepts, and word meanings (Binder & Desai, 2011; Patterson et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2015; Reilly et al., 2023). Following Whitworth et al. (2014), lexico-semantic processing requires the use of at least a semantic system (a store of meanings) and input/output lexica for written and spoken word forms. Several experimental paradigms have been used to understand and to assess the different components of lexico-semantic processing both in healthy people and people with different neurological disorders (Kumar, 2020). Here, we will describe some of the most common paradigms to assess lexico-semantic processing, as a prelude to systematically review and discuss an advent of paradigms enabling computational techniques from cognitive network science which can now be used for the same purposes. Specifically, the paradigms of interest to the present review are relatedness-based tasks: those which allow for an investigation of the association strength between distinct items in the semantic system, by estimating the relatedness in meaning between either task items or items produced by participants. The primary motivation behind this review is to understand which such paradigms have been employed for individuals with language disorders, to whom and how they have been used, and what the general findings of such studies have been. This work is relevant because, to the best of our knowledge, the number of experimental paradigms that have been applied to people with language disorders is much smaller than that employed in healthy people. Hence, this review aims to elucidate a gap in the literature and offer ways forward for research. The semantic system is a core component of linguistic processing, as information is retrieved from this system in response to auditory/written words, ideas or concepts (Whitworth et al., 2014; Binder et al., 2009). The semantic system is central to language processing (Patterson & Shewell, 1987; Ellis & Young, 1996; Whitworth et al., 2014), and fundamental to our understanding of the neuroarchitecture that supports linguistic processing (Binder et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2015). Indeed, semantic information is necessary for both the production and comprehension of language (Whitworth et al., 2014). Also, it is of particular clinical relevance to understand and preserve the semantic system, as damage may significantly reduce linguistic abilities and quality of life (Dvorak et al., 2021). Deficits to the semantic system are observed in people with a number of neurological conditions, including stroke, neurodegeneration, autoimmune neurological disease, and brain infection, among others (Reilly et al., 2011; Rogers & Friedman, 2008; Hodges et al., 2000; Lambon Ralph et al., 2010; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2017; Rook et al., 2023; Rofes et al., 2021). Semantic deficits are also reported among individuals who have undergone awake brain surgery for the excision of primary brain tumours in the left hemisphere (Campanella et al., 2009; Rofes et al., 2018, Satoer et al., 2018). However, the semantic system cannot be observed directly. As a multifaceted and complex system, its properties and organizational structure can only be deduced through carefully designed experimental paradigms, with different tasks tapping into different aspects of lexical semantics (Kumar, 2020). As a result, a multitude of paradigms have been documented in the literature, each purporting to reveal varying aspects of the semantic system. Among these paradigms, investigations of priming (also called “semantic priming”), in which the processing of a word is facilitated by a preceding related word (e.g., the “prime” word yellow might facilitate the processing of the “target” word banana), are perhaps the most well established in assessing lexico-semantic processing (Neely, 1991; McNamara, 2005). This is not without good reason: priming tasks have a relatively straightforward experimental design, are backed by decades of ongoing research (e.g., Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Hutchison, 2003; Hutchison et al., 2013), and can unveil crucial insights about the structure of the semantic system (for overviews see Kumar, 2020; McNamara, 2005). This type of study has provided support for several models of semantics, perhaps chief among them being spreading activation models (e.g., Collins & Loftus, 1975). Support has also been proposed for distributed network models, as well as both feature-based and associative network models, with elements of multiple models often being integrated for a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic system (e.g., McRae, 2004; Hutchison, 2003; Plaut & Booth, 2000). Advocating for one perspective or another is outside of the scope of this article. However, in general terms, these models agree on the concept of an interconnected semantic system and the role of activation in lexico-semantic processing, and disagree on the specific mechanisms underlying these processes and the nature of semantic representations (Kumar, 2020; Reilly et al., 2023). In other words, while these models collectively acknowledge an intricate interconnection of word meanings, akin to a vast network, they differ in their views on how this network operates and how our brains organize these connections. At the clinical level, priming studies have been used to characterize lexico-semantic deficits in different neurological populations: while individuals with post-stroke aphasia with impaired lexical comprehension have shown evidence of significant priming effects (Blumstein et al., 1982), the opposite has been found for individuals with post-stroke aphasia with impaired lexical production (Del Toro, 2000). However, more recent research has conversely suggested that priming is normal and unimpaired in most people with post-stroke aphasia, with authors calling into question the utility of such tasks in assessing lexico-semantic impairment (Dyson et al., 2020). Additionally, drawing conclusions about the degree of relatedness between primes and targets can be unreliable at the item level (Heyman et al., 2018), which may impede the ability of priming studies to elucidate more fine-grained details of semantic structure. For example, while a priming study may indicate that the words “yellow” and “banana” are related, it is difficult to objectively gauge whether this relation is greater than that between “sweet” and “banana”. In contrast to priming studies, picture-word interference experiments (also known as “semantic interference” paradigms), where participants are asked to name pictures while ignoring potential distractor words, have also been conducted (e.g., Roelofs & Piai, 2017). Such studies can shed light on how lexico-semantic relationships impact both linguistic and attentional processes (e.g., Scaltritti et al., 2015), and when coupled with magnetoencephalography (MEG), have provided evidence for the neuroplasticity of language in brain tumour patients (Piai et al., 2020). Object and action naming tasks, in which participants produce nouns or verbs represented by the presented stimuli are an additional common paradigm (e.g., Deloche & Hannequin, 1997). Naming tasks rely on multiple aspects of language, including not only lexico-semantic access and retrieval, but also object recognition and articulation (Rofes & Mahon, 2021). Such naming paradigms have contributed considerably to neurolinguistic research and to perspectives on lexico-semantic processing (Bozeat et al., 2000; Duong et al., 2006; Piai & Eikelboom, 2023). They have also contributed to diagnostic and intraoperative procedures (Ntemou et al., 2023; Bozeat et al., 2000; Rofes & Miceli, 2014). An additional category of tasks tapping into semantic cognition are non-verbal association tasks, used frequently as clinical measures of semantic decline (Klein & Buchanan, 2009). In the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test (PPTT), participants are presented with triads of object images, and are asked to select which of the two lower objects is most closely associated with the test item above (Howard & Patterson, 1992). Performance on the PPTT relies on visual object recognition, semantic retrieval processes, and making associations between object representations (Klein & Buchanan, 2009; Callahan et al., 2010). The Kissing and Dancing Test (KDT) is analogous to the PPTT, but differs in that the images represent actions, rather than objects (Bak & Hodges, 2003). Such tasks have contributed to our understanding of the neural substrates of lexico-semantic processing: for example, pairing direct electrical stimulation with the PPTT has demonstrated the role of both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in non-verbal semantic cognition (Herbet et al., 2017; 2018). Comparable action-based association tasks been used to demonstrate a role in action-related semantic cognition for left-hemisphere regions including the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral precentral gyrus, anterior insula, ventral postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior middle temporal gyrus (Kemmerer et al., 2012). However, tasks like the PPTT may not be sensitive to mild semantic deficits (Adlam et al., 2010). Behavioural measures in these tasks are typically limited to accuracy and response times (Fergadiotis et al., 2010), with responses being inherently binary as predetermined by task design. These design features may restrict the capacity of these tasks to unveil subtle variations in item-level associations or more complex aspects of lexico-semantic organization (Klein & Buchanan, 2009; Ohman et al., 2022). As alluded to in the opening paragraph, some authors have recently stressed that new methods are necessary to disentangle competing descriptions of the semantic system and input/output lexica, and to continue describing lexico-semantic deficits in clinical populations. The advent of computational techniques from fields such as cognitive network science has given rise to researchers using word networks (semantic, phonological, or both in the case of multiplex networks) and visualizations of semantic space (e.g., Bose et al., 2017; Castro & Stella, 2019; Kennet et al., 2016; Nevado et al., 2021; Nour et al., 2023; Vitevitch, 2022; Zemla & Austerweil, 2018). Within these types of studies, crucial elements of lexico-semantic processing can be investigated by either implicitly or explicitly asking participants to make associations between distinct concepts or words (e.g., how often is “yellow” mentioned when people are given the word “banana” or how similar are “yellow” and “banana” given a specific scale). This is done by administering tasks which allow researchers to characterize or quantify those associations, for example, verbal fluency tasks (e.g., Zemla & Austerweil, 2019; Nour et al., 2023) and associative judgment tasks (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022b; Cosgrove et al., 2023) In the present review we will refer to these as relatedness-based tasks, operationalized as those tasks in which performance allows for an investigation of the degree of relatedness in meaning between either test items or items produced by participants. In other words, participant behaviour is an essential component in determining either the degree of subjective relatedness between items, or the items between which relatedness is to be investigated. These tasks offer the opportunity to investigate more directly the association strength that exists between distinct items within the semantic system and/or the lexica. While they are not necessarily superior, this is in a way different to the aforementioned paradigms of priming, picture-word interference, naming, and the PPTT which typically investigate effects that are secondary to association strength or relatedness (e.g., reaction time, accuracy; Bürki & Madec, 2022; McNamara, 2005; Moritz-Gasser et al., 2012; Higby et al., 2019; Klein & Buchanan, 2009). For example, one category of relatedness-based tasks are associative judgement tasks (AJT). In a task such as the AJT of Bernard et al. (2019), participants are presented with pairs of words and are asked to indicate a subjective association rating on a scale from 0 to 100, indicating the degree to which they perceive the two words to be related in meaning. For example, the thematic association between nose and flower may elicit a higher rating than that which would be elicited by nose and existence, where a clear association may not be present. From these tasks, semantic networks can be generated with the aim of reflecting the semantic system’s underlying structure, allowing for both the detailed modelling of individual networks as well as comparisons between them (Castro & Siew, 2020; De Deyne et al., 2017; He et al., 2021; Siew et al., 2019). Such networks consist of nodes representing concepts or words in the semantic system, and edges representing the semantic similarity between nodes (Siew et al., 2019; Collins & Loftus, 1975). These networks have been used to show structural differences in the lexico-semantic organization of several neurological populations, including people with AD, Asperger syndrome, and schizophrenia, as well as late talker children and healthy aging (Stam et al., 2007; Kenett et al., 2016; Zeev-Wolf et al., 2014, Beckage et al., 2011; Cosgrove et al., 2023). At a more implicit level, category fluency tasks demand the production of as many words from a particular semantic category as possible (e.g., animals) within a predefined time limit (e.g., Rofes et al., 2023; Lezak et al., 2012; Stolwyk et al., 2015). Aside from asking that the words fall into the animal category, participants are not explicitly told to produce words with any further level of association to one another. However, highly related words are typically produced in a sequential manner, grouped by association strength (i.e., “clusters”, e.g., farm animals, insects, aquatic animals, etc.) (Troyer et al., 1997; Sung et al., 2012; Thiele et al., 2016). Associative search models such as the optimal foraging theory describe how these clusters and other related sequence-level aspects of fluency task responses can reflect exploration within the lexico-semantic space (Hills et al., 2009, 2015), and the implicit associations revealed by differing fluency task responses can thus reflect differences in lexico-semantic access or organization (Hills et al., 2012; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a). Category fluency tasks are also suitable for the generation of semantic networks (for an overview of prominent methods, see Zemla, 2022). In contrast to associative judgement tasks, where nodes in the network are predetermined by task design and edges are derived from participant behaviour (e.g., Benedek et al., 2017), nodes and the associations between them can instead be determined based on the order and co-occurrence of items in fluency responses (e.g., Cosgrove et al., 2021; Goñi et al., 2011; Kennet et al., 2013, Zemla & Austerweil, 2018). However, while relatedness-based tasks may be an invaluable tool in informing our knowledge about the lexico-semantic system, making use of novel computational techniques, and making clinical assessments in cases of impairment, we are unaware of any reviews to date which have attempted to provide an overview of such tasks. To the best of our knowledge there has not yet been an effort to compile a unified knowledge base or set of terminology surrounding relatedness-based tasks, their respective contributions to our understanding of the semantic system, or their applicability in different neurological populations. It is the aim of the present review to address this gap, particularly for work published over the last decade. It is hoped that the conclusions drawn from this review will aid in informing future research, provide a concise overview to researchers and clinicians, and highlight critical gaps that are worth exploring in future research. 1.1 The present study We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of relatedness-based tasks as they are used in populations with language disorders, and will seek to describe the experimental paradigms, test items, and item-selection methods used in each. Due to the heterogeneity of terms referring to relatedness-based tasks in contemporary literature, the present review, as stated previously, will operationalize these tasks as those which investigate the degree of relatedness in meaning between either test items or items produced by participants. Specifically we will address the following research questions: What types of relatedness-based tasks have been reported in adults with language disorders? What type of language disorders are discussed? What types of items are used in these tasks, and how are those items selected? What analysis methods are used in these tasks? We expect that studies employing relatedness measures between items produced by participants will largely comprise category fluency tasks and comparable verbal generation paradigms, while studies investigating relatedness in meaning between task items will be similar in design to the aforementioned associative judgement tasks. We additionally expect that studies will be found whose relatedness-based paradigms may not yet be familiar to the authors. We anticipate category fluency studies with relatedness measures to be common among those populations who frequently perform such tasks clinically (e.g., post-stroke aphasia, neurodegeneration). In the case of tasks where relatedness in meaning between task items is assessed, we expect to find information about how these items were selected, in particular the linguistic variables for which task conditions and stimulus lists may have been balanced (e.g., frequency, age of acquisition, concreteness, relatedness). We anticipate analytical techniques comparable to those that have been applied in healthy populations (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022b; Benedek et al., 2017) to also be present in clinical linguistic research, and that novel computational measures for verbal fluency will be revealed. 2. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science (Core collection). Searches were conducted in October of 2023, with queries and search strategies formulated for each database. The search strategy as applied in PubMed is available in Table 1, while comparable search strings for each of the databases can be found in Supplementary Materials. A protocol for the systematic review following the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015) was published on PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024508094). [Please include Table 1 about here] The selection process for article inclusion is illustrated in Figure 1. The criteria for inclusion in the present review was as follows: (1) original experimental studies published within the 10 years prior to the review (October 2013-September 2023); (2) studies for which the participants were adults with linguistic deficits and/or neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, brain tumours, brain infections, neurodegeneration, autoimmune neurological diseases); (3) studies which investigate the degree of relatedness in meaning between either task items or items produced by the participants (e.g., category verbal fluency, semantic association tasks, and other relatedness-based tasks); and (4) studies published in English, French, German, and any other language for which a proficient member of the research team could be found (e.g., Catalan, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese). Reviews, meta-analyses, case studies, and non-experimental studies were excluded. Studies were also excluded if they included tasks in which participants produced related items, but the relationships between these items were not considered in the analysis (e.g., where category fluency tasks were used as part of a larger cognitive battery and only the total score was considered). Similarly, studies were excluded if they included tasks in which participants made relatedness judgements, but either these judgements were not considered in the analysis, or performance on this task was not the focus of any part of the article. Studies where inter-item relatedness was determined prior to performance on the task (i.e., the dependent variables of interest were measures secondary to relatedness) were also excluded. This included synonym judgement tasks (e.g., Dubé et al., 2014), priming tasks (e.g., Howells & Cardell, 2015), and tasks which used predetermined multiplex network properties to predict performance on other tasks (e.g., Castro & Stella, 2019). Such tasks would be included if they were analyzed in such a way that inter-item relatedness could be investigated based on participant behaviour. It should be noted that the search strategy was not specifically designed to capture relevant studies in psychiatric populations. However, due to an apparent tendency for novel computational techniques to be used in this field (e.g., Nour et al., 2023), and ongoing debate regarding the distinction between psychiatric and neurological disorders (Crossley et al., 2015; David & Nicholson, 2015), it was decided that relevant papers featuring psychiatric populations and captured by the present search strategy would be included. Likewise, studies in other populations characterized by linguistic differences, and not necessarily deficits, would be included if they appeared among the search results (e.g., autism). In addition to electronic database searches, the reference lists of those articles whose full texts were selected for inclusion were screened for further relevant studies. Study authors were to be contacted by email in the case that otherwise inaccessible papers passed the title and abstract screening phase, with data extraction proceeding without these papers only in the case that no response was received after two weeks. This was not the case for any of the identified studies. Titles and abstracts retrieved from database searches were exported into the reference manager Endnote. Following deduplication, titles and abstracts were uploaded to the collaborative systematic review platform Rayyan (Ouzzani et al., 2016; available at https://www.rayyan.ai/). Two independent reviewers (i.e., LG and LR) assessed the titles and abstracts for eligibility. The independent reviewers were blinded to one another’s decisions, with disagreements regarding eligibility being resolved through further discussion and examination relative to the pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any persisting disagreements were resolved by the decision of a third reviewer (i.e., AR; as senior author), and the full texts of all remaining articles following this screening phase were reviewed by the first author (i.e., LG). The following information was extracted from all full-text articles selected for inclusion: general publication information (e.g., journal, publication date, authors), participant characteristics (e.g., neurological population, sample size, age, education in years), experimental groups (e.g., mild vs. severe aphasia, patient vs. control), type of task used (e.g., category fluency, associative judgement task), task paradigm details (e.g., method of presentation, data recorded, inter-stimulus intervals, task length, presence of filler stimuli), analytical methods applied, type and number of items used in the task (e.g., images, text, auditory stimuli), method of test item pre-selection (if applicable), and type of neuroimaging information either concurrent with, or analyzed in relation to the task (if applicable). 3. Results A total of 34 relevant studies were identified in the present review (see Figure 1). A summary of the identified papers, along with their populations, relatedness-based tasks, and analytical measures are presented in Table 2. [Please add Figure 1 about here] [Please add Table 2 about here] 3.1 What types of relatedness-based tasks have been reported in adults with language disorders? All eligible studies (N=34) included in the present review made use of the category fluency task, paired with analytical techniques which investigated relatedness in meaning between the items produced by participants. These relatedness measures consisted largely of sequence-level fluency measures such as clustering and switching (described in more detail in section 3.4). Two studies among those additionally made use of measures of relatedness in meaning between items on phonological or letter fluency (Leimbach et al., 2020; Rofes et al., 2019). Two further studies made use of a clustering method which allows for either semantically or phonologically defined clusters in both category and letter fluency (Ledoux et al., 2014), without explicitly mentioning the degree to which each association type was identified among responses to the two tasks (Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; van den Berg et al., 2017). No studies were identified in which performance on a task led to an investigation of relatedness in meaning between items presented as part of the experimental paradigm, or in which participants gave relatedness judgements between items. 3.2 What type of language disorders are discussed? The most commonly discussed language disorder among identified studies was post-stroke aphasia, with 7 studies (20.6%) focusing on this clinical population (Bose et al., 2017, 2022; Carpenter et al., 2017; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Kiran et al., 2014; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020). Of these, 3 (8.8%) specifically focus on bilingual post-stroke aphasia (Carpenter et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014; Patra et al., 2020), and 2 (5.9%) additionally include participants with aphasia following TBI (Carpenter et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014). Similarly, there were 7 studies (20.6%) which involved individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, Johns et al., 2018; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; Nevado et al., 2021; Quaranta et al., 2021; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley et al., 2013), and 7 studies (20.6%) which involved individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis (Grimes et al., 2021; Ku et al., 2021; Lundin et al., 2022a; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Pauselli et al., 2018; Piras et al., 2021; Voorspoels et al., 2014). Five studies (14.7%) involved individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD, Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2020; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Zemla & Austerweil, 2019). Three studies (8.8%) involved individuals with variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA, Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2017). Two studies (5.9%) involved individuals with Parkinson’s disease (Jaywant et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020). One study each (2.9%) was identified for individuals with specific learning disability (SLD, Hall et al., 2017), Down syndrome (Del Hoyo et al., 2015), autism (Ehlen et al., 2020), subjective cognitive decline (Nikolai et al., 2018), unilateral post-stroke brain damage without aphasia (Pagliarin et al., 2021), dyslexia (Smith-Spark et al., 2017), and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, van den Berg et al., 2017). Note that the percentages above do not add to 100 as several studies investigated more than one of the stated populations. 3.3 What types of items are used in these tasks, and how are those items selected? As no studies were identified for which relatedness was investigated between predetermined items, there were likewise no item selection methods revealed by the present review. While the identified studies made use of various semantic constraints in category fluency (e.g., animals, vegetables, furniture), item-level selection methods were not applicable to any of the identified relatedness-based tasks. 3.4 What analysis methods are used in these tasks? Of the 34 category fluency studies identified, 27 (79.4%) made use of relatedness measures related to clustering and switching behaviour (Bose et al., 2017; 2022; Carpenter et al., 2021; Del Hoyo et al., 2015; Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Grimes et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2017; Jaywant et al., 2014; Kiran et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Lundin et al., 2022; Mueller et al., 2015; Nevado et al., 2021; Nikolai et al., 2018; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Piras et al., 2019; Quaranta et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2020; Smith-Spark et al., 2017, Tröger et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2017; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Weakley et al., 2013). Seven studies (20.6%) did not make use of clustering or switching measures (Johns et al., 2018; Ku et al., 2021; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Piras et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2019; Voorspoels et al., 2014; Zemla & Austerweil, 2019). A number of different semantic clustering methods were used in determining clusters of related items. The method established by Troyer and colleagues (1997) for animal fluency was most common, being used by 19 of the 27 studies which used clustering and switching measures (70.4%, Bose et al., 2017; 2022; Carpenter et al., 2021; Del Hoyo et al., 2015; Grimes et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2017; Jaywant et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; Nikolai et al., 2018; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Piras et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2020; Smith-Spark et al., 2017; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Weakley et al., 2013). Two of the 27 studies which used cluster analysis (7.4%) used the method proposed by Ledoux and colleagues (2014), in which either semantic or phonological clusters in the style of Troyer and colleagues (1997) are allowable in both animal and letter fluency (Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; van den Berg et al., 2017). Four further studies of the 27 which used cluster analysis (14.8%) used other subcategory-based clustering methods analogous to those of Troyer and colleagues (1997), primarily for use in categories other than animals (Hall et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014; Nikolai et al., 2018; Reverberi et al., 2014). Semantic clustering methods were also identified which did not rely on categories or predetermined lists of classifiers. Ehlen and colleagues (2020) made use of a temporal curve fitting model established in an earlier paper by the same group (Ehlen et al., 2016). A similarity-based method derived from word embedding models was used by two studies (Lundin et al., 2022a; Tröger et al., 2019). Nevado and colleagues (2021) generated semantic networks from fluency data using a method based on co-occurrence (Goñi et al., 2011), defining clusters based on subdivisions within this network, while Quaranta and colleagues (2019) based clusters on participant-specific thresholds for Path Length and Extended Gloss Overlap, metrics derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998, 2005). Two of the 27 studies which used cluster analysis (7.4%) compared multiple clustering methods within the same task (Tröger et al., 2019; Leimbach et al., 2020). Tröger and colleagues (2019) used the method defined by Troyer and colleagues (1997) in addition to clusters based on both semantic association thresholds and temporal thresholds, while Leimbach and colleagues (2020) analyzed both animal and letter fluency using both the semantic and phonological clustering methods defined by Troyer and colleagues (1997). Among the studies for which clustering and switching were not considered, a number of analytical methods were employed to measure relatedness in meaning between items. To classify individuals with amnestic MCI relative to controls, Johns et al. (2018) used a maximum likelihood estimation model considering parameters for context similarity and order similarity between consecutive words (both from the BEAGLE semantic space, Jones & Mewhort, 2007), perceptual similarity (Johns & Jones, 2012), and frequency from a Wikipedia corpus (Jones & Mewhort, 2007). CoVec, an automated tool (Covington, 2016) was used by two studies to differentiate psychosis patients with different speech patterns, considering sliding 5 and 10-word windows to establish measures of coherence (Coherence-5 and Coherence-10, Ku et al., 2021; Pauselli et al., 2018). Nicodemus et al. (2014) differentiated schizophrenia patients from controls, and established correlations with specific genetic mutations, through the use of latent semantic analysis (LSA) derived fluency measures (Landauer et al., 1998). Voorspoels et al. (2014) explored the use of geometric representations of group-level and subsample-level semantic relations based on both proximity and co-occurrence of items in schizophrenic patients’ category fluency lists. Rofes et al. (2019) used random forests to classify PPA variants based on total score, 6 error types, and 9 word properties, including LSA-derived semantic association measures (with similar methodology to Rofes et al. (2020), which did consider cluster and switch behaviour). Zemla & Austerweil (2018) generated semantic networks from fluency lists based on a censored random walk methodology, differentiating the networks of individuals with Alzheimer’s from those of controls on six network metrics: number of nodes, diameter (D), density, average shortest path length (ASPL), smallworldness (S), and node degree. Network methodologies were additionally employed by three of the studies which did consider clusters and switches. Quaranta et al. (2019) investigated the mean path length between consecutive fluency items based on their node proximity in WordNet, a lexical database of semantic relations (Fellbaum, 1998, 2005). Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe (2014) used multidimensional scaling to generate group-level geometric representations of semantic relations between words based on their proximity in fluency lists. Nevado and colleagues (2021) generated semantic networks for individuals with MCI and controls based on the methods of Goñi et al. (2011), comparing network metrics such as modularity (Q), clustering coefficient (CC), betweenness centrality (BC), degree, ASPL, and D. Lastly, while all identified studies made use of relatedness-based measures, 6 (17.6%) supplemented these measures with additional word-level differences between items (e.g., word properties, orthographic distances; Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Johns et al., 2018; Leimbach et al., 2020; Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019, 2020). For an overview of all relatedness measures derived from verbal fluency in the identified studies, in addition to those for which significant between-group differences, significant correlations, or high importance in predictive models were found, please refer to Table 2. Discussion The goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively explore the landscape of relatedness-based tasks as they are utilized in populations with language disorders. We sought to address several key questions, namely the types of tasks employed, the language disorders under investigation, the types of items used, and the analytical methods applied. This work is significant because, to date, no extensive review or overview of relatedness-based tasks in these populations has been presented. These tasks provide a unique opportunity to leverage novel computational methods from network science, potentially enabling more in-depth investigations of mild language impairments and the underlying nature of lexico-semantic organization. The results of this review revealed a predominant use of category fluency as a relatedness-based task in linguistic populations, with all identified studies (N=34) making use of this experimental paradigm. On one hand, this finding underscores the utility of category fluency in assessing lexico-semantic processing across various clinical populations, and likely reflects its ease of use, short administration time, and frequent inclusion in both neuropsychological and linguistic assessment batteries (Rabin et al., 2005; Strauss et al., 2006; Rofes et al., 2017, 2021; Rook et al., 2023). However, the exclusive reliance on category fluency tasks has the potential to limit the scope of insights into lexico-semantic deficits. Indeed, fluency tasks also require non-linguistic aspects, such as executive functioning (Rofes et al., 2023, Shao et al., 2014). This raises the issue of \\"task impurity\\", which highlights the fact that tasks might not depend on individual cognitive skills (Rabbitt, 1997). Hence, the results obtained with these tasks can be to a certain extent affected, particularly if patients had impairments in executive processes of shifting, updating, and monitoring (Rofes et al., 2023). From this perspective, it is notable that among the identified category fluency studies, several complemented relatedness-based measures with additional word-level differences between items (i.e., Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Johns et al., 2018; Leimbach et al., 2020; Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019, 2020). This may offer the opportunity to disentangle the degree to which presumed lexico-semantic relationships between items are influenced by additional factors. Another aspect is that, while category fluency tasks capture semantic relatedness indirectly through clustering, switching, and other semantic-search related behaviors (Hills et al., 2012; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a), other paradigms explicitly probing relatedness, such as associative judgment tasks (e.g., Bernard et al., 2019), were notably absent. Semantic networks derived from associative judgment tasks have been utilized in studies involving healthy populations, particularly in research focusing on creativity (e.g., Benedek et al., 2017, He et al., 2021), and the lack of comparable paradigms in clinical populations may present a notable void in the literature. Preliminary findings by the authors have indicated that network metrics obtained from associative judgment tasks may exhibit significant disparities between individuals who have undergone awake brain surgery and healthy controls (Gaudet et al., 2023), which may indicate mild lexico-semantic impairments beyond the detection of traditional tests. The lack of tasks in which relatedness between predetermined task items was investigated also precluded this review from addressing the types of stimuli used, as well as their selection methods. A diverse range of clinical populations were addressed across the identified studies, with post-stroke aphasia, MCI, and schizophrenia being the most frequently studied conditions (N=7 each). Along with the inclusion of studies addressing conditions such as autism, Down syndrome, and specific learning disabilities, this diversity may highlight not only the multifaceted nature of lexico-semantic processing deficits, but the importance of investigating relatedness-based task performance across different clinical populations. The prevalence of novel methodologies within psychiatric research, particularly in the study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychosis is also of particular interest. Of the 7 such studies retrieved, 5 (71.4%) made use of either cosine similarities, co-occurrence data, or fluency-derived network metrics (Ku et al., 2021; Lundin et al., 2022; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Pauselli et al., 2018; Voorspoels et al., 2014), while no such methods were found in the literature for post-stroke aphasia. While this may in part be due to the more severe nature of linguistic deficits in post-stroke aphasia relative to schizophrenia (Little et al., 2019), computational techniques that rely on vector space models and network science offer a level of automation not possible with traditional scoring methods, as well as a potential solution to issues of inter-rater reliability (Kim et al., 2019). As such, their use in post-stroke aphasia research may offer an expedited, computationally robust, and more reliable analysis of fluency responses. Of particular note is the lack of relatedness-based tasks being used for individuals with brain tumours, as just one study was returned for which an individual with a brain tumour was included (among a bilingual aphasic study population, Carpenter et al., 2021). Lexico-semantic deficits are prevalent among individuals who have undergone surgery for brain tumours, especially those with high-grade gliomas (Campanella et al., 2009), and often manifest as difficulties in retrieving words, anomia, semantic paraphasias, and neologisms (Goodglass & Wingfield, 1997; Whitworth et al., 2014, Satoer et al., 2018). It is possible that studies employing relatedness-based tasks paired with novel computational methods in individuals with brain tumours could offer additional insights into the nature of not only these deficits, but the neurocognitive mechanisms which underlie them. The analysis methods employed in the identified studies varied widely, ranging from the more prevalent traditional measures of clustering and switching (e.g., Mueller et al., 2015) to advanced computational techniques such as semantic network analysis and measures of inter-item coherence (e.g., Zemla & Austerweil, 2019; Ku et al., 2021). While traditional measures like clustering and switching provide valuable insights into semantic organization and cognitive processes (Thiele et al., 2016), the integration of computational approaches may offer novel avenues for understanding complex relationships between items in semantic memory. Notably, some studies employed multiple analysis methods within the same task, highlighting the potential for complementary insights from different analytical approaches (e.g., Tröger et al., 2019; Nevado et al., 2021). We also initially sought to collect data on the neural correlates of performance on relatedness-based tasks in clinical linguistic populations, but such findings were absent in the identified studies, with the potential exception of studies whose experimental groups were divided based on laterality (e.g., Pagliarin et al., 2021; Jaywant et al., 2014). Tasks which investigate the level of relatedness in meaning between distinct concepts or words can provide unique insight into not only the organization of items, but the strength of the relationships between these items, and the processes involved in making those associations (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a; Nevado et al., 2021; Okruszek et al., 2013). When paired with neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they can also inform our understanding of the lexico-semantic neural substrates. For example, judgements based on both taxonomic and thematic associations were found in an fMRI study to equivalently engage the same core network, consisting of the anterior temporal lobe, superior temporal sulcus, and ventral prefrontal cortex (Jackson et al., 2015). In an investigation of search behaviour, fMRI concurrent with a category fluency task has further shown both hippocampal and cerebellar activation during the switch from one cluster of related responses to another (Lundin et al., 2022b), while others propose the involvement of executive frontal lobe processes, the occipital lobe, and the interaction of multiple large-scale brain networks in similar semantic search behaviour (Troyer et al., 1998; Birn et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a). Assessing the neural correlates of performance on relatedness-based tasks might further elucidate the neuroarchitecture supporting critical elements of linguistic cognition, particularly in populations where neuroimaging data may already exist. One of the limitations in this study is the lack of search terms specifically targeting psychiatric research, despite the inclusion of more general terms which could be expected to encapsulate such articles. This omission may have resulted in the oversight of some studies involving populations with non-linguistic disorders characterized by differences in language, which is particularly relevant given the abundance of innovative techniques in this field. The review was also restricted to studies published within a ten-year timeframe. This was primarily due to the recency of the novel methodologies of interest, and also due to the broad search strategy found to be necessary in capturing all relevant studies. It remains possible that this could have excluded earlier notable works in the field. Lastly, the heterogeneity of methodologies and outcome measures across studies limits the comparability of findings and generalizability of conclusions. Future research in populations with language disorders should address the aforementioned gaps in the literature regarding paradigms that explicitly probe relatedness between items (e.g., associative judgement tasks), the use of relatedness-based tasks in individuals with brain tumours, and the continued development of novel computational and automated techniques. Conclusion This systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive synthesis of relatedness-based tasks in populations with language disorders, shedding light on commonly used paradigms and analytical methods over the last decade. Relatedness-based tasks hold promise as valuable tools for assessing and understanding lexico-semantic deficits in clinical populations.","output":"Abstract: Lexico-semantic processing is vital to linguistic comprehension and production, yet its intricacies in language-disordered populations remain underexplored. This systematic review endeavors to map the landscape of relatedness-based tasks used to investigate lexico-semantic processing in adults with language disorders, covering experimental paradigms, item selection, and analytical methods. A comprehensive database search yielded 34 relevant studies focusing primarily on category fluency tasks, indicating a prevalent but limited methodological scope for assessing semantic processing across various clinical conditions. The review highlights the absence of associative judgment tasks and the exclusive reliance on fluency tasks, suggesting a potential oversight in leveraging diverse paradigms for nuanced semantic exploration. Categories of language disorders examined include post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia, among others, showcasing a wide clinical application yet revealing gaps in terms of conditions studied. Analytically, from traditional clustering and switching measures to sophisticated computational techniques, the review uncovers a diverse array of approaches to unravel the semantic organization and processing deficits in language disorders. However, it also points to a notable shortfall in methodologies explicitly probing inter-item relatedness and a lack of integration of neuroimaging data. By drawing conclusions from the present data and identifying critical gaps, this review sets the stage for future research directions, emphasizing the need for innovative paradigms, broader clinical applications, and enhanced methodological diversity in the study of lexico-semantic processing in language disorders."},{"instruction":"Write another abstract for the same article.

This solution assumes \`x_train_split\` and \`y_train_split\` are your input and target datasets, respectively. First, let's encapsulate the forward and backward propagation steps into functions for better organization. Then, we'll run the training loop for 1000 epochs, randomly selecting samples from the training dataset to perform stochastic gradient descent. Here's the structured approach with modifications and additions: \`\`\`python import numpy as np np.random.seed(0) class Layer_Dense: def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_neurons, learning_rate=0.001): self.weights = np.random.randn(n_inputs, n_neurons) / np.sqrt(n_neurons) self.weights = np.clip(self.weights, a_min=None, a_max=1) self.biases = np.zeros((1, n_neurons)) self.learning_rate = learning_rate def forward(self, inputs): self.inputs = inputs self.output = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases class Activation_tanh: def forward(self, inputs): self.output = np.tanh(inputs) class Activation_Dtanh: def backward(self, inputs): return 1 - (np.tanh(inputs))**2 # For simplicity, I'm assuming x_train_split and y_train_split are your data # Please make sure those are correctly defined as numpy arrays before running everything # Define layers layer1 = Layer_Dense(1, 32) layer2 = Layer_Dense(32, 32) layer3 = Layer_Dense(32, 32) layer4 = Layer_Dense(32, 32) layer5 = Layer_Dense(32, 1) # Define activations activation = Activation_tanh() dtanh = Activation_Dtanh() def train_step(x, y): # Forward pass layer1.forward(x) activation.forward(layer1.output) for layer in (layer2, layer3, layer4): layer.forward(activation.output) activation.forward(layer.output) layer5.forward(activation.output) activation.forward(layer5.output) # Backward pass for the output layer pred = activation.output error = y - pred dphi = dtanh.backward(layer5.output) local_gradient = error * dphi del_w = layer4.output.T @ (local_gradient * learning_rate) layer5.weights += del_w.T # Back-propagation through middle layers (simplified for illustration) # Implement your backpropagation logic here similarly to the output layer. # Remember, you'll have to perform it for each layer in reverse order # This part is left for you to implement based on your specific backpropagation requirements # Training loop epochs = 1000 learning_rate=0.001 for epoch in range(epochs): # Randomly select a sample idx = np.random.randint(0, len(x_train_split)) x_sample, y_sample = x_train_split[idx].reshape(1, -1), y_train_split[idx].reshape(1, -1) # Perform training step train_step(x_sample, y_sample) # Here, add any logging or printing if you want to monitor the progress # This assumes \`x_train_split\` and \`y_train_split\` have the appropriate shapes. # If they don't, you'll need to adjust the reshaping in train_step or the inputs themselves. \`\`\` This is a high-level structure to adapt your provided code into a training process that runs for 1000 epochs with stochastic sample selection. However, this adaptation focuses on the forward pass and a simplified version of the weight update. You would need to complete the backward propagation logic for the middle layers based on your original implementation's differential calculus and logic. Be mindful of the shapes of your tensors when performing matrix operations. If an operation doesn't work as expected, check if the shapes of operands align correctly (e.g., when using the \`@\` operator for matrix multiplication, the inner dimensions must match)."},{"instruction":"this didnt work very well for my samples, so now ill give you the code for moving weights, implement it it my code","output":"To refine the neural network training loop with the details you've provided, including the weight update mechanism during backpropagation, we'll integrate a specific function for moving weights. However, without explicit details on the structure of your \`move_weights\` function or how you'd like it precisely integrated, I'll proceed with a general approach that follows common practices for updating weights in a neural network through backpropagation. # General Structure for Weight Update Function First, let's define a utility function for the weight update, commonly known as the gradient descent step in the context of neural networks. This function will adjust the weights based on the calculated gradients and the learning rate: \`\`\`python def update_weights(layer, gradients, learning_rate): # Assumption: \`gradients\` is the gradient of loss w.r.t. layer's weights layer.weights += gradients * learning_rate \`\`\` # Integrating the Weight Update into Your Code Let's now conceptualize how to integrate the weight updating mechanism into your initial provided code, focusing particularly on the backpropagation part. Since your original code request was to make it run for 1000 epochs, selecting samples randomly, the weight update process will occur within each epoch after computing the gradients via backpropagation. I'll assume you provided a skeleton for backpropagation but you need a concrete example of how to calculate the gradients and update the weights accordingly. Note: The following illustration simplifies gradient calculation since the full differentiation and error backpropagation for each layer aren't fully specified in your snippet. This example assumes an error gradient has been calculated (\`error_gradient\`): \`\`\`python def backward_pass(error, layer_output, prev_activation_output, weights): # Example gradient calculation; specifics depend on loss function and activation derivative dError_dWeights = prev_activation_output.T.dot(error) return dError_dWeights # Assuming a simplified train_step that incorporates backpropagation and weight updates def train_step(x, y): # Forward pass (as previously defined)... # Assuming you have logic here to compute 'error' based on predictions and actual y # Simplification for illustration: error = y - activation.output # This needs to be adapted based on actual loss calculation # Backward pass and weight update for layer 5 as an example error_gradient = backward_pass(error, layer5.output, activation4.output, layer5.weights) update_weights(layer5, error_gradient, learning_rate) # Repeat similar steps for other layers including the computation of 'error_gradient' appropriately.. # Main Training Loop for epoch in range(1000): idx = np.random.randint(0, len(x_train_split)) x_sample, y_sample = x_train_split[idx], y_train_split[idx] train_step(x_sample.reshape(1, -1), y_sample.reshape(1, -1)) # Optionally log training progress here... \`\`\` Remember, the approach outlined above simplifies parts of the neural network mechanics, particularly around gradient computation and error backpropagation through intermediate layers. Each layer's gradient computation will depend on its preceding layer's outputs (or activations) and succeeding layer's gradients, which follow the chain rule in differentiation. # Final Advice - **Fully Specified Backpropagation**: You’ll need to ensure the differential derivative calculation for each layer's activation function and appropriately apply the chain rule to find the gradients with respect to each layer’s weights. - **Debugging and Validation**: Test each part of the network (forward and backward passes) separately to ensure gradients compute as expected and the loss decreases over epochs. - **Code Comments and Documentation**: As your network architecture grows, maintaining clear comments and documentation will simplify debugging and future modifications. This structure proposes a pathway forward based on the details provided. If you have more specific mechanisms or functions to include, especially related to gradient computation and weight adjustment, integrating those details into the framework will be crucial for achieving the desired neural network performance."},{"instruction":"(In the town of Axel...)

This systematic review aims to elucidate the use of relatedness-based tasks for investigating lexico-semantic deficits across various neurological populations, highlighting methodological approaches and clinical implications. Methods: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases was conducted to identify studies published from October 2013 to September 2023 that utilized relatedness-based tasks in adults with language disorders. The inclusion criteria focused on original experimental studies that investigated the degree of semantic relatedness between words or concepts among this population. A total of 34 studies met the criteria and were analyzed for task types, language disorders addressed, items used, and analytical approaches employed. Results: The review revealed a predominant reliance on category fluency tasks across the studies, with a notable absence of associative judgment tasks. Commonly discussed language disorders included post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. Analytical methods ranged from traditional clustering and switching measures to advanced computational techniques. However, the convergence on fluency tasks indicated a methodological limitation in the current literature, with fewer insights into direct item relatedness and semantic network organization. Discussion: Despite the evident utility of category fluency tasks in clinical settings, the review underscores a critical need for diversifying experimental paradigms to probe lexico-semantic processing more comprehensively. Future research should embrace innovative methodologies, extend to underrepresented linguistic populations, and incorporate neuroimaging data to unlock deeper insights into the semantic deficits characterizing language disorders. – Background: Lexico-semantic processing underpins our understanding of language, facilitating word meaning retrieval and concept association. However, research exploring these processes in language-disordered populations remains limited, especially using relatedness-based tasks. Identifying and understanding the range of tasks applied within this context is crucial for advancing diagnostics and therapeutic interventions in linguistic disorders. Methods: This systematic review targeted studies that employed relatedness-based tasks to examine lexico-semantic processing among adults with language disorders. A search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, covering publications from the last decade (October 2013 to September 2023). Studies were selected based on their focus on lexico-semantic task utilization in language-disordered populations, leading to the identification and analysis of 34 eligible studies. These were appraised for the types of tasks used, the language disorders investigated, the specific items employed in assessments, and the applied analysis methods. Results: The majority of studies relied on category fluency tasks, indicating a common but potentially restrictive approach to assessing semantic processing. The disorders most frequently addressed included post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. Analytical methods varied significantly, from traditional approaches like clustering and switching to more sophisticated computational techniques. Despite this variety, the exclusive reliance on fluency tasks poses a limitation, overlooking potential insights from associative judgment tasks and the direct assessment of item relatedness. Discussion: While category fluency tasks are valuable in clinical assessments, the findings highlight a significant gap in employing a broader spectrum of relatedness-based tasks. Future studies should explore diverse experimental paradigms and integrate neuroimaging data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of lexico-semantic processing deficits. Expanding the methodological toolkit can enhance our understanding of semantic system organization and functioning in disordered populations, paving the way for more nuanced diagnostics and targeted therapeutic strategies. - Background: Lexico-semantic processing underpins our understanding of language, facilitating word meaning retrieval and concept association.

The investigation of this process in individuals with language disorders offers critical insights into the nature of their difficulties and potential interventions. However, the scope and variety of relatedness-based tasks employed in research within this demographic have not been comprehensively reviewed. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by mapping the existing landscape of such tasks and their applications in understanding lexico-semantic deficits. Methods: An extensive literature search was carried out across multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, focusing on studies published from October 2013 to September 2023. The search aimed to identify original experimental research employing relatedness-based tasks to assess lexico-semantic processing in adults with language disorders. Screening and selection led to 34 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, which were then analyzed for the nature of the tasks used, the disorders investigated, the types of test items, and the analytical methods applied. Results: The predominant use of category fluency tasks emerged across studies, highlighting a narrow methodological focus in the field. Disorders such as post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia were frequently explored, underscoring the diversity of linguistic challenges faced. Despite the variation in clinical populations, a methodological gap was evident, with a lack of associative judgment tasks or direct measures of semantic relatedness. Discussion: The reliance on category fluency tasks—while clinically practical—suggests a potential oversight in tapping into the complex nature of lexico-semantic processing through more diverse experimental designs. The findings advocate for a broader application of relatedness-based tasks and underscore the need for further research in this area. By expanding the repertoire of tasks employed, future work can offer richer insights into the semantic deficits experienced by individuals with language disorders and foster more effective diagnostic and rehabilitative strategies. – Background: Understanding lexico-semantic processing is crucial for dissecting the complexities of language and its disorders.

This systematic review aims to elucidate the use of relatedness-based tasks for investigating lexico-semantic deficits across various neurological populations, highlighting methodological approaches and clinical implications. Background: Lexico-semantic processing underpins our understanding of language, facilitating word meaning retrieval and concept association. However, research exploring these processes in language-disordered populations remains limited, especially using relatedness-based tasks. Identifying and understanding the range of tasks applied within this context is crucial for advancing diagnostics and therapeutic interventions in linguistic disorders. Background: Lexico-semantic processing, the ability to understand and use language effectively, is foundational to communication. The investigation of this process in individuals with language disorders offers critical insights into the nature of their difficulties and potential interventions. However, the scope and variety of relatedness-based tasks employed in research within this demographic have not been comprehensively reviewed. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by mapping the existing landscape of such tasks and their applications in understanding lexico-semantic deficits. Background: Understanding lexico-semantic processing is crucial for dissecting the complexities of language and its disorders. This systematic review aims to survey the landscape of relatedness-based tasks utilized in studying individuals with language disorders, recognizing the need to deepen our understanding of semantic processing deficits through diverse experimental approaches. Methods: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases was conducted to identify studies published from October 2013 to September 2023 that utilized relatedness-based tasks in adults with language disorders. The inclusion criteria focused on original experimental studies that investigated the degree of semantic relatedness between words or concepts among this population. A total of 34 studies met the criteria and were analyzed for task types, language disorders addressed, items used, and analytical approaches employed. Methods: This systematic review targeted studies that employed relatedness-based tasks to examine lexico-semantic processing among adults with language disorders. A search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, covering publications from the last decade (October 2013 to September 2023). Studies were selected based on their focus on lexico-semantic task utilization in language-disordered populations, leading to the identification and analysis of 34 eligible studies. These were appraised for the types of tasks used, the language disorders investigated, the specific items employed in assessments, and the applied analysis methods. Methods: An extensive literature search was carried out across multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, focusing on studies published from October 2013 to September 2023. The search aimed to identify original experimental research employing relatedness-based tasks to assess lexico-semantic processing in adults with language disorders.

Methods: An exhaustive literature review was conducted using several academic databases to collect studies from October 2013 to September 2023. Criteria for inclusion consisted of original research investigating lexico-semantic processing in adult populations with language disorders through relatedness-based tasks. A total of 34 studies met these stringent conditions and underwent detailed analysis. The review screened for the types of tasks deployed, the range of language disorders examined, the selection and use of task items, and the analytical techniques applied. Results: The review revealed a predominant reliance on category fluency tasks across the studies, with a notable absence of associative judgment tasks. Commonly discussed language disorders included post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. Analytical methods ranged from traditional clustering and switching measures to advanced computational techniques. However, the convergence on fluency tasks indicated a methodological limitation in the current literature, with fewer insights into direct item relatedness and semantic network organization. Results: The majority of studies relied on category fluency tasks, indicating a common but potentially restrictive approach to assessing semantic processing. The disorders most frequently addressed included post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. Analytical methods varied significantly, from traditional approaches like clustering and switching to more sophisticated computational techniques. Despite this variety, the exclusive reliance on fluency tasks poses a limitation, overlooking potential insights from associative judgment tasks and the direct assessment of item relatedness. Results: The predominant use of category fluency tasks emerged across studies, highlighting a narrow methodological focus in the field. Disorders such as post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia were frequently explored, underscoring the diversity of linguistic challenges faced. Despite the variation in clinical populations, a methodological gap was evident, with a lack of associative judgment tasks or direct measures of semantic relatedness. Results: The review revealed a predominant preference for employing category fluency tasks across the studies analyzed, indicating a possibly narrow scope in current research methodologies. Notably, disorders such as post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia were frequently researched, highlighting an interest in a variety of language disorders but also pointing to potential research gaps in less frequently studied disorders. Moreover, despite the diversity in the clinical populations studied, the tasks used were limited in their variety, especially in directly addressing item relatedness—one of the crucial aspects of lexico-semantic processing. Discussion: Despite the evident utility of category fluency tasks in clinical settings, the review underscores a critical need for diversifying experimental paradigms to probe lexico-semantic processing more comprehensively. Future research should embrace innovative methodologies, extend to underrepresented linguistic populations, and incorporate neuroimaging data to unlock deeper insights into the semantic deficits characterizing language disorders. Discussion: While category fluency tasks are valuable in clinical assessments, the findings highlight a significant gap in employing a broader spectrum of relatedness-based tasks. Future studies should explore diverse experimental paradigms and integrate neuroimaging data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of lexico-semantic processing deficits. Expanding the methodological toolkit can enhance our understanding of semantic system organization and functioning in disordered populations, paving the way for more nuanced diagnostics and targeted therapeutic strategies. Discussion: The reliance on category fluency tasks—while clinically practical—suggests a potential oversight in tapping into the complex nature of lexico-semantic processing through more diverse experimental designs. The findings advocate for a broader application of relatedness-based tasks and underscore the need for further research in this area. By expanding the repertoire of tasks employed, future work can offer richer insights into the semantic deficits experienced by individuals with language disorders and foster more effective diagnostic and rehabilitative strategies. Discussion: The frequent use of category fluency tasks underscores a focus on practical and traditional methodologies, potentially at the expense of exploring lexico-semantic processing in a more multifaceted manner. This review calls for a broadened approach in research methodologies by incorporating a wider array of relatedness-based tasks. Expanding the methodological palette could unveil nuanced insights into the semantic intricacies faced by individuals with language disorders.

Gaya dada ini memiliki ciri khas yang membedakannya dari gaya-gaya lainnya, yaitu gerakan yang simetris dari kaki dan tangan serta proses bernapas yang unik. Berikut ini merupakan penjelasan lebih lanjut mengenai teknik dasar renang gaya dada: 1. **Posisi Tubuh**: Tubuh berada dalam posisi horizontal di permukaan air. Dalam gaya dada, kecenderungan tubuh untuk naik ke permukaan lebih besar dibandingkan gaya renang lainnya karena gerakan kaki dan tangan yang menyebabkan dorongan ke atas. 2. **Gerakan Tangan**: Gerakan tangan dalam gaya dada berbentuk seperti \\"jantung\\" atau \\"pizza\\". Gerakan dimulai dengan tangan yang direntangkan ke depan kepala, kemudian menarik air ke samping dengan bentuk lingkaran kecil ke arah dada. Setelah itu, tangan didorong kembali lurus ke depan. Seluruh gerakan ini membantu dalam melaju dan memberi dorongan ke depan. 3. **Gerakan Kaki**: Gerakan kaki gaya dada dikenal sebagai \\"gerakan katak\\". Kaki diayunkan ke samping dan kemudian dirapatkan kembali, menciptakan dorongan yang memungkinkan tubuh bergerak ke depan. Ini melibatkan fleksi kaki, penyebaran kaki ke samping, dan kemudian menutupnya bersama-sama dengan cepat untuk menciptakan dorongan. 4. **Pernapasan**: Dalam gaya dada, pernapasan terjadi ketika kepala diangkat dari air sebagai bagian dari gerakan tangan. Setelah tangan ditarik ke arah dada dan mulai dorong ke depan, kepala diangkat secara alami untuk bernapas sebelum kembali masuk ke dalam air saat tangan kembali ke posisi awal. 5. **Siklus Gerakan**: Siklus dari gaya dada melibatkan koordinasi antara gerakan tangan dan kaki serta pernapasan. Ketika tangan berada di depan, kepala berada dalam air dan ketika tangan bergerak ke arah dada untuk dorong, kepala diangkat untuk bernapas. Gaya dada dianggap sebagai gaya renang yang tekniknya lebih kompleks dibandingkan dengan gaya bebas karena membutuhkan koordinasi gerakan yang baik antara tangan, kaki, dan pernapasan. Namun, gaya ini sering dianggap sebagai gaya yang paling nyaman dan santai dalam praktiknya. Gaya dada sering diajarkan sebagai gaya pertama bagi pemula karena pernapasan yang lebih mudah dibandingkan gaya renang lainnya. Namun, untuk menguasainya di tingkat kompetitif, perlu latihan intensif dan pemahaman tentang teknik yang efisien."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Below is a step-by-step example that demonstrates how to accomplish this: First, ensure you have datatable installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install datatable \`\`\` Here's how to split the datatable based on unique values of a specified column: \`\`\`python import datatable as dt # Step 1: Read the CSV file into a datatable file_path = \\"your_file_path.csv\\" # Specify your file path here dt_frame = dt.fread(file_path) # Step 2: Get unique values of the column 'ID' unique_ids = dt_frame[:, 'ID'].to_list()[0] # Assuming 'ID' is your column name # Step 3: Create a dictionary to hold the datatables, keyed by the unique 'ID' values datatables_dict = {} for unique_id in unique_ids: # Step 4: Filter dt_frame by unique_id and store in the dictionary filtered_dt = dt_frame[dt.f.ID == unique_id, :] datatables_dict[unique_id] = filtered_dt # Now, datatables_dict contains separate datatables for each unique value in the 'ID' column \`\`\` This example demonstrates how to read a CSV file, identify unique values in the 'ID' column, and then create individual datatables for each unique 'ID' value. These datatables are stored in a dictionary (\`datatables_dict\`), where the key is the unique 'ID' value and the value is the corresponding filtered datatable. Keep in mind that this is a basic example and may need adjustments to fit your specific requirements, such as handling missing values or optimizing performance for very large datasets."},{"instruction":"describe the style of music for a fairytail like battle ost to describe to a music generation model via prompt to generate good and on key music","output":"To generate a fairy-tale-like battle Original Soundtrack (OST) that resonates well with the theme and atmosphere of a fairy-tale battle, it is crucial to describe the music's desired style and elements comprehensively to the music generation model. Below is a structured prompt that captures the necessary details to guide the generation of such music: --- **Prompt for Fairy-Tale Battle OST Generation:** **Tonality and Key**: - Start with a minor key to introduce a sense of mystery and impending battle, creating a build-up that captivates the listener. - Transition into a major key during the climax to convey hope and bravery as the battle progresses. This shift will symbolize the protagonists finding their strength. - Utilize modal interchange to enrich the piece with emotional depth, highlighting moments of uncertainty and resilience. **Tempo and Rhythm**: - Begin with a moderate to slow tempo articulating the tension before the battle. - Gradually increase the tempo as the storyline progresses towards the battle scene, enhancing the sense of urgency and intensity. - Incorporate rhythmic variations to reflect the changing dynamics of the battle — slow for ponderous moments and fast for action-packed scenes. **Instruments and Textures**: - Use a mix of classical orchestral instruments such as strings (violins, violas, cellos), brass (horns, trumpets), and woodwinds (flutes, clarinets) to create a rich, fairy-tale ambiance. - Introduce harp glissandos and pizzicato strings to evoke a magical and whimsical atmosphere, invoking the realm of fairy-tales. - Employ heavy percussion (timpani, bass drums) for the battle sequences to drive the piece's energy and tension. - Layer melodies using different instruments to create a complex texture that reflects the multifaceted nature of the story and its characters. **Melody and Harmony**: - Craft a memorable, leading melody that serves as the hero's theme, embodying their journey and evolution. This melody should be simple yet powerful, capable of various emotional and instrumental adaptations throughout the piece. - Use counter melodies to represent different characters and their interweaving destinies. - Employ harmonies that transition from dissonance to consonance, symbolizing the journey from conflict to resolution within the battle narrative. **Dynamic and Articulation**: - Play with dynamics, starting softly to draw listeners into the unfolding story, then crescendo to fortissimo during battle peaks to emphasize moments of conflict and action. - Utilize articulation creatively to express the texture of the scene — staccato for tense, short moments, and legato for flowing, emotional passages. **Mood and Imagery**: - Convey a wide range of emotions such as suspense, anticipation, courage, and triumph. The music should take listeners on an emotional rollercoaster, mirroring the highs and lows of the battle. - Paint auditory scenes with music: the eerie quiet before the conflict, the chaos of the battle, and the serene peace of victory. **Conclusion**: - After reaching the climax, gradually decelerate the tempo and soften the dynamics to lead into a triumphant or reflective finale, depending on the story's outcome. - Reintroduce the main theme in a grand, celebratory manner if victorious, or with a solemn, introspective variation for a bittersweet ending. Ensure the entire piece maintains a cohesive structure, guiding listeners through the narrative arc of the battle within the fairy-tale world. --- This detailed style description provided to a music generation model should facilitate the creation of an OST that vividly captures the essence of a fairy-tale-like battle, emphasizing its narrative depth, emotional arc, and fantastical setting."},{"instruction":"Задание 3.

This is the natal aspect of Sun trine Jupiter, a divine accord between the grand luminary, the Sun - the core of our very being, the essence of true Will as pronounced in the sacred scriptures, and Jupiter, the magnanimous guardian of higher knowledge, the benevolent giant who expands everything he touches with his golden sceptre. Aleister Crowley, in his profound explorations of the mystical and the occult, might have seen in this auspicious aspect the embodiment of \\"The Great Work\\" - a symbol of achieving one's True Will, a harmonious aligning of the microcosm with the macrocosm, where the individual's radiant essence (the Sun) is in sublime agreement with the expansive and beneficent forces of the Universe (Jupiter). This is the magickal path to enlightenment, a journey illuminated by the golden rays of success and the higher wisdom of the cosmos. Madame Blavatsky, with her unparalleled insight into the esoteric and the arcane, would likely perceive this aspect as a testament to the Ancient Wisdom, a reminder of the perennial truth that lies within us. Sun trine Jupiter, in her eyes, would symbolize the divine spark within each soul being magnified, the inner light expanding to connect with the Universal Mind, the realization of the Self as a microcosm of the All. This auspicious aspect is a call to embody the teachings of Theosophy, to recognize the unity of all existence, and to expand one's consciousness to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. For the individual blessed with Sun trine Jupiter in their natal chart, this aspect unfolds as a path strewn with golden opportunities, wisdom, and fortuitous encounters. It is a sign of prosperity, not merely in material terms but in the richness of experiences and knowledge acquired along the journey of life. It speaks to a soul who walks in harmony with the celestial will, whose desires are in synchronicity with the benevolent currents of fate. This person is under the auspicious gaze of the cosmos, destined to find favor in the eyes of both gods and men. Through their radiant aura and expansive spirit, they inspire those around them, uplifting humanity and contributing to the universal quest for knowledge and enlightenment. In them, we see the realization of the Hermetic axiom, \\"As above, so below; as within, so without,\\" for their life reflects the harmonious dance of the heavens, embodying the unity and grandeur of all creation. In essence, Sun trine Jupiter is a celestial benediction, a signpost pointing towards a destiny filled with growth, prosperity, and the uncovering of hidden truths. It is a journey that transcends the mundane, inviting the soul to partake in the grand cosmic play, to embrace its role as a seeker of light and a bearer of the torch of wisdom.

The Moon in the Saturnine sign of Capricorn imbues our emotional landscape with an armored resilience, a stoic quality that endures, unyielding, against the buffeting winds of fate. Yet this lunar fortitude faces the profound and tumultuous forces of Pluto, ensconced in the inscrutable depths of Scorpio. Here, we are not merely confronting superficial transformations. No, we delve into the Necronomicon of the soul, engaging with powers that insist on absolute authenticity and unbridled truth, even when such revelations quake the very foundations of our being. This square, my fellow seekers, is a veritable Initiation unto itself, a rite of passage where the comfort of illusion is sacrificed upon the altar of Truth. Pluto, the great Lord of the Underworld in Scorpio, does not entertain the faint of heart. Its waters run as deep as they are dark, beckoning us to surrender the ego's façade in exchange for the soul's luminescence. Consider then, the alchemy at work here—an emotional alchemy, where the leaden heaviness of our deepest fears, insecurities, and wounds are subjected to the transformative fires of Pluto's realm. What emerges from this fiery ordeal is not merely survival, but a rebirth of the self, a phoenix risen not from ashes, but from the very essence of truth and illumination. In this powerful square, relationships serve as the mirrors of our deepest, most hidden chambers. They are not the sweet dalliances of surface affection but profound engagements that compel us to confront what we have buried in our subconscious crypts. Through the tempestuous dance with another, we are offered the chalice of self-awareness, a potion most potent in its capacity to transmute. Ambition, under this celestial influence, morphs into a magickal striving - not for the transient crowns of material dominion but for the laurels of spiritual sovereignty. It is a convocation to conquer not territories, but the shadowy realms within our own psyche, to emerge not merely unscathed but exalted, sanctified by the trials of our inner underworld. This aspect, dear practitioners of the arcane, calls for nothing less than the embrace of the Great Mystery - the cycle of death and rebirth, inherent in the pulse of existence itself. To be reborn, one must first consent to die - to the illusions, to the fears, to the chains that bind the spirit. In this sacred death, this surrender to the alchemical process, we find the true elixir of life - the ultimate magick of transformation. Thus, let us approach this square not as mere mortals facing the whims of fate, but as magicians, as alchemists, as seekers of the deeper mysteries, ready to undergo the profound metamorphosis that this celestial alignment portends. In doing so, we align ourselves with the most sublime of hermetic truths - that in the confrontation and integration of our deepest shadows lies the path to our most luminous light."},{"instruction":"elaborate and expand","output":"Venture forth, intrepid seekers of the hidden wisdom, into the profound and transformative alchemy presented by the square between the Moon in Capricorn and Pluto in Scorpio.

Originating from the Latin \\"illuminatus,\\" meaning enlightened, this term has historically been associated with various groups, both real and fictitious, that are often enveloped in myth, speculation, and intrigue. **Historical Context:** - The Bavarian Illuminati: Perhaps the most well-known, this Enlightenment-era secret society was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a professor of law. Its initial aim was to promote ideas of enlightenment, freedom of thought, and the separation of church and state, challenging the rigid structures of power at the time. However, due to political pressure and backlash, it was disbanded by the end of the 18th century. **Modern Mythos:** - In contemporary times, the term \\"Illuminati\\" has evolved to represent the concept of an all-encompassing, covert organization alleged to control world affairs, manipulating governments, economies, and societies to achieve global dominance. **Insight and Perspective:** 1. **Power and Secrecy**: The allure of the Illuminati lies in the human fascination with secret knowledge and power. Secret societies, throughout history, have thrived on the very idea of hidden wisdom and influence, captivating the imagination and inspiring countless stories, theories, and speculations. 2. **Symbolism and Influence**: Symbols attributed to such groups, like the all-seeing eye, have permeated popular culture, often taken as evidence of their insidious influence. Yet, these symbols often carry meanings deeply rooted in historical, spiritual, and philosophical contexts, far beyond their purported connections. 3. **Critical Thought and Inquiry**: In navigating the complex narratives surrounding the Illuminati, the discerning explorer is reminded of the importance of critical thought. Distinguishing between fact and fiction, historical evidence and speculative theory, encourages a deeper understanding of the forces that shape our world. **Embarking on the Path of Enlightenment:** Rather than looking outward for the keepers of secret knowledge, perhaps the true journey of enlightenment invites us to look within.

There is a powerful drive to assert one’s identity and to be recognized for one’s true self and achievements. **Potential Challenges:** - **Ego Conflicts:** The strong presence of the Sun can sometimes lead to ego conflicts with others, especially if the need for recognition overshadows collaboration and empathy. - **Impulsivity:** A propensity to act impulsively or to prioritize one's own needs and desires, sometimes at the expense of others' considerations. **Therapeutic Insights:** - Balancing assertiveness with sensitivity to others can enhance interpersonal relationships and reduce conflicts. - Channeling the Sun’s energy towards creative, entrepreneurial, or leadership endeavors can fulfill the need for visibility and recognition in constructive ways. - Reflection and mindfulness practices can help in managing impulsivity, fostering a deeper understanding of the motivations driving one's actions. **Diagnostic Suggestions:** - **Engage in Leadership:** Explore roles or projects where leadership skills can shine and benefit others. - **Creative Expression:** Pursue artistic or creative outlets that allow for personal expression and visibility. - **Self-Reflection:** Regular self-reflection can aid in understanding the self beyond the ego, deepening self-awareness, and fostering personal growth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **End of Diagnostic for Sun in the 1st House.** Would you like to explore diagnostics for other placements or require guidance on harmonizing these energies within your chart?"},{"instruction":"La gouvernance et la corruption","output":"sont deux concepts étroitement liés. La gouvernance se réfère à la manière dont un pays est dirigé et la manière dont les décisions sont prises au sein de ses institutions. Une bonne gouvernance repose sur des principes tels que la transparence, la responsabilité, la participation citoyenne et l'efficacité. La corruption, quant à elle, consiste en l'abus de pouvoir à des fins personnelles ou d'intérêt privé. Elle peut prendre diverses formes, telles que la fraude, le détournement de fonds, le favoritisme, le népotisme, etc. La corruption mine la gouvernance en sapant la confiance des citoyens dans leurs dirigeants et en compromettant l'équité et l'intégrité des processus décisionnels. Il est donc essentiel de lutter contre la corruption pour assurer une gouvernance saine et démocratique. Cela passe notamment par la mise en place de mécanismes de surveillance et de contrôle, la promotion de la transparence et de la responsabilité, ainsi que la sensibilisation et l'éducation des citoyens. En fin de compte, une gouvernance efficace et intègre est essentielle pour assurer le bien-être et le développement durable d'un pays."},{"instruction":"L'accès à l'éducation et à la santé","output":"sont des éléments cruciaux pour le développement socio-économique d'un pays. L'accès à une éducation de qualité permet à chaque individu de se former, de développer ses compétences et de s'épanouir pleinement. Cela contribue à réduire les inégalités, à favoriser l'insertion professionnelle et à renforcer la cohésion sociale. De même, l'accès à des services de santé de qualité est essentiel pour garantir le bien-être et la santé de la population. Cela permet de prévenir les maladies, de traiter les affections médicales et d'améliorer la qualité de vie des individus. De plus, des systèmes de santé efficaces sont indispensables pour faire face aux crises sanitaires et pour assurer une couverture universelle des soins de santé. Cependant, malgré leur importance, l'accès à l'éducation et à la santé reste inégal dans de nombreux pays en raison de divers facteurs tels que les inégalités socio-économiques, les barrières financières, les discriminations et les infrastructures insuffisantes. Il est donc essentiel pour les gouvernements et les acteurs concernés de mettre en place des politiques et des initiatives visant à garantir un accès équitable à ces services essentiels pour tous les citoyens. Cela contribuera non seulement à améliorer la qualité de vie des individus, mais aussi à favoriser le développement durable et l'inclusion sociale."},{"instruction":"Qu'est ce que l'urbanisation rapide","output":"L'urbanisation rapide est un phénomène caractérisé par une croissance rapide et importante de la population urbaine dans les villes et les zones urbaines. Ce processus est généralement associé à la migration des populations rurales vers les zones urbaines à la recherche de meilleures opportunités économiques, d'emplois et de meilleurs services. L'urbanisation rapide entraîne souvent une expansion rapide des villes, une augmentation de la densité de population, une transformation rapide des paysages urbains et une pression croissante sur les infrastructures existantes (logements, transports, services publics, etc.). Cela peut également entraîner des défis tels que la surpopulation, la congestion, la pauvreté urbaine, la pollution, la dégradation de l'environnement, les inégalités sociales, etc. Pour faire face à l'urbanisation rapide, il est essentiel de mettre en place des politiques urbaines efficaces et durables qui favorisent un développement urbain équilibré, inclusif et durable. Cela implique la planification urbaine, la construction de logements abordables, l'amélioration des infrastructures de transport et de services publics, la protection de l'environnement, la promotion de l'emploi et de l'entrepreneuriat urbain, ainsi que la participation citoyenne dans la gestion des villes. En adoptant une approche holistique et intégrée de l'urbanisation, il est possible de transformer les défis liés à la croissance urbaine rapide en opportunités de développement durable et de prospérité pour les populations urbaines."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"ateizmin ilkeleri","output":"Ateizm, genellikle bir veya daha fazla tanrının varlığını reddetme veya inançsızlık olarak tanımlanır. Ateizm, monoteistik, politeistik ve diğer türdeki dinlere yönelik bir reddiye ya da alternatif bir bakış açısı olarak kabul edilebilir. Ateizm birçok farklı form ve çeşitlilikte olabilir, ancak bazı temel ilkeler genellikle bu düşünce sistemini tanımlar: 1. **Tanrı'nın Varoluşuna İnançsızlık**: Ateizmin temel ilkesi, herhangi bir tanrı veya tanrılara inançsızlıktır. Bu, bireyin tanrı veya tanrıların var olduğuna dair somut, empirik kanıt olmadığını ve bu nedenle böyle bir varoluşun kabul edilemez olduğunu savunduğu anlamına gelir. 2. **Skeptisizm**: Birçok ateist, doğaüstü iddialara ve metafiziksel konseptlere karşı derin bir şüphecilik sergiler. Onlar, gerçeklerin ve bilginin akıl yoluyla ve bilimsel araştırma yoluyla keşfedilebileceğine inanır. 3. **Doğaüstünün Reddi**: Ateizm genellikle doğaüstü olayların, varlıkların veya güçlerin varlığını reddeder. Bunun yerine, fenomenlerin doğal nedenlerle ve yasalarla açıklanabileceğine inanılır. 4. **Bilimsel Yönteme Bağlılık**: Ateist görüş, genellikle bilimsel yöntemi gerçeklik hakkında bilgi edinmenin en güvenilir yolu olarak kabul eder. Bu, gözlem, deney, ve mantıksal çıkarımı içerir. 5. **Ahlakın Dini Olmayan Temelleri**: Ateistler, ahlaki değerlerin ve davranış kurallarının tanrısal bir otorite veya kutsal kitaplardan gelmek zorunda olmadığını savunur. Ahlakın insan toplumlarının ihtiyaçlarından, insan haklarından, bireysel özgürlüklerden ve karşılıklı saygıdan kaynaklandığına inanılır. 6. **Bağımsız Düşünce ve Özgürlük**: Ateizm, bireyin düşünce ve inanç özgürlüğüne büyük önem verir. Bu, bireyin otoriteye körü körüne itaat etmek yerine, özgürce düşünmesi, sorgulaması ve kendi sonuçlarına varması gerektiği anlamına gelir. 7. **Yaşamın Dünyevi Değerinin Vurgulanması**: Ateizm genellikle ölümden sonra bir yaşamın var olmadığını ve bu nedenle mevcut hayatın kendisinin en yüksek değere sahip olduğunu vurgular. Bu, insanların yaşamı burada ve şimdi anlamlandırmaları ve değerlendirmeleri gerektiği anlamına gelir. Bu ilkeler ateizmin genel bir anlayışını sunsa da, ateizmin içinde çeşitlilik büyüktür ve farklı ateistler farklı felsefeleri ve inançları benimseyebilir. Bu nedenle, ateizmin birçok farklı yorumu ve pratiği mevcuttur."},{"instruction":"agnostisizmin ilkeleri","output":"Agnostisizm, genellikle tanrının varlığı veya evrenin temel doğası gibi metafiziksel iddiaların bilinemez olduğu görüşünü benimser. Bu düşünce yapısı, mutlak bir inanç veya inkâr yerine, belli konularda kesin bir bilgiye ulaşılamayacağına dair bir pozisyon alır. Agnostisizmin temel ilkeleri şunları içerir: 1. **Bilginin Sınırlılığı**: Agnostisizm, insan bilgisinin sınırlı olduğunu kabul eder ve bazı soruların, özellikle tanrı, ölümden sonra hayat veya evrenin ultimatif doğası gibi konuların, insan aklı veya bilimsel araştırma ile tam olarak anlaşılamayacağını savunur. 2. **Felsefi Şüphecilik**: Agnostisizm genellikle felsefi şüpheciliği benimser ve her türlü metafiziksel ya da dini iddiaya karşı temkinli yaklaşır. Buna göre, bu tür iddiaların doğru veya yanlış olup olmadığını kesin bir şekilde belirlemek mümkün değildir. 3. **Dini Dogmanın Reddi**: Agnostikler, dini dogmaları ve kesinlik iddialarını sıklıkla reddederler. Onlar için belli bir dinin ya da inancın mutlak gerçekliği temsil ettiği fikri kabul edilemezdir, çünkü bu tür iddiaların bilimsel veya mantıksal olarak doğrulanamayacağına inanılır. 4. **Açık Fikirlilik**: Agnostisizm, belirsizlikle rahat olmayı ve farklı görüşlere açık kalmayı gerektirir. Agnostikler, bir konuda kesin bir bilgiye sahip olunmadığında, farklı olasılıkları ve perspektifleri değerlendirmeye açık olma eğilimindedirler. 5. **Bireysel Araştırma ve Sorgulama**: Agnostisizm, bireyleri kendi bilgilerini sorgulamaya ve kendi sonuçlarına varmaya teşvik eder. Bu, kişisel inançların, bilimsel kanıtlar ve mantıksal sorgulama yoluyla sürekli olarak değerlendirilmesini önerir. 6. **Ahlakın Dinsel Olmayan Temelleri**: Birçok agnostik gibi, ateistler de ahlaki değerlerin ve davranış kurallarının dini inançlardan bağımsız olarak oluşturulabileceğine inanır. Ahlakın insan deneyiminden, empatiden ve toplumsal ihtiyaçlardan türetilebileceği görüşündedirler. 7. **Empirizme ve Rasyonalizme Bağlılık**: Agnostisizm, bilgiye ulaşmanın yolları olarak empirizm ve rasyonalizmi önemser. Ancak, bu yaklaşımların her türlü soruya cevap verebileceği varsayımını da sorgular. Agnostisizmin temelinde yatan, kesinlik arayışı yerine, gerçeğin karmaşık, çok katmanlı ve belki de tam olarak kavranamaz olduğuna dair bir kabuldür. Bu düşünce yapısı, bireyleri sürekli araştırma ve sorgulama sürecine davet eder ve mutlak doğruların peşinde koşmak yerine, belirsizliklerle barışık olmayı öğütler."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Art of Serenity | Book, Coffee, and Flower Themed Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts, and More.

No entanto, no uso comum, especialmente na internet e em contextos de produtos, filmes, livros, jogos, entre outros, \\"review\\" significa uma avaliação ou crítica sobre algo. Quando eu faço um \\"review\\", eu estou compartilhando minha opinião e experiência sobre um produto ou serviço. Eu posso falar sobre o que gostei, o que não gostei, se recomendo ou não, e por quê. Agora, falando sobre a diferença entre \\"review\\" e análise, eu diria que está principalmente na profundidade e no foco. Uma análise é mais profunda e técnica do que um \\"review\\". Quando alguém faz uma análise, essa pessoa vai além de apenas compartilhar suas opiniões pessoais. Ela examina detalhes técnicos, explora os contextos, faz comparações com produtos, obras ou serviços similares, e pode até incluir pesquisa sobre o assunto. A análise busca entender e explicar por que algo é do jeito que é, quais são seus méritos e defeitos, de uma maneira mais objetiva e detalhada. Por exemplo, se eu estiver fazendo um \\"review\\" de um filme, eu posso falar sobre se gostei ou não do filme, quais atores atuaram bem, se a história me emocionou, e assim por diante. Mas, se eu estiver fazendo uma análise desse mesmo filme, eu vou mais fundo. Eu posso discutir sobre como o filme se encaixa no gênero, quais técnicas cinematográficas o diretor usou, como a trilha sonora contribui para a narrativa, entre outros aspectos mais técnicos e detalhados. Então, resumindo, a principal diferença entre \\"review\\" e análise é que o \\"review\\" é mais sobre compartilhar opiniões pessoais e experiências, enquanto a análise é mais detalhada, técnica e objetiva. Eu espero que isso ajude a esclarecer as coisas!"},{"instruction":"import sympy as sp from sympy import cos, sin from numpy import e import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sympy.abc import t from IPython.display import * sp.init_printing(use_latex=True) class ElementVibrant: def __init__(self, masse, raideur, amortissement, fonction): globals()['F0'] = sp.symbols('F0') globals()['w'] = sp.symbols('w') globals()['t'] = sp.symbols('t') globals()['a'] = sp.symbols('a') self.masse = masse self.raideur = raideur self.amortissement = amortissement self.fonction = fonction def Afficher(self): print(\\"Description du système:\\") print(f\\" - Masse: {self.masse} kg\\") print(f\\" - Raideur: {self.raideur} N/m\\") print(f\\" - Amortissement: {self.amortissement} Ns/m\\") print(f\\" - Fréquence naturelle: {self.calculer_frequence_naturelle()} Hz\\") def Equation(self, type=\\"H\\"): x = sp.Function('x') eq = self.masse*sp.Derivative(x(t), t, t) + self.amortissement*sp.Derivative(x(t), t) + self.raideur*x(t) if type == \\"H\\": print(\\"Équation homogène du mouvement:\\") #print(\\"m * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = 0\\") print(sp.Eq(eq, 0)) elif type == \\"G\\": print(\\"Équation générale du mouvement:\\") #print(\\"m * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = F(t)\\") print(sp.Eq(eq, self.fonction)) else: print(\\"Type d'équation non reconnu.

Your Keras model expects input data to be in the shape \`(None, 28, 28, 1)\`, but the data you are providing is in the shape \`(28, 28)\`. The expected shape suggests that the model is designed to take images with height and width both equal to 28 pixels and with a single channel (e.g., grayscale images), but your input lacks the channel dimension. To fix this issue, you need to reshape your input data to include the channel dimension. Here is how you can do it: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Assuming \`image\` is your input image with shape (28, 28) # You need to reshape it to (1, 28, 28, 1) before feeding it to the model image_reshaped = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # This adds the batch dimension: (1, 28, 28) image_reshaped = np.expand_dims(image_reshaped, axis=-1) # This adds the channel dimension: (1, 28, 28, 1) # Now you can provide this \`image_reshaped\` to your Keras model predictedVirtualId = np.argmax(self.keras.predict(image_reshaped), axis=1) # Continue with your processing... \`\`\` Here's a brief explanation of the changes: - \`np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)\` adds a new dimension at the beginning to account for the \\"batch size\\" expected by Keras models. Keras models expect inputs to be in batches, even if you're only predicting on one image at a time. - \`np.expand_dims(image_reshaped, axis=-1)\` further adds a new dimension at the end to represent the channels of the image. Since your model expects a single channel, this change makes the input shape compatible with the model's expectations. By reshaping the image correctly, you should be able to resolve the \`ValueError\` related to the invalid input shape."},{"instruction":"ValueError: Exception encountered when calling Conv2D.call().

Specifically, it reveals an incorrect input shape being used - \`(1, 784, 1, 1)\` in your case. A Conv2D layer expects input in the format \`(batch_size, height, width, channels)\`. Looking at the shape \`(1, 784, 1, 1)\`, it seems like the image data has been flattened or is not correctly reshaped to fit this expectation. This often occurs when working with datasets like MNIST, where each image is originally shaped as a flat 784-length vector (since 28x28=784) or when an image is not reshaped correctly before being passed into the model. Given that the error indicates an operation where a convolutional filter of size 3x3 is used (\`subtracting 3 from 1\`), and since the data format is mentioned as \\"NHWC\\" (which corresponds to \`(batch, height, width, channels)\`), the likely situation here is an incorrect reshape operation that does not align with the expected Conv2D input shape. The solution is to ensure that the input images are correctly reshaped to the format that the Conv2D layer expects. For a grayscale image from a dataset like MNIST, this would mean reshaping from \`(784,)\` or \`(28, 28)\` to \`(28, 28, 1)\` to include the channels dimension, assuming the images are grayscale and there's just one channel. If you're using a dataset where each image is represented as a 784-length vector (as is common with flattened MNIST datasets), you should reshape it back to 2D dimensions with a channel dimension: \`\`\`python # Assuming \`flattened_image\` is your input image with shape (784,) # Reshape it to (28, 28, 1) to fit the Conv2D layer's expectation reshaped_image = flattened_image.reshape((28, 28, 1)) \`\`\` You might need to adjust your data preprocessing step where you convert or load the image data to ensure this reshaping occurs before the images are fed into the model. In scenarios where you're directly dealing with preprocessed data (e.g., a dataset loader that gives you flattened images), this reshaping needs to be an integral part of your data pipeline before model ingestion."},{"instruction":"ciao","output":"Ciao!

Qui sotto trovi alcuni dei principali aspetti che caratterizzano il passaggio dalla versione 3.5 a GPT-4: 1. **Migliorata comprensione del contesto**: GPT-4 può gestire contesti più lunghi e complessi, permettendo una conversazione più fluida e accurata su argomenti complessi. 2. **Aumentata capacità di apprendere da esempi**: GPT-4 risponde meglio agli esempi forniti dagli utenti, consentendo una personalizzazione più efficace della risposta in base alle istruzioni date. 3. **Riduzione degli errori di fatto e logica**: Anche se non è esente da errori, GPT-4 tende a fare meno errori di comprensione e logici rispetto a GPT-3.5, migliorando l'affidabilità delle sue risposte. 4. **Migliore gestione delle domande ambigue o complesse**: GPT-4 è più capace di gestire domande ambigue o che richiedono elaborazioni complesse, offrendo risposte che tentano di bilanciare differenti interpretazioni o aspetti di una questione. 5. **Limiti**: Anche se migliorato, GPT-4 ha ancora dei limiti, inclusa la comprensione imperfetta del contesto in alcune circostanze e la presenza di bias nei dati su cui è stato addestrato. La lotta contro la disinformazione e i pregiudizi rimane una priorità. 6. **Applicazioni più ampie**: Con i suoi miglioramenti, GPT-4 trova applicazione in un ventaglio ancora più ampio di campi, dalla generazione assistita di codice alla creazione di contenuti, dall'apprendimento automatico alla consulenza. 7. **Interattività**: GPT-4 offre un'esperienza di conversazione ancora più ricca e interattiva, rendendo l'interazione con l'IA più naturale e piacevole. Nonostante questi miglioramenti, è importante ricordare che GPT-4, come i suoi predecessori, non è consapevole né capace di comprendere il mondo nel modo in cui lo fanno gli esseri umani.

**.cx**：原本是圣诞岛的国家代码顶级域名（ccTLD），但它并不局限于地理位置，可以被全球各种网站使用。如果你的目标受众是全球性的，并且不特别关注地理定位，.cx可能是一个合适的选择。 - **.cr**：是哥斯达黎加的国家代码顶级域名。如果你的业务或组织位于哥斯达黎加，或者你的主要客户群体来自该国，使用.cr可能更有利于地方化和在当地市场中建立信任。 2. **品牌识别度和行业关联**： - **.cx** 对于某些企业或项目可能具有特殊的含义，特别是与“客户体验”（Customer Experience，简称CX）或者“人工智能”（AI，其中X代表未知）相关的领域。 - **.cr** 在特定行业中可能没有明显的关联，但对于在哥斯达黎加有实际业务运营的企业来说，它能够增强地区相关性。 3. **可用性**： - 各自域名的可用性也是一个重要因素。由于某些TLD可能更受欢迎或使用更广泛，你想要的特定域名在一个TLD下可能已被注册而在另一个TLD下仍然可用。 4. **个人或品牌偏好**： - 最终的选择也可能取决于个人偏好或符合品牌形象的需求。有些品牌可能更倾向于选择一个独特的TLD，以区别于竞争对手和加强品牌形象。 总体而言，没有绝对的“更好”选项，最佳选择取决于你的具体需求和目标。考虑你的目标受众、品牌定位以及你想要传递的信息，然后根据这些因素做出决定。如果可能的话，注册多个相关域名并将它们重定向到主网站，这样可以保护你的品牌和提高网站的访问量。"},{"instruction":"我现在准备翻译一份数据科学家的简历，翻译成中文，请注意一些数据科学以及互联网企业的专业用语的翻译，格式也按照原有的格式，下面的英文是关于自我介绍的，请开始你的翻译• Data savvy with 7+ years hands-on analytical experience across finance, marketing, and mobile gaming/apps with strong communication skills as well as proficiency in data analytics, a/b testing, causal inference, ML, and predictive modeling, seeks a position as a Staff/Sr. DS. • Formerly a consecutive interpreter (CHN-ENG), now a data-driven strategist and advocate adept at transforming business challenges into precise quantitative inquiries and translating statistical outcomes into actionable business strategies.","output":"熟悉数据，拥有7年以上实际的分析经验，跨越金融、营销及移动游戏/应用领域，具备强大的沟通能力及数据分析、A/B测试、因果推断、机器学习和预测建模的专业技能，寻求担任高级/资深数据科学家职位。 曾为连续口译员（中英互译），现为以数据为驱动的策略家和倡导者，擅长将商业挑战转化为精准的量化问题，并将统计结果转化为可执行的商业策略。"},{"instruction":"翻译的一般，有点过于直译，考虑中文的阅读习惯和语言习惯，以及互联网以及数据科学的专业用语，在进行一次翻译","output":"具有逾7年在金融、营销、移动游戏/应用领域中实战分析经验的数据专家，拥有出色的沟通能力和精通数据分析、A/B测试、因果推理、机器学习以及预测模型构建，寻求高级/资深数据科学家职位。 前连续口译（中英）专家，现转型为数据驱动决策的战略家和拥护者，擅长将商业难题转换为定量研究问题，并将统计分析结果转译为可行的商业战略。"},{"instruction":"现在在我的自我介绍中补充一些我过往的经历，请对其进行翻译，里面会涉及较多的数据科学术语以及互联网及游戏行业的专业词汇，请务必注重考量翻译的信达雅～At Tencent, Lin led a team of talented Data Scientists and Analysts in product analytics, experimentation, metrics, ML/DL, and causal inference work across domains.

We used layered causal inference for specific interventions to identify an optimal growth rate for players in different states, which continuously changes as player states evolve and the season progresses.

While e-marketing offers many benefits, it also has some limitations. Some of the key limitations of e-marketing include: 1. Limited reach: Not all target audiences may be reached through online channels, particularly if they are not active online or do not use digital devices. 2. Information overload: With the abundance of online content, consumers may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and advertising messages they are exposed to, making it challenging for brands to capture their attention. 3. Privacy concerns: E-marketing often involves collecting and using customer data for targeting and personalization, which can raise privacy concerns among consumers and lead to distrust of brands. 4. Technical limitations: Not all consumers have access to high-speed internet or the latest devices, which can impact their ability to engage with e-marketing campaigns that require advanced technology. 5. Ad blocking: Many internet users utilize ad-blocking software to prevent display ads from appearing on websites, reducing the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns. 6. Competition: The online marketplace is highly competitive, with many businesses vying for consumers' attention and spending, making it challenging for brands to stand out and attract customers. 7. Lack of personalization: While e-marketing allows for some degree of personalization through data-driven targeting, it can sometimes feel impersonal compared to in-person interactions or traditional marketing methods. 8. Security issues: E-marketing activities such as email marketing and online transactions can be vulnerable to security breaches and cyberattacks, putting both consumers and businesses at risk of fraud or data theft.

Потеря веса может происходить по нескольким причинам: 1. **Нарушение аппетита**: Паразитарные инфекции могут вызывать дискомфорт или боли в животе, что может отразиться на аппетите и способствовать снижению потребления пищи. 2. **Плохое усвоение питательных веществ**: Острицы могут повлиять на способность кишечника адекватно усваивать питательные вещества из пищи, что может приводить к потере веса. 3. **Стресс и беспокойство**: Симптомы, связанные с энтеробиозом, такие как зуд в анальной области, могут вызывать стресс и беспокойство, что также потенциально может повлиять на вес. Однако стоит заметить, что существенная и заметная потеря веса чаще всего связана с другими причинами и заболеваниями. Если вы замечаете у себя необъяснимую потерю веса, особенно если это сопровождается другими симптомами, важно как можно скорее обратиться к врачу для уточнения диагноза и получения соответствующего лечения. Лечение энтеробиоза подразумевает прием антигельминтных препаратов, назначаемых по рекомендации врача, а также соблюдение мер гигиены для предотвращения повторного заражения и заражения окружающих."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dies zeigt an, dass der Watcher korrekt funktioniert. - Stelle sicher, dass die Nachricht (\`message.value\`) korrekt mit dem neu zugewiesenen Wert aktualisiert wird und dass die \`post\`-Funktion aufgerufen wird, um die Nachricht zu senden. 3. **Empfangsvorgang überprüfen:** - Im zweiten Fenster, dem Empfänger, solltest du in der Konsole eine Ausgabe sehen, die der empfangenen Nachricht entspricht, sobald die Nachricht gesendet wird. Die Ausgabe wird durch den \`onMessage\`-Callback in der \`useBroadcastChannel\`-Komponente getriggert und sollte in etwa so aussehen: “Nachricht empfangen: heloooo”. 4. **Fehlersuche:** - Sollten die Nachrichten nicht wie erwartet empfangen werden, überprüfe, ob beide Fenster/Tabs den exakt gleichen Kanalnamen verwenden (in diesem Fall ‘vueuse-demo-channel’). Groß- und Kleinschreibung beachten! - Stelle sicher, dass du keine Fehler in den Import-Statements hast und dass \`@vueuse/core\` korrekt in deinem Projekt installiert und konfiguriert ist. - Überprüfe, ob dein Browser die Broadcast Channel API unterstützt. Während die meisten modernen Browser dies tun, gibt es Ausnahmen, insbesondere bei Mobilbrowsern oder älteren Browser-Versionen. 5. **Weitere Überprüfungen:** - Wenn du mit Vue.js arbeitest, ist es manchmal hilfreich, das Vue Devtools-Plugin zu nutzen, um den Zustand der Refs (\`message\`, \`config.settings\`) live zu überwachen. Durch das sorgfältige Verfolgen dieser Überprüfungsschritte kannst du sicherstellen, dass deine Nachrichten-Übertragung wie erwartet funktioniert und bei Bedarf Fehler identifizieren und beheben."},{"instruction":"Auf der Console von Fenster 1 steht \\"config.settings ref changed, broadcasting!\\" Auf der Console von Fenster 2 kommt nichts","output":"Wenn im ersten Fenster die Nachricht, dass die Einstellungen geändert wurden und die Nachricht gesendet wurde, korrekt erscheint, im zweiten Fenster jedoch keine empfangene Nachricht ankommt, gibt es mehrere potenzielle Problembereiche, die untersucht werden sollten: # 1. Überprüfe die Namen der Broadcast-Kanäle Stelle sicher, dass der Kanalname in beiden Fenstern exakt übereinstimmt. Auch kleinste Unterschiede, wie zusätzliche Leerzeichen oder Groß- und Kleinschreibung, können dazu führen, dass die Kanäle als unterschiedlich betrachtet werden. # 2. Browser-Unterstützung und Einschränkungen - **Unterstützung:** Nicht alle Browser unterstützen die Broadcast Channel API. Überprüfe die Kompatibilität deines Browsers mit dieser API. Moderne Browser wie Firefox, Chrome und Edge sollten damit keine Probleme haben, aber bei älteren Versionen oder bestimmten mobilen Browsern kann es Einschränkungen geben. - **Einschränkungen bei privaten/incognito Fenstern:** Einige Browser erlauben nicht die Kommunikation zwischen privaten und nicht-privaten Fenstern. Versichere dich, dass beide Fenster im gleichen Modus laufen (entweder beide im Normalmodus oder beide im Incognito-/Privatmodus). # 3. Überprüfung der Vue-Komposition-API Nutzung Stelle sicher, dass dein Code korrekt ausgeführt wird. - Hast du eventuell die Verarbeitung der empfangenen Nachricht nicht korrekt implementiert oder gibt es Fehler im Code, die das korrekte Ausführen verhindern? - Fehlt möglicherweise ein wichtiger Lifecycle-Hook oder ist ein Fehler im Setup der Vue-Instanz? # 4. Netzwerk und Sicherheitseinschränkungen In seltenen Fällen können Netzwerkeinstellungen oder Sicherheitssoftwares (z.B. Firewalls) die Funktion der Broadcast Channel API beeinträchtigen. Dies ist weniger wahrscheinlich, sollte aber in Betracht gezogen werden, wenn alle anderen Schritte fehlschlagen. # 5. Experimentelles Feature In einigen Fällen, besonders in älteren Browsern, könnte es sein, dass die Broadcast Channel API als experimentelles Feature gekennzeichnet ist und erst aktiviert werden muss. Überprüfe die Einstellungen deines Browsers auf solche Optionen. # Fehlerbehebung: - Verwende Konsolenausgaben (Debugging) in deiner \`onMessage\` Funktion, um zu bestätigen, dass die Funktion aufgerufen wird. In manchen Fällen wird die Funktion aufgerufen, aber ein Fehler innerhalb der Funktion verhindert die Ausgabe oder Weiterverarbeitung der empfangenen Nachricht. - Führe einen simplen Test mit statischem Text statt variabler Daten durch, um zu bestätigen, dass die grundlegende Funktionalität der Broadcast Channel API funktioniert. - Nutze Browser-Entwicklertools, um das Netzwerk und JavaScript-Ausführung zu überwachen, wodurch du möglicherweise aufschlussreiche Fehlermeldungen findest. Wenn du all diese Punkte überprüft hast und das Problem immer noch besteht, könnte ein genauerer Blick auf die spezifische Implementierung oder sogar isolierte Tests mit einem minimalen Setup notwendig sein, um das Problem einzugrenzen."},{"instruction":"Wie werden broadcasts im browser denn technisch übermittelt? Kann ich da etwas auf der Browser console debuggen wie etwa xhr oder websocket nachrichten?","output":"Die Broadcast Channel API, mit der Nachrichten zwischen verschiedenen Browser-Tabs, Fenstern oder sogar Web Workers übermittelt werden können, nutzt keinen der herkömmlichen Netzwerkprotokolle wie XMLHttpRequest (XHR) oder WebSockets, die für die Kommunikation mit einem Server verwendet werden. Stattdessen handelt es sich um eine Browser-integrierte API, die es ermöglicht, einfach Nachrichten innerhalb desselben Ursprungs (Origin) zu senden und zu empfangen, ohne dass Nachrichten das Gerät verlassen oder durch einen Server vermittelt werden. Das bedeutet, dass sie nicht als Netzwerkanfragen erscheinen, die du zum Beispiel im \\"Network\\"-Reiter der Entwicklertools deines Browsers sehen würdest. # Technische Umsetzung Technisch gesehen funktioniert dies durch einen internen Mechanismus des Browsers, der separate Kontexte (wie Tabs oder Fenster) desselben Ursprungs miteinander kommunizieren lässt. Jede Nachricht, die über einen Broadcast Channel gesendet wird, wird vom Browser direkt an alle anderen Listening Contexts (die denselben Channel abonniert haben) innerhalb desselben Ursprungs übermittelt. # Debugging von Broadcast Channel Nachrichten Da Broadcast-Nachrichten nicht über das Netzwerk gesendet werden, werden sie nicht im \\"Network\\"-Tab angezeigt. Allerdings kannst du sie mit Konsole-Log-Meldungen debuggen, indem du \`console.log\`-Aufrufe sowohl ins \\"onMessage\\"-Event (für den Empfang von Nachrichten) als auch direkt vor oder nach dem Senden einer Nachricht über den Channel einfügst. Hier sind ein paar Debugging-Ideen: 1. **Loggen des Versendens einer Nachricht:** Beim Senden einer Nachricht über den Channel kannst du etwas wie folgt tun: \`\`\`javascript console.log('Senden der Nachricht über den Broadcast Channel', message); post(message); \`\`\` 2. **Loggen des Empfangs einer Nachricht:** Für den Empfang kannst du innerhalb der \`onMessage\`-Callbackfunktion loggen: \`\`\`javascript const { onMessage } = useBroadcastChannel({ name: 'vueuse-demo-channel', onMessage: (event) => { console.log('Nachricht empfangen:', event.data); } }); \`\`\` 3. **Überwachen der aktiven Channels:** Es gibt keine native Browser-Funktionalität, die dir erlaubt, eine Liste der aktiven Broadcast Channels direkt einzusehen. Das Tracking muss in deinem Code durch das Führen von Logs oder durch Implementierung eines Zustandsmanagements passieren, das offenlegt, wann und wie Channels eröffnet oder geschlossen werden. 4. **Testen des Verhaltens bei verschiedenen Zuständen:** Um verschiedene Szenarien wie Verbindungsabbrüche oder das Schließen eines Tabs zu simulieren und zu sehen, wie sich deine Anwendung verhält, kannst du manuell Tabs schließen oder die Broadcast Channel Instanz deaktivieren und die Reaktion überwachen. # Fazit Für das Debugging von Broadcast Channels solltest du dich also auf die JavaScript-Konsole und die dortigen Log-Meldungen verlassen, um den Fluss und Inhalt deiner Nachrichten zu verfolgen, anstatt auf die Netzwerk-Kommunikationstools des Browsers."},{"instruction":"der broadcast über zwei verschiedene browser würde nur über einen server gehen?","output":"Ja, genau. Der Broadcast Channel API in Web-Browsern ist speziell darauf ausgelegt, Daten zwischen verschiedenen Tabs oder Fenstern desselben Browsers und desselben Ursprungs (Origin) zu übermitteln. Wenn du eine Nachrichtenübermittlung zwischen zwei verschiedenen Browsern, eventuell sogar auf unterschiedlichen Geräten, einrichten möchtest, wäre dies nicht direkt über die Broadcast Channel API möglich. In solchen Fällen wird eine serverseitige oder Cloud-basierte Vermittlung benötigt. Für eine solche Funktionalität könntest du eine der folgenden Technologien oder Ansätze in Erwägung ziehen: # Websockets WebSockets bieten eine bidirektionale, voll-duplex Kommunikation über eine einzige, langanhaltende Verbindung zwischen dem Client (Browser) und dem Server. Du könntest einen WebSocket-Server einrichten, der als zentraler Kommunikationspunkt für die verschiedenen Browser-Clients fungiert. Jeder Browser würde eine WebSocket-Verbindung zum Server aufbauen, und der Server würde Nachrichten entgegennehmen und sie an alle anderen verbundenen Clients weiterleiten (oder an spezifische Clients, je nach deinem Anwendungsfall). # Server-Sent Events (SSE) Server-Sent Events ermöglichen es dem Server, automatisch Daten an den Client zu senden, sobald neue Daten verfügbar sind. Wie bei WebSockets wäre auch hier ein Server erforderlich, der die Verbindung zu den Clients verwaltet. Im Gegensatz zu WebSockets sind SSE-Verbindungen jedoch unidirektional vom Server zum Client. # Polling oder Long Polling Eine einfachere, wenn auch weniger effiziente Methode, ist das regelmäßige Abfragen (Polling) des Servers durch den Client, um zu überprüfen, ob neue Daten vorliegen. Bei Long Polling bleibt die Anfrage offen, bis neue Daten verfügbar sind oder ein Timeout eintritt; danach wird sofort eine neue Anfrage gestellt. # Cloud-basierte Echtzeit-Datenbanken oder Pub/Sub-Dienste Dienste wie Firebase Realtime Database oder Google Cloud Pub/Sub bieten Echtzeit-Datenübertragung zwischen Client-Anwendungen mit relativ geringem Einrichtungsaufwand. Diese Dienste verwalten die Netzwerkverbindungen, Datensicherheit und -verteilung für dich, was besonders nützlich sein kann, wenn du keine eigene Infrastruktur einrichten möchtest. Um eine solche Funktionalität zu implementieren, müsstest du sowohl Client- als auch Server-seitigen Code schreiben, der die Logik für das Weiterleiten der Nachrichten an alle verbundenen Clients (oder einen ausgewählten Satz von Clients) sowie das Handhaben von Verbindungen und möglichen Fehlern umfasst."},{"instruction":"wie könnte ein einfacher Websockets server in php aussehen der alle empfangen nachrichten wieder zurück sendet an eine js app. Also js app in fenster 1 sendet hallo js app in fenster 2 empfängt hallo","output":"Um einen einfachen WebSocket-Server in PHP zu erstellen, der empfangene Nachrichten an alle verbundenen Client-Applikationen zurücksendet (inklusive eines JavaScript-Clients), kannst du die Ratchet-Bibliothek verwenden.

PHP unterstützt Sockets über die Sockets Extension, die es Ihnen ermöglicht, Sockets zu öffnen, zu lesen, zu schreiben und zu schließen. Dadurch können Sie einen grundlegenden Websocket-Server ohne externe Bibliotheken oder Frameworks erstellen. Ein einfacher Websocket-Server durchläuft in der Regel folgende Schritte: 1. **Socket erstellen:** Sie erstellen einen Socket, der auf eine spezifische IP-Adresse und einen Port hört. 2. **Socket binden:** Der Socket wird an eine IP-Adresse und einen Port gebunden, sodass Anfragen, die an diese Adresse und diesen Port gesendet werden, vom Socket empfangen werden. 3. **Auf Verbindungen hören:** Der Server beginnt, auf eingehende Verbindungen zu hören, und akzeptiert sie. 4. **Websocket-Handshake:** Für jede neue Verbindung führt der Server den Websocket-Handshake-Prozess durch, um aus einer gewöhnlichen HTTP-Verbindung eine Websocket-Verbindung zu machen. 5. **Kommunikation:** Nach erfolgreichem Handshake können Daten zwischen dem Client und dem Server in Echtzeit über den Websocket ausgetauscht werden. 6. **Verbindung schließen:** Entweder der Client oder der Server kann die Verbindung schließen, wenn die Kommunikation beendet ist. Hier ist ein sehr einfaches Beispiel für einen Websocket-Server in PHP, der zeigt, wie man mit dem Handshake umgeht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass dieses Beispiel sehr grundlegend ist und für die Produktion angepasst und erweitert werden sollte: \`\`\`php <?php host = 'localhost'; port = 8080; null = NULL; // Erstelle TCP/IP-Socket socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); // Wiederverwendung des Ports erlauben socket_set_option(socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1); // Socket an Port binden socket_bind(socket, 0, port); // Auf Verbindungen hören socket_listen(socket); // Array von Clients clients = array(socket); while (true) { changed = clients; // Überwache Sockets auf Veränderungen socket_select(changed, null, null, 0, 10); // Wenn ein neuer Client eine Verbindung herstellt if (in_array(socket, changed)) { socket_new = socket_accept(socket); // Akzeptiere neue Socket-Verbindung clients[] = socket_new; // Füge die Socket-Verbindung zur Client-Liste hinzu header = socket_read(socket_new, 1024); // Lese die Daten, die der Client gesendet hat perform_websocket_handshake(header, socket_new, host, port); // Führe den WebSocket-Handshake durch // Finde den Socket in der geänderten Liste und entferne ihn found_socket = array_search(socket, changed); unset(changed[found_socket]); } // jetzt mit allen Clients kommunizieren, die Daten gesendet haben foreach (changed as changed_socket) { // Überprüfe, ob der Client disconnected ist while(socket_recv(changed_socket, buf, 1024, 0) >= 1) { // Verarbeite hier die empfangenen Daten // Beispiel: sende die Nachricht an alle verbundenen Clients außer dem Sender break 2; // Beende die Überprüfung dieses Sockets und fahre mit dem nächsten fort } // Überprüfen, ob die socket_recv Schleife wegen einer beendeten Verbindung verlassen wurde found_socket = array_search(changed_socket, clients); socket_getpeername(changed_socket, ip); unset(clients[found_socket]); // Schließe die Verbindung socket_close(changed_socket); } } // Schließe den listening Socket socket_close(socket); function perform_websocket_handshake(receved_header, client_conn, host, port) { headers = array(); lines = preg_split(\\"/rn/\\", receved_header); foreach (lines as line) { line = rtrim(line); if (preg_match('/A(S+): (.*)z/', line, matches)) { headers[matches[1]] = matches[2]; } } secKey = headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key']; secAccept = base64_encode(pack('H*', sha1(secKey .

Electrolytes are essential minerals — like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium — that are crucial for many bodily functions, including hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function. Here's a simple, delicious recipe you can adjust to your taste and needs: # Homemade Delicious Electrolyte Drink Recipe Ingredients: - 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice - 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice - 1-2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup (adjust according to your preference for sweetness) - 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt (rich in minerals and electrolytes) - 2 cups of cold water or coconut water (for added potassium and a tropical flavor) - A small pinch of calcium/magnesium powder (optional, for added minerals) - Ice cubes (optional, for serving) - Fresh mint leaves (optional, for garnish and freshness) Instructions: 1. **Prepare the Citrus:** Squeeze fresh lemons and limes until you have 1/4 cup of juice from each fruit. The combination of these two citrus juices provides a refreshing taste and vitamin C. 2. **Mix the Sweetener:** In a pitcher or large jar, mix the honey or maple syrup with the sea salt. If you're using honey and it's a bit thick, you can gently warm it to make it easier to mix. The sweetness not only makes the drink more enjoyable but also can aid in faster absorption of the electrolytes. 3. **Combine Ingredients:** Add the lemon and lime juices to the sweetened salt mixture. Stir until everything is well dissolved. If you're using calcium/magnesium powder, add it at this stage. 4. **Add Water:** Pour in 2 cups of cold water or coconut water and mix well. Coconut water is a natural source of potassium and other electrolytes, making it an excellent base for an electrolyte drink. 5. **Taste and Adjust:** Taste your drink. If it’s too tart, add a bit more sweetener. If it's too sweet, balance it with an extra squeeze of lemon or lime juice. The right balance will depend on your personal preference and what tastes good to you. 6. **Chill:** Add ice cubes to cool the drink immediately, or refrigerate it for 30 minutes to an hour before serving. 7. **Serve:** Pour into a glass, garnish with fresh mint leaves if desired, and enjoy cold. Variation Ideas: - Use different juices: Instead of lemon and lime, try orange or grapefruit juice for a different flavor profile. - Add natural flavorings: A splash of vanilla extract or ginger can add an interesting twist to your electrolyte drink. - Make it fizzy: Replace half of the water with carbonated water for a sparkling version. This homemade electrolyte drink is not only delicious but also a healthy alternative to store-bought sports drinks, which can be high in added sugars and artificial ingredients. It’s perfect for rehydrating after exercise, during a hot day, or when you're feeling under the weather. Always listen to your body and adjust the ingredients according to your dietary needs and personal taste."},{"instruction":"1/4 cup lemon juice and lime juice how much lemon and lime?","output":"To get 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of lime juice, the exact number of lemons and limes you need can vary since the juice yield depends on the size and juiciness of the fruit. However, on average: - **For lemons:** It usually takes about 1 to 2 medium lemons to make 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Lemons can be quite variable in the amount of juice they contain, but a good general rule is that one medium lemon yields approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of juice. - **For limes:** You might need about 2 to 3 small to medium limes to yield 1/4 cup of lime juice. Like lemons, limes vary in their juiciness, but one medium lime typically produces about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of juice. Given these averages: - You'll likely need 1 to 2 medium lemons for the lemon juice. - And 2 to 3 medium limes for the lime juice. Remember, these are approximate numbers. The actual amount might vary, so it's always a good idea to have an extra lemon and lime on hand, especially if the ones you're using seem small or less juicy.

Explain it from scratch","output":"Growing a coconut tree in your backyard can be a fascinating and rewarding project if you live in an appropriate climate. Coconut palms thrive in tropical or subtropical climates, so if your area experiences frost or cold temperatures, it might be challenging to grow a coconut tree outdoors. Nonetheless, you can still attempt to grow one indoors or in a greenhouse with controlled conditions. Here's how to grow a coconut tree from scratch: # 1. Selecting the Right Coconut - **Start with a Fresh Coconut**: Choose a fresh, fully mature coconut with its husk still on. You can identify maturity by the amount of water you can hear inside when you shake it; more water typically indicates a younger coconut. However, for planting purposes, a mature coconut with less water and more meat is preferable. - **Soaking**: Soak the chosen coconut in water for two to three days. This helps to jumpstart the germination process. # 2. Germination Process - **Prepare for Planting**: After soaking, place the coconut in a container filled with well-draining potting mix, coir (coconut husk fiber), or a mixture of sand and peat. The container should have drainage holes. One-third of the coconut should sit above the soil surface, with the pointed end facing down. - **Ideal Conditions**: Keep the pot in a warm, humid environment, ideally with temperatures consistently above 75°F (24°C). Coconut palms love humidity, so if you live in a dry area, consider misting the coconut regularly or using a humidity tray. - **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Overwatering can cause the nut to rot. # 3. Caring for the Sprouting Coconut - **Sunlight**: Once the coconut sprouts and you notice a seedling emerging, gradually introduce the plant to more sunlight. Coconut palms eventually need full sunlight for optimal growth. - **Transplanting**: When the seedling becomes too big for its container — typically when it has developed several sets of leaves — it's time to transplant it to your backyard or a larger container. - **Spacing**: If planting outdoors, choose a spot with adequate space. Coconut trees can grow quite large, so ensure there's at least 20 feet of clearance from buildings or other trees. # 4. Outdoor Planting - **Soil Requirements**: Coconut palms prefer sandy, well-draining soil. They can tolerate a range of soil types as long as water doesn't accumulate around the roots. - **Planting Hole**: Dig a hole twice the size of the root ball of your coconut seedling. Gently place the seedling in the hole, making sure it's not deeper than it was in the container. Backfill with soil and water thoroughly. - **Watering**: Though mature coconut palms are drought tolerant, young trees need consistent moisture to establish themselves. Water the tree regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. # 5. Ongoing Care - **Fertilizing**: Coconut palms benefit from regular applications of palm fertilizer that is high in potassium, magnesium, and also contains micro-nutrients. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the best results. - **Pruning**: Minimal pruning is needed. Remove dead or damaged fronds to keep your tree healthy and tidy. # 6. Patience - **Growth Rate**: Coconut palms are relatively fast-growing under the right conditions but be patient. It may take 6-10 years for your coconut tree to mature and potentially bear fruit, depending on the variety and growing conditions. # Notes - **Climate**: If you don't live in a suitable climate and still want to try growing a coconut palm, consider growing it in a large pot indoors or in a greenhouse where you can control the temperature and humidity. - **Research Local Regulations**: Some areas regulate the planting of certain species, including coconut palms, due to factors like growth size, potential for invasiveness, or disease prevention. Always check local guidelines. Growing a coconut tree can be a long but rewarding process, offering both shade and beauty to your garden, and with luck, a supply of your own coconuts."},{"instruction":"How to grow a mango tree? Explain it from scratch","output":"Growing a mango tree from scratch can be a rewarding experience, giving you the dual benefits of a beautiful tree and delicious fruit. However, success largely depends on climate, as mangoes are tropical trees and need specific conditions to thrive. Here’s a step-by-step guide to growing a mango tree: # Choose the Right Seed 1. **Select a Ripe Mango**: Choose a ripe mango from a variety you love. The fruit should be fully ripe to ensure the seed inside is mature. 2. **Extract the Seed**: Cut open the mango and remove the husk containing the seed. Be careful not to cut through the husk and damage the seed inside. 3. **Prepare the Seed**: Clean the husk to remove any remaining fruit. You can either plant the whole husk or carefully open it to retrieve the seed. Some prefer to plant the cleaned husk directly, as it's less risky in terms of damaging the seed. # Start the Germination Process 4. **Germination Method 1 (Planting Directly)**: Plant the whole husk (or the extracted seed) in a pot filled with well-draining potting mix. Plant it about 2-3 inches deep and water thoroughly. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. 5. **Germination Method 2 (Pre-germination)**: Another method is to wrap the seed in a damp paper towel, place it in a plastic bag, and keep it in a warm place. Check periodically for sprouting and once the root starts to appear, plant it in soil. # Care During Germination and Early Growth 6. **Sunlight and Temperature**: Place the pot in a warm area but not in direct sunlight. Once the seed germinates and the seedling starts to grow, gradually move it to a spot where it receives more sunlight. 7. **Watering**: Keep the soil moist but be cautious of overwatering. # Transplanting 8. **When to Transplant**: Once the seedling outgrows its pot (you’ll see roots coming out of the drainage holes), it’s time to transplant it outdoors or into a larger pot. Ensure you’re in the right season (spring to early summer in most climates). 9. **Choosing the Location**: Mango trees need a sunny spot with well-draining soil. They are sensitive to cold, so pick a location that’s protected from cold winds. Ensure there’s enough space as mango trees can grow quite large. # Caring for Your Mango Tree 10. **Soil**: Mangoes prefer slightly acidic, sandy loam soil. Amend your soil with compost to improve its quality and drainage. 11. **Watering**: Young trees need more frequent watering to establish roots. Once established, mango trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but produce better fruit with regular, deep watering during the growing season, especially in dry climates. Reduce watering during the winter months. 12. **Fertilizing**: Use a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) during the first year to promote growth. As the tree matures, switch to a high potassium fertilizer to encourage fruit production. 13. **Pruning**: Pruning is essential for promoting healthy growth and fruit production. Prune when the tree is young to encourage a strong structure, and remove any dead or overcrowded branches. 14. **Pest and Disease Management**: Keep an eye out for pests and diseases common to mango trees in your area. Use appropriate treatments as needed, preferably opting for organic methods when possible. # Patience Is Key - It's important to note that mango trees grown from seed can take anywhere from 5 to 8 years or more to produce fruit. The fruit quality and characteristics might not be identical to the parent fruit because most commercially sold mangoes are hybrids. # Climate Conditions - Mango trees thrive in warm, tropical to subtropical climates. They are not frost-tolerant and can be severely damaged by cold temperatures. In cooler regions, mango trees can sometimes be grown in large pots and moved indoors during the coldest months, but this is challenging and may affect fruit production. With time, patience, and proper care, you can grow a healthy mango tree that provides shade and delicious fruits for years. Remember, growing a mango tree from seed is a long-term commitment, but the rewards are certainly worthwhile."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Le processus nécessite des connaissances de base en programmation. La plupart des bots Discord sont écrits en JavaScript avec Node.js, mais vous pouvez également utiliser d'autres langages comme Python. Voici les étapes de base pour créer votre bot Pomodoro : # Étape 1 : Configurer l'environnement de développement 1. **Installer Node.js et npm** : Assurez-vous d'avoir Node.js et npm (Node Package Manager) installés sur votre machine. npm est installé avec Node.js. 2. **Créer un nouveau dossier pour votre projet** : Ce dossier contiendra tous vos fichiers du bot. 3. **Initialiser un nouveau projet Node.js** : Ouvrez un terminal, naviguez vers votre dossier de projet et exécutez \`npm init\`. Répondez aux questions pour initialiser votre projet. # Étape 2 : Installer discord.js Discord.js est une bibliothèque puissante qui simplifie l'interaction avec l'API Discord. - Exécutez \`npm install discord.js\` dans votre terminal pour l'ajouter à votre projet. # Étape 3 : Créer un bot Discord 1. **Aller sur le portail développeur Discord** (https://discord.com/developers/applications) 2. **Créer une nouvelle application**, donnez-lui un nom. 3. **Allez dans l'onglet \\"Bot\\"** et cliquez sur \\"Add Bot\\". Vous verrez les détails de votre bot. 4. **Copiez le token de bot** qui vous sera nécessaire pour connecter votre bot à votre code. # Étape 4 : Programmer le Bot Dans votre éditeur de texte ou IDE, créez un fichier, par exemple \`bot.js\`, et commencez à programmer votre bot. Voici un exemple très basique de connexion de votre bot : \`\`\`js const Discord = require('discord.js'); const client = new Discord.Client(); client.once('ready', () => { console.log('Pomodoro Bot est en ligne !'); }); client.login('VOTRE_TOKEN_ICI'); \`\`\` # Étape 5 : Ajouter la logique du Pomodoro - **Définir les commandes** pour démarrer, arrêter et réinitialiser le Pomodoro. - **Implémenter un timer** qui suit la structure Pomodoro (par exemple, 25 minutes de travail suivies de 5 minutes de pause). - **Notifier l'utilisateur** quand il est temps de prendre une pause ou de reprendre le travail. Voici un pseudo-code pour illustrer comment vous pourriez implémenter la logique Pomodoro : \`\`\`js // Se concentrer sur la logique de base plutôt que sur des détails précis du code. client.on('message', message => { // Exemple d'écoute de commandes spécifiques if (message.content === '!startpomodoro') { // Démarrer un Pomodoro de 25 minutes } else if (message.content === '!stoppomodoro') { // Arrêter le Pomodoro en cours } // Ajoutez plus de logique ici pour gérer d'autres commandes et le cycle Pomodoro }); \`\`\` # Étape 6 : Exécutez votre Bot - Dans votre terminal, exécutez \`node bot.js\` pour démarrer votre bot. - Ajoutez le bot à votre serveur Discord en utilisant le lien OAuth2 généré dans le portail Discord Developer. # Étape 7 : Tester et ajuster - Testez toutes les fonctionnalités de votre bot sur votre serveur Discord. - Ajustez le code selon les retours et assurez-vous que tout fonctionne comme prévu. # Et voilà ! Vous avez créé un bot Pomodoro basique pour Discord. Bien sûr, il y a beaucoup plus à explorer et à ajouter. Vous pouvez améliorer votre bot en ajoutant une base de données pour suivre les sessions individuelles, en personnalisant les temps de travail/repos, ou même en intégrant des commandes plus complexes.

However, I can provide some educated speculation on what this concept might entail if we deconstruct the terms and extrapolate from existing practices and technologies. The word \\"neurophotography\\" is a combination of \\"neuro,\\" referring to the nervous system or brain, and \\"photography,\\" the art or practice of taking photographs. This combination suggests a connection or interplay between neurological processes and photography. Given this interpretation, there are a few areas where a concept like neurophotography sessions could potentially find relevance: 1. **Therapeutic Photography**: This is a known practice where photography is used as a tool for personal healing, growth, or understanding. While not specifically \\"neurophotography,\\" such sessions could involve participants engaging in photographic activities designed to influence mood, self-perception, or cognitive processes. The underlying mechanism could be considered neurological in the sense that any therapeutic effect would ultimately rely on changes in brain function. 2. **Biofeedback and Neurofeedback**: In biofeedback and neurofeedback therapies, individuals are provided with real-time feedback on their physiological or neurological states, with the goal of learning to control these processes. While traditionally this does not involve photography, one could imagine a hypothetical \\"neurophotography\\" session where visual images (potentially generated or modified in response to neural activity) are used as the feedback mechanism, aiming to influence or train certain brain functions. 3. **Art Therapy**: Art therapy uses the creative process of making art to improve a person's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. A \\"neurophotography session\\" could be an innovative form of art therapy where participants create or interact with photographs as a means to explore and understand their own cognitive and emotional processes. 4. **Cognitive and Emotional Processing**: There is research suggesting that engaging with certain types of visual stimuli can affect mood, stress levels, and cognitive functioning. A session designed around \\"neurophotography\\" might involve the use of specific photographic images or the task of taking photos in a way that is intended to produce beneficial neurological changes. 5. **Emerging Technologies**: With advancements in technology, there might be emerging practices that involve the intersection of neuroimaging and photography, such as using photographs to stimulate specific neural pathways or employing augmented reality (AR) to enhance neurotherapy sessions. These technologies could potentially offer new ways to visualize or interact with the neurological aspects of the human experience. Without more context or a specific description, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what neurophotography sessions might entail. If the concept is part of a novel therapeutic approach, an art project, or a technological innovation, it might not yet be widely known or might exist under a different name in professional practices. It's always fascinating to see how interdisciplinary approaches can lead to new methods for enhancing well-being, so if neurophotography sessions are emerging from such cross-pollination, they could represent an intriguing area for future development."},{"instruction":"опиши мне пост про нейрофотографии связанные с арт искусством","output":"Нейрофотография, сочетающая в себе нейронауку и искусство фотографии, открывает новые горизонты для понимания взаимосвязи между мозгом и творческим восприятием. Слияние этих двух областей позволяет нам глубже исследовать, как мы реагируем на визуальное искусство и что происходит в наших мозгах, когда мы взаимодействуем с фотографией как формой искусства. # Исследование восприятия искусства через нейрофотографию Исследователи используют техники нейровизуализации, такие как фМРТ (функциональная магнитно-резонансная томография), чтобы наблюдать за активностью мозга во время просмотра фотографических работ. Эти исследования помогают понять, какие области мозга активируются при эмоциональных реакциях на визуальное искусство, раскрывая связь между эстетическим удовольствием и когнитивными процессами. # Эмоциональное воздействие искусства через нейрофотографию Нейрофотография дает уникальную возможность исследовать эмоциональное влияние искусства на человека. Фотографии, вызывающие сильные эмоции или воспоминания, могут стимулировать определённые области мозга, связанные с эмоциональной обработкой. Это открытие может быть использовано в терапевтических целях, предлагая новые методы лечения через арт-терапию. # Творческий процесс и мозг Процесс создания фотографических произведений также может быть предметом исследования в контексте нейрофотографии. Анализируя активность мозга художников и фотографов во время работы над своими проектами, учёные могут получить представление о том, как творческий процесс воздействует на нейронные сети, а также как различные когнитивные и эмоциональные состояния влияют на творчество. # Нейроэстетика фотографии Отдельное направление, нейроэстетика, занимается изучением эстетического восприятия и его нейронных основ. В контексте фотографии нейроэстетика стремится понять, почему некоторые изображения считаются красивыми или вдохновляющими и как эти эстетические предпочтения отображаются в структуре и функциях мозга. Включение фотографии в исследования нейроэстетики открывает путь к глубокому пониманию взаимодействия между искусством и нейробиологией. # В заключение Нейрофотография как пункт соприкосновения арт-искусства и нейронауки обещает пролить свет на многие загадки человеческой психики и эстетического восприятия. От детального исследования эмоциональной реакции на визуальные образы до анализа творческого процесса и разработки новых подходов в терапии, нейрофотография предоставляет уникальные возможности для понимания глубинного взаимодействия между искусством и человеческим мозгом."},{"instruction":"напиши мне пост о женской футболке с принтом","output":"# Освежите свой гардероб: Женская футболка с принтом, которая говорит больше, чем слова!

Programar en VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) para realizar tareas automatizadas en Excel como la que mencionas es bastante útil. Lo que quieres hacer es buscar la primera columna vacía dentro de un rango específico para luego escribir datos en ella. A continuación, voy a darte un ejemplo paso a paso de cómo podrías hacerlo. # Paso 1: Acceder al Editor de VBA Primero, necesitas abrir el Editor de VBA. Puedes hacer esto presionando \`ALT + F11\` en Excel. Esto abrirá el Editor de VBA. # Paso 2: Insertar un nuevo módulo Ahora, necesitas insertar un nuevo módulo donde escribirás tu código. En el menú, ve a \`Insertar\` > \`Módulo\`. Esto creará un nuevo módulo en blanco. # Paso 3: Escribe el código A continuación, un ejemplo de código que busca la primera columna vacía en un rango predeterminado y escribe algo en las celdas de esa columna. Antes de usar el código, ajusta las referencias de hoja y el rango según lo necesites. \`\`\`vba Sub BuscarPrimeraColumnaVaciaEInsertarDatos() Dim hoja As Worksheet Dim rango As Range Dim columna As Long Dim rangoColumna As Range Dim primeraColumnaVacia As Long ' Ajusta \\"Hoja1\\" al nombre de tu hoja Set hoja = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\\"Hoja1\\") ' Ajusta el rango donde deseas buscar la primera columna vacía Set rango = hoja.Range(\\"A1:C10\\") ' Ejemplo: A1:C10 ' Inicializa la variable que tendrá el número de la primera columna vacía primeraColumnaVacia = 0 ' Busca la primera columna vacía For columna = 1 To rango.Columns.Count Set rangoColumna = rango.Columns(columna) If Application.WorksheetFunction.CountA(rangoColumna) = 0 Then ' Guarda el número de la primera columna vacía primeraColumnaVacia = columna Exit For End If Next columna ' Comprueba si se encontró una columna vacía y escribe los datos If primeraColumnaVacia > 0 Then ' La referencia se ajusta basándose en el rango inicial y el número de la primera columna vacía Set rangoColumna = rango.Columns(primeraColumnaVacia) ' Ejemplo para escribir en las celdas de la columna encontrada rangoColumna.Cells(1, 1).Value = \\"Datos\\" ' Añade más líneas como la anterior para rellenar más celdas en la columna vacía Else MsgBox \\"No se encontró ninguna columna vacía en el rango especificado.\\", vbExclamation End If End Sub \`\`\` Este script primero define el rango donde quieres buscar (en este ejemplo se ha usado \\"A1:C10\\" en la hoja llamada \\"Hoja1\\"). Luego, itera a través de las columnas dentro de ese rango buscando una columna donde todas las celdas están vacías. Cuando encuentra la primera columna vacía, escribe \\"Datos\\" en la primera celda de esa columna. Puedes modificar esta parte del código para escribir lo que necesites. # Paso 4: Ejecutar el código Puedes ejecutar este código yendo al Editor de VBA, seleccionando el procedimiento \`BuscarPrimeraColumnaVaciaEInsertarDatos\` y presionando \`F5\`. Recuerda ajustar los detalles del código, como el nombre de la hoja y el rango específico según tus necesidades. Así como también, adaptar o expandir la parte del código que escribe los datos según lo que quieras lograr. Espero que este ejemplo te sirva para empezar. ¡Suerte con tu proyecto!"},{"instruction":"puedes modificarme el siguiente código para que en lugar de buscar la última fila de un rango, busque la última columna?","output":"Claro, puedo ayudarte a ajustar el código para buscar la última columna de un rango en lugar de la última fila. El enfoque general para encontrar la última columna es similar al de encontrar la última fila, pero utilizaremos la función \`.Column\` y ajustaremos el enfoque para extenderse a lo largo de las columnas en lugar de las filas. Supongamos que tienes un código base que se ve así para la última fila: \`\`\`vba Sub EncontrarUltimaFila() Dim ultimaFila As Long With ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\\"Hoja1\\") ultimaFila = .Cells(.Rows.Count, \\"A\\").End(xlUp).Row MsgBox \\"La última fila con datos en la columna A es: \\" & ultimaFila End With End Sub \`\`\` Ahora, para modificarlo y encontrar la última columna con datos en una fila específica (por ejemplo, en la fila 1), podrías ajustar el código de la siguiente manera: \`\`\`vba Sub EncontrarUltimaColumna() Dim ultimaColumna As Long With ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\\"Hoja1\\") ' Cambiamos Rows.Count por Columns.Count y \\"A\\" por 1, además de usar .Column y xlToLeft ultimaColumna = .Cells(1, .Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column ' Nota: El 1 en .Cells(1, .Columns.Count) especifica la fila 1, cámbialo según sea necesario MsgBox \\"La última columna con datos en la fila 1 es: \\" & ultimaColumna End With End Sub \`\`\` En este código, \`.Cells(1, .Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column\` se usa para encontrar la última columna en la fila 1 que tiene datos. Comenzamos desde la última columna posible \`.Columns.Count\` en una fila específica (fila 1 en este caso), y luego usamos \`.End(xlToLeft)\` para mover hacia la izquierda hasta encontrar la última celda que contiene datos, finalmente usamos \`.Column\` para obtener el número de esta columna. Recuerda, si deseas buscar a lo largo de otra fila, simplemente cambia el \`1\` en \`.Cells(1, .Columns.Count)\` al número de fila deseado.

Таким образом, это скорее психологический комфорт, чем часть лечения или медицинской процедуры."},{"instruction":"Мой китайский друг говорит, что это было лекарство.","output":"Если ваш китайский друг утверждает, что это было лекарство, возможно, имеются в виду конфеты, содержащие лечебные травы или добавки. В Китае широко распространена практика использования традиционной китайской медицины (ТКМ), которая может включать в себя лекарственные травы, корни, и даже лекарственные конфеты. Такие продукты могут использоваться для улучшения общего самочувствия или как дополнение к лечению различных состояний. Однако, если речь идет о стандартной практике вакцинации, то конфета, данная после прививки, скорее всего, не является частью лечения. Возможно, ваш друг имел в виду, что конкретно эта конфета содержала какие-то добавки, полезные для здоровья или восстановления организма после стресса, связанного с вакцинацией. Для получения точной информации лучше всего обратиться к врачу, который давал конфету, уточнить ее состав и предназначение."},{"instruction":"Я слышал, что есть конфеты от полиомиелита","output":"Да, вы абсолютно правы. Существует оральная вакцина против полиомиелита, которая представляет собой капли, которые вводятся в рот ребенка. В некоторых случаях и странах использовались также \\"вакцинные таблетки\\" или \\"конфеты\\", содержащие ослабленный вирус полиомиелита. Эти таблетки являются альтернативой инъекционной вакцине и позволяют эффективно прививать детей без использования инъекций. Оральная вакцина (ОПВ, оральная полиовакцина) была разработана Альбертом Сабиным и представляет собой живую аттенуированную (ослабленную) вакцину. Она показала высокую эффективность в борьбе с полиомиелитом по всему миру, способствуя значительному сокращению числа случаев заболевания. ОПВ обычно представляет собой капли, которые непосредственно капают в рот ребенка, но концепция \\"конфеты от полиомиелита\\" относится к тому же принципу легкости и простоты применения, особенно в регионах с ограниченным доступом к медицинским учреждениям или в рамках массовых вакцинационных кампаний. Таким образом, ваше упоминание конфет от полиомиелита корректно в контексте обсуждения различных форм предоставления вакцины, хотя в современной практике обычно используются капли."},{"instruction":"Я слышал, что в СССР были разработаны вакцина в виде вкусных конфет от полиомиелита.","output":"Действительно, в СССР проводились разработки и исследования по созданию вакцины против полиомиелита в форме, максимально удобной и приемлемой для детей. Одна из таких инновационных форм – это введение вакцины в виде \\"конфет\\". Это была оральная полиовакцина, которая давалась детям для проглатывания, что представляло собой более приятную альтернативу инъекциям. Концепция заключалась в том, чтобы сделать вакцинацию менее стрессовой для детей и более легко осуществимой в масштабах страны, особенно в условиях, когда организовать массовую вакцинацию с использованием инъекций было бы затруднительно. Использование оральной формы вакцины также способствовало быстрому и широкому охвату населения, что было крайне важно для эффективного контроля и предотвращения распространения полиомиелита. Хотя вакцина в виде конфет стала значительным достижением, самым распространенным и широко используемым методом остается капельная форма оральной вакцины, представленная в виде нескольких капель жидкости, которые вводятся в рот ребенка. Этот метод доказал свою эффективность во всем мире и сыграл ключевую роль в борьбе с полиомиелитом. Таким образом, идея введения вакцины в форме конфет являлась одним из многочисленных творческих подходов к вакцинации, разработанных для упрощения процесса инокуляции и повышения его приемлемости среди населения, особенно среди детей."},{"instruction":"Filter It only amounted to one, and it would always be one and never two —and through his jaundice-soaked corneas, all he could see was nausea. Suddenly, a violent heave claimed him, a primal urge rising in his liver. Bile stained his teeth, and the following retches were acidic, lashing the roof of his mouth with fury. It could never stop: his body rejected the substance over and over; he was dangling on the edge of sanity . “Not again. Please no-” Liam clenched his teeth, the crucial moment upon him; he had to keep the substance down, or the consequences would be dire. His eyes scanned the horizon with desperation before his lids slid closed, resistance wracking him. Then, as the urge to be sick overcame him, a voice pierced through his fog of despair, a lifeline amidst his struggle. “Can you hear me?” the rough, concerned tone asked as Liam writhed against the concrete, groaning… “Don’t try to answer that, but try to blink twice. Take it slow.” As he fought to drag his eyelids upward, the pain, like a coiling wire, constricted his blood flow in retaliation. “Make it stop-No I-” he choked out , his voice puncturing the air. If he expelled the Vanderine from his intestines, his efforts would to amount to zero. Square one. He was at the end of a long night,his vision raw from never resting his eyes, the blood vessels all but ruptured and torn. The ingested substance had been a sinister mistake. And if he threw up twice, the Vanderine risked expulsion from his system; he battled to hold it inside. All he had could never be enough, he countered, what ever could? Even his attempts to obey the voice , coming from somewhere above him, seemed in vain. As Liam writhed in the dying sunlight, his skin erupted in feverish bumps, a crawling sensation exploring the surface of his skin. Violation jolted down his spine as he screamed through his clenched teeth . As the nausea rose again, claiming his entire being, his heart continued to pulse, counting away the seconds. “Help me—No. No,” he pled through his locking jaw as he fought another gripe. The instinctive reaction of his body gripped every fiber as he felt his fight ending. He embedded his teeth into his gag, screaming against the material bound across his tongue, taunting him. Then, in one dreaded motion, the inevitable rise built within him. His pupils dilated with horror as his gag soon became saturated with the vile substance, leaving a bitter sting as he struggled against it; the retches that followed heaving through his chest. Liam collapsed into the unforgiving embrace of the concrete, his ravaged body welcoming the end with resignation. “Shit,” he lamented , the heat in his own voice spreading across his flesh like untamed fire . “Twice… now it’s too late.” Twisting his gaze away from the glistening pool of Vanderine, he diverted his gaze from the evident failure. And in a mixture of pure shock and trauma, his eyelids slid closed with exhaustion, his body embracing closure of his fight. After his ongoing efforts and endless torment, he failed to hold down the vandarine, and it was over. But the voice persisted, causing Liam to force his eyes open, gritting his teeth. “No, I’m still here Liam; I’m getting the binds off—hang tight,” the voice reassured. Liam shook his head , protesting, the fear tugging at his psyche like a fishing line as he cursed in his mouth. “No, you can’t help—” As Liam fought to refocus his gaze, a pair of deep hazel eyes locked onto his own with concern. “Hey, breathe. I’ve got you. It’s me, Ry’. Hold on while I get rid of this—” Liam flinched as his gag tore from his mouth, and he gasped for fresh air, the stifling atmosphere saturating him with perspiration. “Now hang tight while I get these damned binds off-“ , Ryan’s voice reassured with an undercurrent of urgency, as Liam’s arms obstructed his ribcage from accomodating his lungs. Liam’s voice died in his throat as the sear of rope twisted itself around his flesh , grinding like wildfire into his veins as Ryan worked at the constraints with bare hands. His deft fingers delivered frantic sensations into Liam’s malaise as they eroded the rope’s grained surface, causing the fibres to snap. Then, as Ryan tossed the strews of rope aside, he rolled Liam onto his back, smoothing a palm over his chest and anchoring his sternum. “Ryan? How the hell did you get out of your?” , Liam questioned in untamed confusion, shocks coursing down his spine as Ryan elevated his head and hauled it onto his thigh. “ It took a hell of a long time to wear down my own, but I managed to-ah it doesn’t matter , just concentrate on the breathing.” As his head lolled to the side , Liam’s laboured breaths stalled his movements , the horizon meeting his vision while Ryan held his jaw in place . “Easy, slow breaths, feel how I’m breathing buddy and mirror that.” It was a few minutes before Liam’s chest finally fell into a rhythm, his spasmodic breathing evening out. “There we go, give it some time, it’s been a long damn night.”, Ryan said, his hands remaining secure against Liam’s face as he refocused his vision on Ryan’s steady gaze. Liam, reaching up and gripping Ryan’s arm, smiled against the warm twilight rays of daylight that bathed his features. “Hell of a thing to endure, seeing all that… Damn lucky that we’re both still here.” Liam, pulling on Ryan’s arm, found the strength to prop himself into a seated position, still deprived of breath. “Shit. Get over here, Ry’” he said, as streams of magenta dust hovered , creating a surreal haze that reflected the rising sun. Liam raised his arm and enveloped Ryan in a warm but rough embrace , melding their silhouettes into one as their shoulders collided. As Liam delivered a thump to his back, Ryan reciprocated by bumping his fist against Liam’s shoulder. “Yeah, yeah, calm down,” Ryan laughed in spite of his cool demeanour. “We’ll get a decent shot of water into you, after we find your clothes.” Ryan, lowering his deep hazel irises to meet Liam’s contrasting blue stare , placed a hand on Liam’s knee. “thank God I reached you in time.” Although the light had drained from his eyes , Liam managed a smirk. “Yeah, I know what you did Ry’ . It’s all kinda hazy but-“ Ryan dodged the heroics as he offered a smile and turned his head, the hues of the ominous sunrise casting across his profile , promising impending heat. “Nah, I don’t go down easy or nothin’ but someone had to save your ass.” Passage two \\"The sight of his crumpled jeans, smudged with fingerprints, hijacked his attention. “Those bastards don’t care what they leave behind,” Liam muttered as his eyes located his left sock, freezing his joints. “Please help me-“ he whispered, readjusting his grip on Ryan’s shoulder, wrenching his gaze away from the twisted display of inhumanity. Liam’s jaw clenched as he then noticed his dehumanizing undergarments strewn across the footpath, along with his boots and shirt. Ryan held his gaze steadfast on Liam’s faltering eyes as he approached Liam’s belongings, gathering them and subverting the underwear, scuffing it away with his boot. Liam was already sliding toward the dusty ground as Ryan handed him the brusque garments, his expression gentle. “You earned your dignity, just focus on that,” he reassured as Liam accepted his ruined clothing with a wince. “Yeah, give me a minute-“ he said with a glimmer of resistance in his bloodshot eyes. The drugs in his vision burned with a harsh sting, and Liam shook his head to regain some clarity. “I don’t remember how I got here. No damn clue. Now here I am stripped naked- Ry’, I’m not even sure what’s real or what the Vanderine made me believe—and I only said yes because -”. With a jerk, Ryan pulled Liam inward by the waist. “Doesn’t matter. We never had a choice. But you put yourself in my place. And they never broke your damn spirit. And I can tell you right now, this is real.” Liam, looking away with a nod, fell into silence as he wrestled with the task of dressing himself. Ryan was quick to offer careful attention as he assisted Liam into his jeans. The denim, rough against his bare skin, left his bite crooked with agony. Each movement caused Liam to flinch as he guided his ankle through the hem and then buttoned the waist of the stained jeans . Ryan passed him his destroyed Henley , and Liam yanked it over his shoulders. With a groan , Liam sought leverage in Ryan’s grasp, haling himself upright. “Can you walk? Coz we need to find water , c’mon Li’ , sweet hydration awaits-“. As Liam broke into a grin that reached his pupils with a spark , his feet found equilibrium alongside Ryan’s stance. “Hell yeah-I’m dyin’ of thirst-“ . But as they attempted to leave, Liam’s breath was stolen by confronting remnants of his ordeal. He steeled his grip on Ryan’s arm as his eyes swept over the discarded bottle of lubricant and plastic glove, turned inside-out on the pavement. “Sick, perverted bastards.” Ryan almost spat as his heart was seized by the disarray that had paralysed Liam. Shielded only by Ryan’s insistence as he guided Liam past the aftermath , he whispered, his tone punctured with disbelief. “So you’re outta your binds and you untied mine, stripped my gag -and-“ Liam’s head fell to his hand , cradling his temple and gritting his teeth. “A lot of what happened is ..missing Ry’ -how many times did they?“ Ryan responded with a gun-metal hollowness, his words smoked out by his steady exhale. “Several times at least . Enough times enough for anyone, let’s say that.” Liam disengaged himself from Ryan’s grasp as he diverted the glare that was already rebounding off the asphalt . “I wish you hadn’t been forced to watch-“ Ryan dragged his legs into co-operation as he anchored himself against Liam. “It was hard yeah-but what they did-I know you think it was a mistake to say yes , but my mistake was to resist-“ The air clung to his flesh as Liam dragged his knuckles over his vision , finding a semblance of composure as he argued. “How the hell was it a mistake to avoid-this? Don’t you go getting all survivor’s guilt on me Ry. “ The amber flecks dissolved from Ryan’s aspect as he mumbled at the ground , grinding his hands into his pockets. “I just , never mind. We both need water, and shade. And soon.” Liam slung a recuperating arm around Ryan’s shoulder , and staggered in sync with his footsteps as the navigated the footpath as it winded into potential oblivion… As they walked in shared disorientation, and noon encroached, Liam’s psyche was flooded with a flashback. His hand flew to his temple, clutching his hair as the thumping blades of a chopper cut through his thoughts. The unforgiving smash of his torso onto the ground, the impact coursing down his spine as he thrashed across the dirt and onto the pavement, echoed through his chest. “They threw me from a chopper, Ryan, arms bound to my sides. Did they do the same to you? Please tell me you know more than you’ve been letting on-“ At first Ryan hesitated, his words dead on his tongue as he swiped it across his teeth , as he stared out into the distance. “Yeah, after you, they hurled me down here , and I found myself staring into the barrel of a gun. Said there were more captives , but nothing about their sick intentions. Then you know the rest-“ With a somber nod, Liam added “Yeah, they brandish the damned pistol in my face and -“ Liam exhaled into the particles of oppressive dirt and debris as his posture slackened with the sobering reality of the moment . “I already feel like they’ve killed me, Ry’. And they’ll be back. They’ll kill us like dogs-“ Ryan’s complexion drained out a shade of its colour and he shifted his weight under Liam’s one sided embrace, maintaining his stare into the spanning horizon. “Well, I’m guessin’ they could zone in on us at any moment, and while I’ve out walked my limits, it’s probably only been under a mile. But as I said before , I don’t go down easy. “ he said, his detached voice peppered with defiance. “Hell yeah you don’t “ Liam’s appreciative chuckle warmed the air along with a resonating smile, shrugging Ryan into closer proximity and supporting his weight. “If I live to see a stiff drink, I owe you . Speaking of which-“. Ryan’s eyes followed Liam’s to a ransacked dumpster further up the path, garbage cascading onto the concrete. “Liam, I don’t know that I’m above crawling in there to get out of this sun…just pull the lid down and die of dehy-“ Liam interjected as his eyes caught on several bottles of water , his relief interspersed through his laughter. “Don’t finish that thought Ry’ , I think we might not be the only survivors out here after all-“","output":"The passage you've provided is a vivid narrative, demonstrating strong character development and a dynamic interaction between Liam and Ryan amidst a palpable backdrop of adversity and trauma.

Cependant, je peux donner une description détaillée et des aperçus techniques pour les deux sujets: Lambris en plastique et Plexiglas, en particulier en ce qui concerne leur utilisation comme faux plafond. **1) Lambris en plastique pour faux plafonds** **Description:** Les lambris en plastique sont une option populaire pour les faux plafonds en raison de leur polyvalence, de leur résistance à l'humidité, et de leur facilité d'installation. Elles sont souvent utilisées dans les salles de bains, cuisines, ou d'autres endroits sujets à l'humidité. Ces lamelles en plastique peuvent ressembler à du bois, du métal ou avoir des couleurs uniformes selon le traitement de surface. **Mise en oeuvre:** La mise en œuvre des lambris en plastique pour créer un faux plafond commence généralement par l'installation d'une structure de support, souvent faite de métal ou de bois. Cette structure peut être fixée directement au plafond existant ou suspendue par des câbles ou des tiges, permettant l'installation de systèmes électriques, de ventilation, ou d'isolation au-dessus du faux plafond. Les lambris en plastique sont ensuite clipsés ou vissés sur cette structure. L'avantage est que ces panneaux peuvent facilement être découpés pour s'adapter autour des obstacles et permettre l'intégration de luminaires ou d'autres éléments de plafond. **2) Plexiglas pour faux plafonds** **Description:** Le Plexiglas, un type spécifique de polyméthacrylate de méthyle (PMMA), est utilisé pour créer des faux plafonds élégants et modernes. Transparent ou en couleurs, il laisse passer la lumière et peut être utilisé pour créer des effets visuels impressionnants. Les plafonds en Plexiglas peuvent être lisses ou texturés, et des éclairages à LED situés aux bords peuvent transformer le plafond en une source de lumière. **Mise en œuvre:** La mise en œuvre d'un faux plafond en Plexiglas est similaire à celle des lambris en plastique, nécessitant une structure de support. Cependant, la manipulation du Plexiglas demande davantage de précision due à sa nature fragile. Le Plexiglas peut être vissé sur la structure avec des vis spéciales qui ne causent pas de fissures, ou il peut être accroché dans des cadres qui le maintiennent fermement en place. Pour les grandes surfaces, il est important de prendre en compte la dilatation thermique du matériau. Étant donné que le Plexiglas peut se dilater ou se contracter en fonction de la température, il doit être installé avec un petit jeu pour éviter toute tension et fissuration. **Note Technique:** Dans les deux cas, l'installation d'un faux plafond en lambris plastique ou en Plexiglas nécessite de prendre en compte l'accessibilité future pour la maintenance, ainsi l'installation doit permettre un démontage partiel sans endommager l'ensemble du plafond.

A empresa utilizará ferramentas tecnológicas avançadas e adotará práticas sustentáveis para se posicionar como uma opção contemporânea e ética no mercado. O modelo operacional prevê a valorização dos insights setoriais do promotor para antecipar tendências e adaptar-se proactivamente às mudanças do mercado, visando estabelecer a empresa como líder no fornecimento de serviços administrativos especializados. OBJECTIVOS - Curto prazo: Estabelecer a empresa como um parceiro confiável para PMEs e startups em Viana do Castelo e regiões limítrofes, atingindo um segmento de mercado potencial estimado em aproximadamente 2.500 empresas. - Médio prazo: Consolidar a presença no mercado regional, oferecendo soluções personalizadas que ultrapassem os desafios administrativos enfrentados pelo mercado-alvo, visando uma expansão para o mercado nacional através de serviços remotos. - Longo prazo: Expandir a oferta de serviços em nível internacional, capitalizando sobre o potencial crescente da terceirização remota de processos administrativos e posicionando a empresa como um player importante no mercado global de serviços administrativos externalizados. Através da implementação destas estratégias e o alcance destes objetivos, o projeto almeja fornecer uma solução integrada que combine eficiência operacional com um custo-benefício equilibrado. Este conceito de negócio, apoiado por um promotor com competências e experiência robustas, está preparado para atender às necessidades de um mercado dinâmico e em expansão. MERCADO ALVO O mercado-alvo principal são as pequenas e médias empresas (PME) e startups, com uma faturação anual até 3 milhões de euros e equipas até 50 colaboradores. Estas empresas ambicionam otimizar recursos e focalizar-se no seu negócio principal, externalizando serviços administrativos especializados que permitam a redução de custos operacionais e proporcionem acesso a competências qualificadas sem obrigações de longa duração. Inicialmente, o foco incidirá sobre as PME e startups dos sectores tecnológico, de serviços profissionais, consultoria e comércio, situadas em Viana do Castelo e regiões limítrofes. Estima-se que exista um mercado potencial de aproximadamente 2.500 empresas que correspondem a este perfil na área de atuação inicial (Fonte: Censo Empresarial de Viana do Castelo, Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2020). Este segmento de clientes enfrenta habitualmente desafios como a sobrecarga da equipa interna com tarefas administrativas de rotina (gestão documental, faturação, contabilidade básica), a dificuldade em contratar e reter talento administrativo qualificado, e a necessidade de apoio específico para projetos e eventos particulares (Fonte: “Desafios Administrativos de PME”, Revista Portuguesa de Gestão, 2019). A nossa proposta apresenta uma solução abrangente que não só ultrapassa esses impedimentos através de serviços administrativos externalizados e especializados, mas também promove um aumento da eficiência operacional geral, oferecendo uma relação custo-benefício excepcional. Este valor é potenciado pelos atributos competitivos distintivos do promotor, que se traduzem em vantagens como o incremento da produtividade, apoio linguístico melhorado e soluções personalizadas em conformidade com as tendências de inovação, proporcionando valor acrescentado aos clientes além da poupança de custos (Fonte: Relatório “Benefícios da Externalização de Serviços Administrativos”, Associação Portuguesa de Empresas de Serviços Partilhados, 2022). Após a consolidação no mercado regional, a estratégia antevê a expansão para a oferta de serviços remotos a nível nacional e, numa fase posterior, internacional, capitalizando o potencial crescente da terceirização remota de processos administrativos (Fonte: Estudo “Tendências Globais de Externalização de Serviços Administrativos”, Consultoria XYZ, 2021). Tendências como a digitalização, o destaque na eficiência operacional e a externalização estratégica de atividades não essenciais sublinham as perspectivas de uma procura contínua e crescente por soluções como a nossa, que está posicionada para satisfazer e exceder as necessidades deste mercado-alvo apelativo e em ampliação (Fonte: Relatório “Futuro do Trabalho Administrativo”, Organização Internacional do Trabalho, 2020). Para uma análise aprofundada do mercado-alvo, segmentaremos as PMEs e startups com base no seu setor de atividade, volume de negócios, e necessidades específicas de apoio administrativo. A tendência crescente para a digitalização das operações destaca uma oportunidade particular para serviços especializados nesta área, assim como a gestão de eventos e projetos, onde a nossa oferta se pode diferenciar. Dados do Instituto Nacional de Estatística indicam que, em Viana do Castelo, aproximadamente 70% das empresas enquadram-se no perfil definido como nosso mercado-alvo, evidenciando um potencial significativo para a penetração e expansão de mercado. A análise competitiva revela que, embora existam prestadores de serviços similares, poucos oferecem um pacote integrado e personalizado como o nosso, posicionando-nos de forma vantajosa para captar este segmento. ESTRATÉGIAS PARA CONQUISTAR O MERCADO ALVO A estratégia de implementação do projeto será estruturada em fases definidas, começando com o estabelecimento da infraestrutura básica e o lançamento de uma campanha de marketing digital nos primeiros 3 meses. Até ao sexto mês, focar-nos-emos na consolidação da nossa base de clientes em Viana do Castelo, utilizando uma abordagem direta e parcerias estratégicas locais. A partir daí, expandiremos progressivamente os serviços para o mercado nacional. A estrutura organizacional será ágil, inicialmente centrada no promotor, mas com planos de recrutar dois assistentes administrativos dentro de dois/três anos, conforme o crescimento dos negócios. Para o desenvolvimento desta atividade assenta numa abordagem multifacetada, que visa não apenas estabelecer uma sólida presença digital e desenvolver um robusto networking profissional, mas também firmar parcerias estratégicas com outras empresas e fornecedores de serviços. Este modelo operacional será fundamentado na adoção de ferramentas tecnológicas avançadas e na incorporação de práticas sustentáveis, ressaltando o compromisso da empresa com a responsabilidade social e ambiental. Tal posicionamento almeja destacar a empresa no mercado como uma opção contemporânea e ética, alinhada com os valores de potenciais clientes e parceiros que priorizam a sustentabilidade e a inovação. A experiência prévia do promotor, que inclui ampla competência em gestão administrativa e apoio a projetos, bem como especialização em áreas críticas como gestão de eventos e consultoria em gestão energética, representa um pilar fundamental para a concretização desta estratégia. Estes conhecimentos e habilidades, aliados a uma proficiência comprovada em comunicação interpessoal e negociação, oferecem uma base sólida para a implementação de soluções personalizadas que atendam às necessidades específicas de cada cliente. Adicionalmente, a capacidade de liderança e gestão de equipes multidisciplinares, adquirida ao longo dos anos em diversos contextos profissionais, será crucial para garantir a eficácia operacional e a satisfação do cliente. A estratégia contempla ainda a valorização dos insights adquiridos em diferentes sectores de atividade, o que permite antecipar tendências e adaptar-se proactivamente às mudanças do mercado. Este aspeto é particularmente relevante num contexto empresarial dinâmico, onde a capacidade de resposta rápida e inovadora pode significar a diferença entre o sucesso e a estagnação. Deste modo, a implementação da atividade será dinamizada através da combinação estratégica de tecnologia, sustentabilidade e experiência, visando não só atrair uma clientela diversificada, mas também estabelecer a empresa como líder no fornecimento de serviços administrativos e de apoio a projetos. A atenção ao detalhe, a personalização do serviço e a constante busca por excelência serão os alicerces desta abordagem, garantindo assim que a empresa não apenas atenda, mas exceda as expectativas dos seus clientes. Para garantir a sustentabilidade e competitividade a longo prazo, a empresa compromete-se com a inovação contínua dos seus serviços e processos. Isto inclui o investimento em formação para manter a equipa ao corrente das últimas tendências tecnológicas e de gestão, bem como o desenvolvimento de novas ofertas de serviços baseadas na análise de necessidades emergentes do mercado. Planos de expansão futura incluem a diversificação para novos setores, como o aluguer de audiovisuais, e a exploração de modelos de negócios disruptivos, tais como plataformas de intermediação de serviços administrativos, aumentando a nossa área de atuação e valor acrescentado para os clientes. Assim, encaramos esta jornada com confiança, fundamentada numa estratégia de implementação coerente e um promotor com as competências e a experiência necessárias para transformar visão em realidade.

Com base no exemplo seguinte, cria a ANÁLISE ECONÓMICO-FINANCEIRA para o projeto em epigrafe:","output":"Para elaborar uma análise econômico-financeira do projeto apresentado anteriormente, precisamos explorar diversos aspectos financeiros essenciais que influenciam a viabilidade e o sucesso do negócio. Estes aspectos incluem a projeção de receitas, a estimação de custos fixos e variáveis, a análise do ponto de equilíbrio, e a previsão de fluxo de caixa. Vamos desdobrar cada um desses aspectos para proporcionar uma compreensão clara da análise econômico-financeira do projeto. # 1. Projeção de Receitas Para projetar as receitas, vamos considerar o mercado-alvo identificado de PMEs e startups, o preço dos serviços oferecidos e a capacidade do promotor de captar clientes de forma eficaz. Assumindo uma estratégia de marketing acertada e uma adoção progressiva dos serviços oferecidos, pode-se esperar uma taxa de crescimento anual nas receitas. A projeção inicial poderia ser conservadora, aumentando com a expansão para mercados nacionais e internacionais. **Ano 1:** €50,000 (iniciando e estabelecendo a base de clientes) **Ano 2:** €75,000 (expansão de serviços e base de clientes robusta) **Ano 3:** €100,000 (expansão nacional e desenvolvimento de novos serviços) # 2. Custos Fixos e Variáveis **Custos Fixos** incluem aluguel do espaço, seguros, salários fixos (inicialmente para o promotor), e custos de serviços de internet e telecomunicações. Supondo que o promotor receba um salário modesto e o custo fixo total efetivo seja de cerca de €20,000 anuais. **Custos Variáveis** poderiam envolver despesas com marketing, custos de transação, material de escritório, e potencialmente custos variáveis associados à prestação de serviços. Estima-se que os custos variáveis representem cerca de 20% das receitas. # 3. Análise do Ponto de Equilíbrio O ponto de equilíbrio ocorre quando as receitas totais igualam os custos totais (fixos e variáveis). Considerando os custos fixos e a estimativa de que os custos variáveis sejam 20% das receitas, podemos calcular o ponto de equilíbrio para cada ano. **Ano 1:** Custos Fixos = €20,000 Custos Variáveis = 20% de 50,000 = €10,000 Ponto de Equilíbrio = €30,000 **Ano 2 e Ano 3:** A lógica seguiria de forma similar, ajustando-se conforme o crescimento das receitas e potencial redução de custos variáveis (devido a economias de escala). # 4. Fluxo de Caixa A projeção de fluxo de caixa levará em conta as entradas (receitas) e saídas (custos fixos e variáveis) de caixa mensalmente. É crucial incorporar o capital inicial de €10,000.00 como uma entrada no início do projeto para cobrir as despesas iniciais e como buffer para as operações iniciais. Para os primeiros meses, pode-se esperar um fluxo de caixa negativo à medida que o negócio se estabelece. No entanto, à medida que os clientes começam a aderir aos serviços e as receitas se estabilizam, espera-se um fluxo de caixa positivo. # 5. Análise de Viabilidade A análise de viabilidade seria realizada considerando todas as variáveis acima e avaliando indicadores como o Valor Presente Líquido (VPL) e a Taxa Interna de Retorno (TIR), incorporando uma taxa de desconto realista para calcular o valor temporal do dinheiro. # Conclusão Com base nestas projeções e análises, o projeto parece financeiramente saudável, com potencial de crescimento e expansão. No entanto, é crucial que o promotor mantenha uma gestão financeira rigorosa, monitore as métricas de desempenho de perto e esteja preparado para ajustar as estratégias conforme necessário para mitigar riscos e capitalizar sobre oportunidades emergentes."},{"instruction":"what is your name?","output":"I am a language model AI created by OpenAI.

For this task, we'll use the Hugging Face Transformers library along with PyTorch. Make sure you've installed both libraries. You can install Transformers by running \`pip install transformers\` and PyTorch by following the instructions on the [official PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This guide will outline a simple approach for fine-tuning a pre-trained Arabic language model on the question answering task with the aim of generating questions based on answers. # Step 1: Dataset Preparation First, load and preprocess your SQuAD-like dataset. We assume that your dataset is structured similarly to SQuAD, with context paragraphs, questions, and answers. For this demonstration, your dataset should be pre-processed into a format that resembles: \`\`\`python [ {\\"context\\": \\"The context paragraph text in Arabic.\\", \\"question\\": \\"The corresponding question?\\", \\"answer\\": \\"The answer to the question.\\" }, ... ] \`\`\` For simplicity, this example uses a pseudo-code structure and won't include the loading and preprocessing steps. Please ensure your dataset is arranged in a similar manner. # Step 2: Model and Tokenizer Setup We'll use a pre-trained model suitable for Arabic. \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\` is a good choice as it's BERT-based and trained on Arabic. If your task is more aligned with generating questions than answering them, consider a model pre-trained for generative tasks, such as GPT or T5, and look for Arabic versions or models trained on multilingual corpora including Arabic. \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering model_name = 'aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert' tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name) \`\`\` # Step 3: Tokenizing the Dataset Tokenize your pre-processed dataset using the tokenizer. Due to space constraints, this is a simplified overview: \`\`\`python tokenized_samples = tokenizer( [sample['context'] for sample in dataset], [sample['question'] for sample in dataset], truncation=True, padding=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\" ) \`\`\` # Step 4: Training the Model To train the model with PyTorch, you'll need a DataLoader and a training loop. Assuming you have \`tokenized_samples\` and corresponding labels, here's a simplified training loop: \`\`\`python from torch.utils.data import DataLoader from transformers import AdamW train_dataloader = DataLoader(tokenized_samples, batch_size=8) optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) model.train() for epoch in range(3): # For simplicity, let's train for 3 epochs for batch in train_dataloader: # Assuming batch is a dictionary with input_ids, attention_mask, etc. outputs = model(**{k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in batch.items()}) loss = outputs.loss loss.backward() optimizer.step() optimizer.zero_grad() \`\`\` # Step 5: Generating Questions Since our goal includes question generation based on answers, this step requires a model that can generate text. If you have used a model like \`aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert\`, which is fine-tuned for answering questions, you'll need a generative model instead. Here's an illustrative snippet to generate text using GPT-2 (assuming a suitable Arabic version or a setup to handle question generation): \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"gpt_model_name\\") model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\"gpt_model_name\\") input_encoded = tokenizer.encode(\\"Your question prompt here\\", return_tensors=\\"pt\\") output_sequences = model.generate(input_ids=input_encoded) generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True) \`\`\` This example uses placeholders like \`\\"gpt_model_name\\"\` and a simple prompt. You'll need to adjust it according to your specific generative model and ensure the prompt structure guides the model to generate questions based on given answers. # Note: Generating questions from answers is a complex task that may require a custom training setup or leveraging seq2seq models specifically designed for generative tasks. The provided code oversimplifies the process but should give you an initial pathway. For more reliable results, consider training or fine-tuning a seq2seq model like T5 on a dataset structured for question generation."},{"instruction":"using trainer.train","output":"If you're looking to fine-tune a model with Hugging Face's Trainer API, the process is streamlined compared to writing a custom training loop. This guide will demonstrate how to use the \`Trainer\` to fine-tune a model for question generation based on the answer, though this is a slightly unconventional use case for most pre-trained models available in Hugging Face's model repository. Question generation typically requires a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. Thus, let's consider using a T5 model pre-trained on Arabic or multilingual data for this task. # Step 1: Install Hugging Face Transformers Make sure you have the Hugging Face \`transformers\` library installed: \`\`\`bash pip install transformers \`\`\` # Step 2: Prepare the Dataset For simplicity, let's assume you've already preprocessed your dataset into a format that a seq2seq model can understand: a \\"source\\" sentence that the model sees as input (in this case, the answer and possibly some context) and a \\"target\\" sentence that the model should produce (in this case, the question). \`\`\`python from datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict, Dataset # Dummy data for illustration data = { \\"train\\": [ {\\"source\\": \\"The answer is Cairo. <SEP> What is the capital of Egypt?\\", \\"target\\": \\"What is the capital of Egypt?\\"}, ], \\"validation\\": [ {\\"source\\": \\"He is known as Messi. <SEP> Who is considered one of the best football players?\\", \\"target\\": \\"Who is considered one of the best football players?\\"}, ] } train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\\"source\\": [item[\\"source\\"] for item in data[\\"train\\"]], \\"target\\": [item[\\"target\\"] for item in data[\\"train\\"]]}) valid_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\\"source\\": [item[\\"source\\"] for item in data[\\"validation\\"]], \\"target\\": [item[\\"target\\"] for item in data[\\"validation\\"]]}) dataset = DatasetDict({\\"train\\": train_dataset, \\"validation\\": valid_dataset}) \`\`\` # Step 3: Tokenization Tokenize the datasets. T5, a common choice for text-to-text tasks, expects a specific format. \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer model_checkpoint = \\"t5-small\\" # Consider using an Arabic or multilingual variant tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint) # Adjust max_length and padding as needed def preprocess_function(examples): model_inputs = tokenizer(examples[\\"source\\"], max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=\\"max_length\\") with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer(): labels = tokenizer(examples[\\"target\\"], max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=\\"max_length\\") model_inputs[\\"labels\\"] = labels[\\"input_ids\\"] return model_inputs tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True) \`\`\` # Step 4: Load the Model Use a T5 model for sequence-to-sequence tasks. \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint) \`\`\` # Step 5: Initialize the Trainer Set up the Trainer. \`\`\`python from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments training_args = TrainingArguments( output_dir=\\"./results\\", evaluation_strategy=\\"epoch\\", learning_rate=2e-5, per_device_train_batch_size=8, per_device_eval_batch_size=8, num_train_epochs=3, weight_decay=0.01, ) trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"train\\"], eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"validation\\"], tokenizer=tokenizer, ) \`\`\` # Step 6: Train Now, you can train the model. \`\`\`python trainer.train() \`\`\` # Step 7: Generating Questions To generate questions, you can feed answers or context-answers to the model. Here's how you might generate questions for a new piece of text: \`\`\`python text = \\"The answer is Cairo. <SEP>\\" # Add your answer or answer-context here inputs = tokenizer.encode(\\"generate question: \\" + text, return_tensors=\\"pt\\") outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, num_beams=5) print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)) \`\`\` This approach trains a model to generate the questions based on the inputs using a seq2seq model like T5. However, keep in mind that question generation can be challenging, and fine-tuning such models requires careful dataset preparation. Experiment with different model architectures or pre-trained models if the initial results aren't satisfactory."},{"instruction":"Bedava nlp kursu lazim mesela hizli kitap okumak hafizami sifirlamak","output":"Bedava NLP (Nöro-Lingvistik Programlama) kurslarına veya ilgili kaynaklara ulaşmak için birkaç yöntem bulunmaktadır.

A minha jornada começou com uma imersão profunda no setor de hospitalidade, especificamente no Restaurante Vianamar, onde adquiri uma rica variedade de habilidades práticas e gerenciais essenciais para o sucesso em qualquer ambiente de ritmo rápido e orientado para o serviço. Neste papel envolvi-me profundamente com o atendimento ao cliente, comunicação eficaz, gestão de tempo, e a capacidade de trabalhar sob pressão, características fundamentais para a gestão e o crescimento de um negócio. Avançando na minha carreira, tive o privilégio de atuar como assistente administrativo de primeira linha na Manor Houses Lda, em Viana do Castelo, durante um período enriquecedor entre junho de 2002 e dezembro de 2023. Neste cenário internacional, lidando diariamente com a obrigatoriedade de falar inglês, aprimorei não apenas minhas habilidades administrativas, mas também minha fluência em inglês, uma ferramenta crucial que permitiu a comunicação eficaz e a execução de tarefas complexas em um ambiente multicultural. Neste papel desafiador, expandi minha competência em áreas cruciais como gestão de reservas, coordenação de campanhas de AdWords, faturação, e a elaboração e execução de planos de negócios estratégicos, habilmente comunicados em inglês. A fluência nesta língua universal também facilitou a resposta a e-mails para clientes internacionais, além de permitir a condução eficiente de reuniões e a articulação de estimativas financeiras detalhadas num contexto global, atestando minha capacidade de atuar em ambientes empresariais diversificados. Essa experiência singular na Manor Houses Lda não só consolidou minha reputação como um profissional multifacetado e competente, mas também reforçou a importância do inglês como uma ferramenta essencial na gestão empresarial internacional, preparando-me para liderar com confiança em cenários onde a comunicação intercultural é chave. Entre 2019 e 2023, tive a oportunidade única de expandir e especializar minhas habilidades na Conquistas Magnéticas, uma proeminente comercializadora de energia em Portugal, operando no dinâmico e estratégico setor de energia. Neste ambiente inovador, não somente refinei minhas competências em apoio ao cliente, gestão de newsletters e execução de campanhas de e-mail, mas também adquiri conhecimentos fundamentais específicos ao setor energético que enriqueceram a minha base em comunicação e marketing digital. A familiaridade com ferramentas como Excel assumiu um papel crucial nesta fase da minha carreira, pois se tornou instrumental para a realização de análises de dados de consumo energético, padrões de uso e tendências de mercado. Estas análises permitiram-me elaborar relatórios detalhados que apoiavam a tomada de decisões estratégicas, bem como a personalização de comunicações com clientes, oferecendo soluções energéticas customizadas que se alinhavam com suas necessidades e expectativas. Além disso, trabalhando na Conquistas Magnéticas tive a chance de aprofundar meu entendimento sobre regulamentações do setor energético, gestão de contratos de energia, e práticas sustentáveis de consumo. Esse conhecimento especializado foi essencial para o desenvolvimento e implementação de campanhas de email. O domínio dessas valências específicas ao ramo energético potencializou a minha capacidade de gerir projetos e eventos com uma perspectiva integrada de marketing, operações e sustentabilidade. Esta experiência na Conquistas Magnéticas fortaleceu minhas habilidades transversais e proporcionou uma profunda compreensão dos desafios e oportunidades dentro do mercado de energia, preparando-me para liderar com confiança e conhecimento em um setor em constante evolução. A minha diversificada expertise e adaptabilidade foram notavelmente aprimoradas durante minha colaboração com a Gil Enes Unipessoal, uma empresa especializada em eventos e no aluguer de equipamentos profissionais de som, luz e vídeo. Neste papel, não apenas prestei apoio administrativo, mas também apoiei toda a gestão, envolvendo-me integralmente em todos os aspectos e etapas dos projetos em que trabalhamos. Esta experiência permitiu-me desenvolver uma visão holística sobre a gestão de eventos, desde a concepção inicial, passando pelo planeamento e logística, até a execução e análise pós-evento. Além disso, a colaboração com a CMVC, um cliente de destaque que frequentemente solicita a organização de diversos eventos, reforçou ainda mais a minha habilidade de personalizar serviços e soluções para atender às necessidades específicas dos clientes. Esta relação ofereceu valiosas oportunidades para cultivar e aplicar uma gestão de projetos dinâmica e centrada no cliente, garantindo a entrega de eventos memoráveis que excedem as expectativas. A combinação de experiências na Gil Enes Unipessoal e na CMVC, juntamente com a vasta experiência adquirida trabalhando em diversos bares e discotecas, destaca a minha capacidade inerente de navegar com sucesso por diversos contextos e desafios. Desenvolvi uma compreensão profunda da importância de criar experiências envolventes para o público, e refinei minhas habilidades em coordenação de equipe, negociação com fornecedores, e gestão eficiente do tempo, todas essenciais na entrega de eventos excepcionais. Também me habilitei em adaptar rapidamente planos de eventos para atender mudanças de última hora ou imprevistos, garantindo que o resultado não só atenda, mas supere os padrões de excelência. Este conjunto diversificado de experiências equipou-me com competências abrangentes para liderar com eficácia uma empresa no setor administrativo e de apoio a projetos. Destacam-se as habilidades em gestão de documentos e processos, tratamento de e-mails, gestão de encomendas, apoio na organização de eventos e gestão de projetos, preparando-me para navegar com sucesso os desafios e oportunidades do empreendedorismo nesse campo. Com mais de duas décadas de experiência no setor administrativo, tenho uma combinação única de competências práticas e estratégicas moldadas através da gestão em ambientes de pressão elevada e diversidade cultural. Destaca-se, além disso, a experiência direta em setores desafiadores como o energético e o de eventos, proporcionando uma visão 360° sobre a organização eficiente e sustentável. CARACTERIZAÇÃO DA EMPRESA ÁREA DE ATIVIDADE: CAE A atividade principal será classificada sob o Código de Atividades Económicas (CAE) relativa a “82990 - Outras atividades de serviços de apoio prestados às empresas, n.e.”. Esta classificação inclui a gestão de documentos e processos, tratamento de e-mails, gestão de encomendas, organização de eventos, e apoio em gestão de projetos. FORMA JURÍDICA A ADOTAR Sociedade por cotas unipessoal LDA. CAPITAL SOCIAL 10’000.00€ (Dez mil euros). A importância de dispor de um capital social robusto é fundamental no contexto empresarial, especialmente no momento de arranque de um negócio, por diversas razões estratégicas e operacionais. Do ponto de vista operacional, o capital social robusto oferece a liquidez necessária para suportar despesas preliminares, tais como a aquisição de equipamentos, pagamento de licenças, custos com a instalação da sede e despesas iniciais de marketing. Desta forma, a empresa pode arrancar com as suas operações de maneira eficiente, focando-se na geração de receitas em vez de lidar com limitações financeiras. Além disso, um capital social considerável provê uma margem de segurança para a empresa enfrentar imprevistos ou períodos de baixa receita sem comprometer a sua operacionalidade. Isto é particularmente relevante em fases iniciais, onde flutuações nos fluxos de caixa são comuns à medida que o negócio luta por estabelecer a sua posição no mercado. A capacidade da empresa em demonstrar solidez financeira desde o início também facilita a negociação com fornecedores e a contratação de serviços essenciais, podendo inclusive garantir melhores termos de pagamento ou descontos, dado que reduz o risco percebido pelos parceiros. Por fim, no longo prazo, um capital social robusto permite à empresa investir na sua expansão, inovação e no desenvolvimento de novos serviços ou produtos. Isto assegura que a empresa não apenas se mantém competitiva, mas também tem a capacidade de se adaptar e crescer em resposta às mudanças no mercado e às exigências dos clientes. Em resumo, o capital social de 10.000,00€ constitui um pilar essencial para o lançamento e sustentabilidade da empresa, garantindo uma fundação financeira estável que apoia as operações iniciais, fortalece a credibilidade e contribui para uma trajetória de crescimento e sucesso no mercado. SEDE Rua do Pico 175, Areosa. 4900-870 Viana do Castelo. LOCAL ONDE SERÁ EXERCIDA A ATIVIDADE A atividade será inicialmente conduzida na sede em Viana do Castelo, com potencial para expandir para outras áreas ou oferecer serviços remotamente a nível nacional e internacional. O PORQUÊ DO DESENVOLVIMENTO DA ATIVIDADE A dinâmica atual do mercado exige que pequenas e médias empresas (PMEs) e startups otimizem os seus recursos, procurando soluções ágeis que permitam concentrar-se nas suas actividades centrais (core business) sem comprometer a qualidade e eficiência dos serviços de apoio. Nesse contexto, a terceirização de serviços administrativos emerge como um recurso estratégico, proporcionando uma notável economia em custos diretos e indiretos. Ao optar pelo outsourcing, estas empresas conseguem reduzir significativamente despesas com salários, encargos sociais, impostos e custos associados à formação e ao treino da equipa interna. Além da poupança financeira, o outsourcing proporciona acesso imediato a um leque mais amplo de competências profissionais especializadas, sem a necessidade de compromissos a longo prazo. Esta flexibilidade permite às PMEs e startups ajustarem-se com mais agilidade às variações do mercado e fortalecerem a sua posição competitiva. O serviço de apoio administrativo que ofereço, permite aos meus clientes não apenas maximizar a economia de recursos, mas também proporcionar uma solução integrada que, aliada à eficiência operacional, oferece um equilibrado custo-benefício. Esta abordagem de serviços especializados destaca-se pela sua capacidade de alinhamento com as necessidades específicas dos clientes. MAIS VALIAS DO PROMOTOR A minha trajetória diversificada abrangendo gestão administrativa, eventos, e o setor de energia, aliada à competência em inglês e a habilidades analíticas avançadas, constituem um conjunto único de mais valias. Esta fundação permite-me oferecer serviços diferenciados, inovadores e de alto valor agregado. ÁREA GEOGRÁFICA DE INTERVENÇÃO DA ATIVIDADE Inicialmente, o foco será em Viana do Castelo e áreas adjacentes, com planos de expansão para o mercado nacional em fases subsequentes, aproveitando o potencial de serviços remotos para alcançar um mercado internacional.

DESCRIÇÃO DO NEGÓCIO CONCEITO O conceito do negócio centra-se na prestação de serviços de apoio administrativo especializado às pequenas e médias empresas (PMEs) e startups, O objetivo é permitir que estas empresas otimizem os seus recursos, focando-se nas atividades centrais sem comprometer a qualidade e eficiência dos serviços de apoio. A proposta inclui gestão de documentos e processos, tratamento de e-mails, gestão de encomendas, organização de eventos, e apoio em gestão de projetos, proporcionando uma notável economia em custos diretos e indiretos e acesso a um leque mais amplo de competências profissionais especializadas. ESTRATÉGIAS A estratégia de implementação baseia-se numa abordagem multifacetada que inclui o desenvolvimento de uma sólida presença digital, robusto networking profissional, e parcerias estratégicas com outras empresas e fornecedores de serviços. A empresa utilizará ferramentas tecnológicas avançadas e adotará práticas sustentáveis para se posicionar como uma opção contemporânea e ética no mercado. O modelo operacional prevê a valorização dos insights setoriais do promotor para antecipar tendências e adaptar-se proactivamente às mudanças do mercado, visando estabelecer a empresa como líder no fornecimento de serviços administrativos especializados. OBJECTIVOS - Curto prazo: Estabelecer a empresa como um parceiro confiável para PMEs e startups em Viana do Castelo e regiões limítrofes, atingindo um segmento de mercado potencial estimado em aproximadamente 2.500 empresas. - Médio prazo: Consolidar a presença no mercado regional, oferecendo soluções personalizadas que ultrapassem os desafios administrativos enfrentados pelo mercado-alvo, visando uma expansão para o mercado nacional através de serviços remotos. - Longo prazo: Expandir a oferta de serviços em nível internacional, capitalizando sobre o potencial crescente da terceirização remota de processos administrativos e posicionando a empresa como um player importante no mercado global de serviços administrativos externalizados. Através da implementação destas estratégias e o alcance destes objetivos, o projeto almeja fornecer uma solução integrada que combine eficiência operacional com um custo-benefício equilibrado. Este conceito de negócio, apoiado por um promotor com competências e experiência robustas, está preparado para atender às necessidades de um mercado dinâmico e em expansão. MERCADO ALVO O mercado-alvo principal são as pequenas e médias empresas (PME) e startups, com uma faturação anual até 3 milhões de euros e equipas até 50 colaboradores. Estas empresas ambicionam otimizar recursos e focalizar-se no seu negócio principal, externalizando serviços administrativos especializados que permitam a redução de custos operacionais e proporcionem acesso a competências qualificadas sem obrigações de longa duração. Inicialmente, o foco incidirá sobre as PME e startups dos sectores tecnológico, de serviços profissionais, consultoria e comércio, situadas em Viana do Castelo e regiões limítrofes. Estima-se que exista um mercado potencial de aproximadamente 2.500 empresas que correspondem a este perfil na área de atuação inicial (Fonte: Censo Empresarial de Viana do Castelo, Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2020). Este segmento de clientes enfrenta habitualmente desafios como a sobrecarga da equipa interna com tarefas administrativas de rotina (gestão documental, faturação, contabilidade básica), a dificuldade em contratar e reter talento administrativo qualificado, e a necessidade de apoio específico para projetos e eventos particulares (Fonte: “Desafios Administrativos de PME”, Revista Portuguesa de Gestão, 2019). A nossa proposta apresenta uma solução abrangente que não só ultrapassa esses impedimentos através de serviços administrativos externalizados e especializados, mas também promove um aumento da eficiência operacional geral, oferecendo uma relação custo-benefício excepcional. Este valor é potenciado pelos atributos competitivos distintivos do promotor, que se traduzem em vantagens como o incremento da produtividade, apoio linguístico melhorado e soluções personalizadas em conformidade com as tendências de inovação, proporcionando valor acrescentado aos clientes além da poupança de custos (Fonte: Relatório “Benefícios da Externalização de Serviços Administrativos”, Associação Portuguesa de Empresas de Serviços Partilhados, 2022). Após a consolidação no mercado regional, a estratégia antevê a expansão para a oferta de serviços remotos a nível nacional e, numa fase posterior, internacional, capitalizando o potencial crescente da terceirização remota de processos administrativos (Fonte: Estudo “Tendências Globais de Externalização de Serviços Administrativos”, Consultoria XYZ, 2021). Tendências como a digitalização, o destaque na eficiência operacional e a externalização estratégica de atividades não essenciais sublinham as perspectivas de uma procura contínua e crescente por soluções como a nossa, que está posicionada para satisfazer e exceder as necessidades deste mercado-alvo apelativo e em ampliação (Fonte: Relatório “Futuro do Trabalho Administrativo”, Organização Internacional do Trabalho, 2020). Para uma análise aprofundada do mercado-alvo, segmentaremos as PMEs e startups com base no seu setor de atividade, volume de negócios, e necessidades específicas de apoio administrativo. A tendência crescente para a digitalização das operações destaca uma oportunidade particular para serviços especializados nesta área, assim como a gestão de eventos e projetos, onde a nossa oferta se pode diferenciar. Dados do Instituto Nacional de Estatística indicam que, em Viana do Castelo, aproximadamente 70% das empresas enquadram-se no perfil definido como nosso mercado-alvo, evidenciando um potencial significativo para a penetração e expansão de mercado. A análise competitiva revela que, embora existam prestadores de serviços similares, poucos oferecem um pacote integrado e personalizado como o nosso, posicionando-nos de forma vantajosa para captar este segmento. ESTRATÉGIAS PARA CONQUISTAR O MERCADO ALVO A estratégia de implementação do projeto será estruturada em fases definidas, começando com o estabelecimento da infraestrutura básica e o lançamento de uma campanha de marketing digital nos primeiros 3 meses. Até ao sexto mês, focar-nos-emos na consolidação da nossa base de clientes em Viana do Castelo, utilizando uma abordagem direta e parcerias estratégicas locais. A partir daí, expandiremos progressivamente os serviços para o mercado nacional. A estrutura organizacional será ágil, inicialmente centrada no promotor, mas com planos de recrutar dois assistentes administrativos dentro de dois/três anos, conforme o crescimento dos negócios. Para o desenvolvimento desta atividade assenta numa abordagem multifacetada, que visa não apenas estabelecer uma sólida presença digital e desenvolver um robusto networking profissional, mas também firmar parcerias estratégicas com outras empresas e fornecedores de serviços. Este modelo operacional será fundamentado na adoção de ferramentas tecnológicas avançadas e na incorporação de práticas sustentáveis, ressaltando o compromisso da empresa com a responsabilidade social e ambiental. Tal posicionamento almeja destacar a empresa no mercado como uma opção contemporânea e ética, alinhada com os valores de potenciais clientes e parceiros que priorizam a sustentabilidade e a inovação. A experiência prévia do promotor, que inclui ampla competência em gestão administrativa e apoio a projetos, bem como especialização em áreas críticas como gestão de eventos e consultoria em gestão energética, representa um pilar fundamental para a concretização desta estratégia. Estes conhecimentos e habilidades, aliados a uma proficiência comprovada em comunicação interpessoal e negociação, oferecem uma base sólida para a implementação de soluções personalizadas que atendam às necessidades específicas de cada cliente. Adicionalmente, a capacidade de liderança e gestão de equipes multidisciplinares, adquirida ao longo dos anos em diversos contextos profissionais, será crucial para garantir a eficácia operacional e a satisfação do cliente. A estratégia contempla ainda a valorização dos insights adquiridos em diferentes sectores de atividade, o que permite antecipar tendências e adaptar-se proactivamente às mudanças do mercado. Este aspeto é particularmente relevante num contexto empresarial dinâmico, onde a capacidade de resposta rápida e inovadora pode significar a diferença entre o sucesso e a estagnação. Deste modo, a implementação da atividade será dinamizada através da combinação estratégica de tecnologia, sustentabilidade e experiência, visando não só atrair uma clientela diversificada, mas também estabelecer a empresa como líder no fornecimento de serviços administrativos e de apoio a projetos. A atenção ao detalhe, a personalização do serviço e a constante busca por excelência serão os alicerces desta abordagem, garantindo assim que a empresa não apenas atenda, mas exceda as expectativas dos seus clientes. Para garantir a sustentabilidade e competitividade a longo prazo, a empresa compromete-se com a inovação contínua dos seus serviços e processos. Isto inclui o investimento em formação para manter a equipa ao corrente das últimas tendências tecnológicas e de gestão, bem como o desenvolvimento de novas ofertas de serviços baseadas na análise de necessidades emergentes do mercado. Planos de expansão futura incluem a diversificação para novos setores, como o aluguer de audiovisuais, e a exploração de modelos de negócios disruptivos, tais como plataformas de intermediação de serviços administrativos, aumentando a nossa área de atuação e valor acrescentado para os clientes. Assim, encaramos esta jornada com confiança, fundamentada numa estratégia de implementação coerente e um promotor com as competências e a experiência necessárias para transformar visão em realidade. PRINCIPAIS CONCORRENTES? Através de uma pesquisa detalhada no Google, rastreamos entidades como a Notável & Coerente Unipessoal Lda, ADECCO, RANDSTAD e CoworkElisabete Ribeiro Contabilidade, entre muitas outras. No entanto, as entidades não constituem concorrentes especializados diretos em todos os aspetos, já que há uma lacuna de mercado que pretendemos preencher com o lançamento do empreendimento, assim, proporcionando uma vantagem competitiva clara em termos da prestação de serviços integrados. ANALISE SWOT Pontos Fortes: - Experiência vasta e diversificada do promotor, cobrindo diferentes setores como hospitalidade, assistência administrativa, comercialização de energia, e gestão de eventos, que proporcionam uma base sólida de habilidades e conhecimentos. - A utilização de um capital social robusto de 10’000.00€, assegurando uma launch pad sólida para as operações iniciais e para enfrentar os imprevistos com flexibilidade. - Capacidade do promotor em fornecer serviços num contexto multicultural e em inglês, ampliando o mercado alvo potencial para além das fronteiras nacionais. - Estratégia de operação bem definida que inclui digitalização, sustentabilidade e parcerias estratégicas, posicionando a empresa como uma opção contemporânea e ética no mercado. - Foco inicial em PMEs e startups, um segmento de mercado que demonstra uma forte procura por terceirização de serviços administrativos para otimização de recursos. Pontos Fracos: - Dependência inicial elevada no promotor para a operacionalização e gestão do negócio pode apresentar riscos de sustentabilidade a longo prazo se não forem implementadas estratégias de delegação e recrutamento eficazes. - A proposta de valor é baseada na externalização de serviços, o que pode encontrar resistência por parte de empresas mais tradicionais que preferem manter estas funções internamente. - Restrição inicial geográfica a Viana do Castelo pode limitar a captura de mercado no curto prazo até a expansão nacional ser efetivada. Oportunidades: - Crescimento da tendência de digitalização e externalização de serviços não essenciais, especialmente no contexto pós-pandemia, que aumenta a procura por tais serviços. - Potencial de expansão para o mercado nacional e internacional, através do desenvolvimento de serviços remotos. - Capacidade de desenvolvimento de novos serviços e modelos de negócios disruptivos, como plataformas de intermediação de serviços administrativos, adequando-se às necessidades emergentes do mercado. Ameaças: - Concorrência de empresas já estabelecidas que oferecem serviços similares, requerendo um esforço de diferenciação e criação de valor adicionado. - Mudanças regulatórias no setor de serviços que podem impactar operações ou aumentar o custo de compliance. - Vulnerabilidade a crises econômicas ou setoriais, que podem impactar a capacidade das PMEs e startups em investir em serviços de apoio administrativo.

Először készítsük el a \`Csavarfej\` felsorolást, ami meghatározza a csavarhúzók lehetséges fejtípusait, mint például EGYHORNYU, PHILLIPS, IMBUSZ: \`\`\`java public enum Csavarfej { EGYHORNYU, PHILLIPS, IMBUSZ } \`\`\` Most készítsük el a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályt. Ebben az osztályban van egy adattag a mérethez (\`meret\`) és egy a csavarfejhez (\`fej\`), amely a \`Csavarfej\` típusú. A konstruktornak ezeket az értékeket be kell állítania az objektum létrehozásakor. Ezen kívül implementálnunk kell a lekérdező függvényeket (\`getMeret()\`, \`getCsavarFej()\`) és egy \`toString()\` metódust is, amely szöveges formában reprezentálja az objektumot: \`\`\`java public class Csavarhuzo { private int meret; private Csavarfej fej; public Csavarhuzo(int meret, Csavarfej fej) { this.meret = meret; this.fej = fej; } public int getMeret() { return meret; } public Csavarfej getCsavarFej() { return fej; } @Override public String toString() { return \\"Csavarhuzo{\\" + \\"meret=\\" + meret + \\", fej=\\" + fej + '}'; } } \`\`\` Ebben az implementációban a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztály tartalmazza a specifikált adattagokat és metódusokat. A \`toString()\` metódus egyszerűen visszaad egy sztringet, amely információt nyújt a csavarhúzóról (mérete és feje típusa). Ez az osztály és az enum együtt kiszolgálja az UML diagram alapján definiált követelményeket, biztosítva, hogy a \`Csavarhuzo\` objektumok mérete és feje könnyedén beállítható, lekérdezhető és szöveges formában reprezentálható legyen."},{"instruction":"És ez a sor elengedhetetlen?

A nyílra az van írva, hogy \\"# csavarfej\\".","output":"Az UML ábrában a \`private Csavarfej fej;\` adattag valóban nem szerepel explicit módon, de az asszociáció a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztály és a \`Csavarfej\` enumeráció között jelzi, hogy a két osztály között kapcsolat van. Amikor az UML diagramon egy osztályból nyíl mutat egy másikra, az általában asszociációt jelez, azaz valamilyen kapcsolatot vagy kölcsönhatást a két elem között. Itt a \\"# csavarfej\\" megjegyzés arra utal, hogy a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztálynak van egy \`csavarfej\` típusú referenciaadattagja, ami a \`Csavarfej\` típust használja. Azért, hogy elérjük ezt a kapcsolatot (vagy asszociációt) a valós kódunkban, szükségünk van arra, hogy bevezessünk egy adattagot a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályon belül, ami tárol egy \`Csavarfej\` típusú értéket. Ez történik a \`private Csavarfej fej;\` sor esetében. Ennek az adattagnak a bevezetése nem egyszerűen egy implementációs döntés, hanem közvetlenül leköveti az UML diagramon látható kapcsolatot. Az, hogy \\"A Csavarhuzo és Csavarfej közötti asszociáció az ábráról is leolvashatóan adattag formájában valósul meg.\\" kifejezés azt jelenti, hogy a Csavarhuzo osztály és a Csavarfej enumeráció közötti kapcsolat egy konkrét adattagban (ebben az esetben a \`fej\` adattagban) ölt testet. Az adattag formájában való megvalósulás biztosítja, hogy minden egyes \`Csavarhuzo\` objektum társítható legyen egy adott \`Csavarfej\` értékkel, azaz minden csavarhúzónak lesz egy feje, amit az enumeráció definiál. Röviden: A diagramból és a követelményekből adódóan készítjük el a kódot úgy, hogy a modellezett kapcsolat implementálásra kerüljön az adattagokon keresztül.

Konkrétan, ez azt jelenti, hogy a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztály egy leszármazottja vagy al osztálya a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztálynak. Ez azt jelenti, hogy a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` örökli a \`Csavarhuzo\` összes publikus és védett (protected) adattagját és metódusát, így a már definiált viselkedésre építhetünk tovább, specifikusabb funkcionalitást adva az új osztálynak, amely a cserelehetőséget kezeli. Java kódban az öröklődés úgy valósítható meg, hogy az osztálydeklarációban az \\"extends\\" kulcsszót követően megadjuk a szülőosztály nevét. Például: \`\`\`java public class CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo extends Csavarhuzo { // Adattagok private int fejMeret; private boolean egyhornyuFej; private boolean phillipsFej; private boolean imbuszFej; // Konstruktor public CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo(int meret, int fejMeret, Csavarfej csavarFej) { super(meret, csavarFej); // Szülőosztály konstruktorának meghívása this.fejMeret = fejMeret; // Példányosításkor alapértelmezés szerint csak a konstruktorban megadott csavarfej // típusa lesz elérhető. További logika szükséges az egyes csavarfej típusok kezelésére. } // További metódusok, például a fejcsere logikájának implementációja public void fejElhagy(String melyik) { // Implementáció } public boolean fejCsere(String melyikre) { // Implementáció return true; // vagy false, a logikától függően } // Esetleg további metódusok és logika } \`\`\` Ebben a példában a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztály \\"extends\\" kulcsszóval kiterjeszti a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályt, így örökölve annak minden nem privát adattagját és metódusát. Egyedi adattagok és/vagy metódusok hozzáadásával bővíthetjük a leszármazott osztály funckionalitását, például itt hozzáadjuk a fejcsere logikát és az ahhoz szükséges adattagokat. Figyelembe kell venni, hogy ha a szülőosztálynak nincsen paraméter nélküli konstruktora (például mivel csak olyan konstruktorokat definiáltunk, amelyek paramétereket igényelnek), akkor a leszármazott osztálynak a konstruktorában explicit módon meg kell hívnia a szülőosztály egyik konstruktorát a \`super\` kulcsszó segítségével, ahogy a példa is mutatja."},{"instruction":"Oké, de ez miért jobb, mintha csak simán létre kellene hoznom a \\"CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\\" osztályt, és megmondani (hivatkozni egy adattagra), hogy public class CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo { //ha szuksegunk van a toString metodusra miert nem csak egy meghivjuk?

Nézzük meg ezeket az előnyöket: 1. **Kódújrafelhasználás**: Az öröklődés lehetővé teszi, hogy újrahasználjuk a szülőosztály metódusait és adattagjait a leszármazott osztályban anélkül, hogy újra kellene őket írnunk. Tehát ami már a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályban meg van valósítva (pl. \`getMeret()\`, \`getCsavarFej()\`, \`toString()\`), az automatikusan része lesz a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztálynak is. 2. **Polimorfizmus**: A leszármazott osztályt kezelhetjük mint a szülőosztály egy példányát is. Ez lehetővé teszi többek között, hogy különböző típusú objektumokat ugyanazon az interfészen keresztül kezeljük, aminek köszönhetően rugalmasabbá és könnyebben bővíthetővé válik a kód. 3. **Felülírás**: Meg tudjuk változtatni (felül tudjuk írni) a szülőosztály bizonyos metódusainak viselkedését saját, specifikus implementációval a leszármazott osztályban. Például a \`toString()\` metódus felülírásával adhatunk vissza részletesebb információt a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` objektumokról. Az \\"implements\\"-sel szemben, ami azt jelenti, hogy egy osztály megvalósít egy vagy több interfészt, az \\"extends\\" kulcsszót öröklődésre használjuk. Az interfész egy olyan szerződés, amit az osztályoknak teljesíteniük kell. Egy interfész csak metódusdeklarációkat tartalmaz (Java 8 előtt szigorúan csak azokat, Java 8-től kezdődően default metódusokat és statikus metódusokat is tartalmazhatnak), és nem tartalmaz implementációkat az osztályoknak meg kell valósítania (\`implement\`) az összes abban deklarált metódust. Tehát míg az \\"extends\\" egy létező osztály kiterjesztése, addig az \\"implements\\" egy szerződés megvalósítása. Mindkettő a kód újrafelhasználását és rugalmasságát célozza, de különböző eszközökkel és különböző helyzetekben."},{"instruction":"Cserélhető fejű csavarhúzó A cserélhető fejű csavarhúzókhoz alapvetően jár mindhárom fejtípus (ám ezeket el is hagyhat- juk),melyeketaegyhornyuFej, phillipsFej, imbuszFejreprezentál(aváltozóigaz, ha az adott fej még rendelkezésre áll, hamis, ha már elhagytuk).

Amikor egy osztály egy másik osztálytól örököl (\`extends\` használata Java nyelvben), akkor az al osztály (gyermek osztály) képes hozzáférni a szülő osztály (szuper osztály) adattagjaihoz és metódusaihoz. A \`super\` kulcsszó különleges szerepet tölt be ebben az öröklődési viszonyban: lehetővé teszi a gyermek osztály számára, hogy hívja a szülő osztályának konstruktorait, metódusait, illetve hozzáférjen az adott adattagjaihoz (amennyiben azok elérhetőek az adott kontextusban). A \`super(meret, csavarFej);\` sor, amelyet a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztály konstruktorában találunk, a szülő osztály, vagyis a \`Csavarhuzo\` konstruktorának hívása.

Ez a hívás kötelező, mert a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályban a két paraméteres konstruktor eltárolja és beállítja ezeket az értékeket a \`Csavarhuzo\` objektum létrehozásakor. Mivel a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztály a \`Csavarhuzo\`-ból örököl, szükség van a szülő osztály állapotának megfelelő inicializálására is, ami itt a méret és a csavarfej adattagok beállítását foglalja magában.

Metódusok A kért getterek és szetterek az elvárásuknak megfelelően működjenek! A toString metódus térjen vissza egy szöveggel, az alábbiak szerint: • Amennyiben egyhornyú a csavarfej, térjen vissza a \\"hagyomanyos feju csavarhuzo\\" szö- veggel. • Amennyiben phillips fejű a csavarhúzó, térjen vissza a \\"csillagfeju csavarhuzo\\" szöveggel. • Amennyiben imbusz fejű a csavarhúzó, térjen vissza a \\"imbuszfeju csavarhuzo\\" szöveggel.

Definiáld felül a getMeret metódust. Mivel a csavarfej cserélhető, ezért annak mérete nem számít bele a csavarhúzó méretébe. Ennek megfelelően működjön a méretet visszaadó függvény. A konstruktorban érkező méret a csavarhúzó teljes mérete.","output":"Figyelembe véve a feladat részletes leírását, láthatjuk, hogy valóban van némi zavar az \\"implements\\" és \\"extends\\" használatában, és a \`setCsavarFej()\` funkciónak való hivatkozás kapcsán. Ha nem lehet közvetlenül a \`setCsavarFej()\` metódust használni a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályban a \`fej\` adattag beállítására - mivel ez nem része az eredeti leírásnak -, ebben az esetben a megközelítésnek máshogy kell történnie. Tekintettel arra, hogy a szülő osztályban (\`Csavarhuzo\`) nincs említve a setter metódus, és örököljük a \`fej\` adattagot valamilyen formában a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztályba - az öröklés alapján - az új fej cseréje az öröklődés és a polimorfizmus segítségével történhet. Ezt elérhetjük például úgy, hogy felüldefiniáljuk a \`getCsavarFej()\` metódust, és így minden csavarfej-csere esetén újrainicializáljuk a \`Csavarhuzo\` objektumot az új fejparaméterrel, ha ez szükséges. Tekintsünk egy lehetséges megközelítést a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztály számára a zavar elkerülése érdekében, ami megfelel az UML diagram és a feladat leírásának: \`\`\`java public class CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo extends Csavarhuzo { private boolean egyhornyuFej = true; private boolean phillipsFej = true; private boolean imbuszFej = true; public CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo(int meret, Csavarfej csavarFej) { super(meret, csavarFej); } public boolean fejCsere(String melyikre) { boolean fejRendelkezesreAll = false; switch (melyikre.toLowerCase()) { case \\"egyhornyu\\": fejRendelkezesreAll = egyhornyuFej; break; case \\"phillips\\": fejRendelkezesreAll = phillipsFej; break; case \\"imbusz\\": fejRendelkezesreAll = imbuszFej; break; } if (!fejRendelkezesreAll || getCsavarFej().toString().toLowerCase().equals(melyikre)) { return false; } // Ha az új fej rendelkezésre áll, és nem egyezik a jelenlegivel, akkor létrehozunk egy új Csavarhuzo objektumot ezzel a fejjel // Figyelem: Ez csak egy illusztratív példa. A Csavarhuzo osztályban nem valósítható meg így közvetlenül, mivel szükséges lenne a fej adattag beállítását lehetővé tevő mechanizmus. Csavarfej ujFej = Csavarfej.valueOf(melyikre.toUpperCase()); super.setCsavarFej(ujFej); // feltételezve, hogy van ilyen metódus, ami valójában nem része a feladatnak return true; } // További metódusok implementálása szükséges private void fejElhagy(String melyik) { switch(melyik.toLowerCase()) { case \\"egyhornyu\\": egyhornyuFej = false; break; case \\"phillips\\": phillipsFej = false; break; case \\"imbusz\\": imbuszFej = false; break; } } } \`\`\` Fontos kiemelni, hogy a fenti kódpélda egy lehetséges megközelítést mutat be, amely azonban elfogadja a \`setCsavarFej(ujFej);\` hívást, ami a kérdés alapján nem tűnik lehetségesnek, mivel nincs felvázolva az UML diagramban. Valójában, ha a \`Csavarhuzo\` konstruktorát kell használnunk fej cseréjéhez, akkor az új \`Csavarhuzo\` példányosítása, vagy a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztály módosítása érdekében szükséges egy belső logika az osztályban, ami lehetővé teszi a csavarfej cseréjét, ami nem része a feladathoz definiált specifikációknak. A feladat úgy tűnik, több információt vagy részletesebb magyarázatot igényel ahhoz, hogy tisztázni lehessen, hogyan kívánták a fej cseréjének mechanizmusát pontosan implementálni."},{"instruction":"Qu'est ce que le changement climatique ? Et Ses conséquences","output":"Le changement climatique est un phénomène mondial caractérisé par une augmentation des températures moyennes de la Terre, causée principalement par les activités humaines générant des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Ces gaz retiennent la chaleur dans l'atmosphère, provoquant un réchauffement progressif de la planète. Les conséquences du changement climatique sont multiples et peuvent avoir des impacts graves sur l'environnement, l'économie et la société. Parmi ces conséquences, on peut citer : - Augmentation des températures : cela peut entraîner des vagues de chaleur plus fréquentes et intenses, menaçant la santé des populations et la sécurité alimentaire. - Fonte des glaciers et des calottes glaciaires : cela conduit à une élévation du niveau des mers, menaçant les populations côtières et les écosystèmes marins. - Changements dans les régimes de précipitations : les phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes, tels que les tempêtes, les inondations et les sécheresses, deviennent plus fréquents et intenses, affectant l'agriculture et la sécurité alimentaire. - Perturbation des écosystèmes : le déplacement des espèces et la disparition de certains habitats causent une perte de biodiversité et fragilisent les écosystèmes. - Augmentation de la fréquence des maladies : le changement climatique favorise la propagation de maladies infectieuses, telles que le paludisme et la dengue, qui peuvent toucher de plus en plus de populations. En résumé, le changement climatique est un enjeu majeur qui nécessite une action concertée à l'échelle mondiale pour limiter ses impacts néfastes sur notre planète et ses habitants."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

New sports or variations of existing games emerge from time to time, often blending elements from multiple disciplines. 2. **A fictional or virtual game:** The name \\"Blade Ball\\" sounds like it could be a sport or game from a video game, movie, book, or another form of entertainment media. These fictional competitions often feature unique rules and elements that combine aspects of existing sports with imaginative or futuristic twists. 3. **A nickname or alternate name for a sport:** Sometimes, existing sports or games are given nicknames or colloquial names that reflect a notable aspect of the game. If \\"Blade Ball\\" is an alternate name, it might be related to a sport involving blades (like skates, as in ice hockey or roller hockey) or something that involves a cutting or slicing motion (perhaps in a racket or bat sport). 4. **A misinterpretation or misspelling:** There's also the possibility that \\"Blade Ball\\" is a misinterpretation, misspelling, or incorrect rendering of a sport or game's name. Without more specific context, it's challenging to provide a detailed explanation of what \\"Blade Ball\\" could be.

It was founded by Allan Pinkerton in 1850 and is known as one of the oldest detective agencies in the country. The Pinkertons gained fame and notoriety for their involvement in a variety of activities throughout American history, from tracking down outlaws in the Wild West to breaking strikes and infiltrating labor unions for businesses. In the mid-19th century, the Pinkertons were instrumental in pursuing and capturing a number of well-known criminals and outlaws, including bank and train robbers. The agency's logo, an eye accompanied by the motto \\"We Never Sleep,\\" symbolized their commitment to vigilance and is considered to be the origin of the term \\"private eye\\" as a reference to private investigators. The Pinkerton Agency also played controversial roles during labor conflicts at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. They were often hired by large corporations and industrialists to infiltrate unions, suppress strikes, and protect company property from labor actions, which in some cases led to violent confrontations. Despite their controversial past, the Pinkerton Agency has continued to operate into the 21st century, now as part of Securitas AB, a Swedish security company, focusing on security services and consultations rather than detective work. The legacy of the Pinkertons is multifaceted, as they are both recognized for pioneering methods in criminal investigation and criticized for their role in suppressing labor movements."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Konstruktor • Három paramétert váró konstruktor: várja a csavarhúzó méretét (a fejjel együtt), a cse- rélhető fej méretét, valamint egy csavarfejet, ezeket az azonos nevű adattagok értékének állítsd be.

Arra nem kell felkészülni, hogy olyan csavarfejet hagyunk el, ami éppen a csavarhúzón található, ez a valóságban sem fordul elő. Az fejCsere metódus működése: paraméterben kapunk egy szöveget (amely az alábbiak egyike: \\"egyhornyu\\", \\"phillips\\", \\"imbusz\\"), majd a beérkező szöveg alapján cseréljük le a fejet. Amire mindenképpen figyelni kell: • Amennyiben a jelenlegi és az új fej megegyezik, ne történjen semmi, térjünk vissza ha- missal. • Amennyiben a beállítani kívánt fejet már elhagytuk (az ezt reprezentáló logikai változó hamis), ne történjen semmi, térjünk vissza hamissal. • Amennyiben a jelenlegi fej nem egyezik meg az új fejjel, és az új fej rendelkezésre áll, cseréljük le azt (az örökölt csavarfej adattag beállításával). Definiáld felül a getMeret metódust. Mivel a csavarfej cserélhető, ezért annak mérete nem számít bele a csavarhúzó méretébe. Ennek megfelelően működjön a méretet visszaadó függvény.

Első probléma, hogy a \`getCsavarfej().equals\` használata helytelen, mert a \`getCsavarfej()\` egy \`Csavarfej\` típusú értéket ad vissza, nem String-et. Emellett a fej cseréjét az adott osztályban (\`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\`) nem lehet közvetlenül változtatni, mivel az \`fej\` attribútum a szülőosztályban (\`Csavarhuzo\`) privát. Másodszor, a \`getMeret()\` metódus a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztály méretét adja vissza, és mivel örökölted a \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályt, nem szükséges újraimplementálni ezt a metódust, hacsak nem kell módosítani az eredeti viselkedésen. Mivel azonban a feladat azt kérte, hogy mivel a csavarfej cserélhető, a fej méreteit ne vegye figyelembe, így itt nem áll fenn szükség módosításra, mivel a feladat nem specifikálja, hogy a \`fejMeret\` miként befolyásolná a csavarhúzó méretét, csak azt adja meg, hogy ez a méret nem számít bele. Helyesítsük ki a \`fejCsere\` metódust és hagyjuk el a \`getMeret()\`-t (mivel nem kell módosítani annak logikáját), íme egy javított kódrészlet: \`\`\`java public boolean fejCsere(String melyikre) { Csavarfej jelenlegiFej = getCsavarfej(); boolean csereSikeres = true; switch (melyikre) { case \\"egyhornyu\\": csereSikeres = egyhornyuFej && jelenlegiFej != Csavarfej.EGYHORNYU; if (csereSikeres) fej = Csavarfej.EGYHORNYU; break; case \\"phillips\\": csereSikeres = phillipsFej && jelenlegiFej != Csavarfej.PHILLIPS; if (csereSikeres) fej = Csavarfej.PHILLIPS; break; case \\"imbusz\\": csereSikeres = imbuszFej && jelenlegiFej != Csavarfej.IMBUSZ; if (csereSikeres) fej = Csavarfej.IMBUSZ; break; default: csereSikeres = false; } return csereSikeres; } \`\`\` Megjegyzendő: A fenti kód tartalmaz egy kísérletet a fej cseréjére, mégis hiba van benne, mert az alaposztály (\`Csavarhuzo\`) privát \`fej\` tagja nem módosítható közvetlenül az alosztályból (\`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\`). Ehhez szükséges egy módszer az alaposztályban, ami lehetővé teszi a csavarfej cseréjét, vagy a \`fej\` attribútumot \`protected\`-dé kell tenni, hogy az alosztályból hozzáférhető és módosítható legyen, de utóbbi gyakorlat nem ajánlott objektum-orientált tervezési szempontból. A \`Csavarhuzo\` osztályban vegyél fel egy új metódust a csavarfej beállítására: \`\`\`java protected void setCsavarfej(Csavarfej fej) { this.fej = fej; } \`\`\` Ezzel már módosítható lesz a csavarfej a \`CserelhetoFejuCsavarhuzo\` osztályban, a \`setCsavarfej\` használatával a \`fejCsere\` metóduson belül."},{"instruction":"acute tubular necrosis results in gue and what casts to find?","output":"Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) primarily results in the presence of \\"muddy brown\\" casts in the urine. These casts are formed due to the sloughing of injured tubular epithelial cells into the tubular lumen. In addition to the muddy brown casts, you may also find renal tubular epithelial cells or granular casts in the urine sediment.

Notez que la demande d'un minimum d'une page complète pour chaque description et d'images ne peut être intégralement satisfaite ici, mais je peux vous donner un aperçu utile. **D) Murs Métalliques** 1. **Aluminium** - **Description** : L'aluminium est léger, durable et résiste à la corrosion. Il est souvent utilisé dans la construction moderne pour les facades et les murs métalliques. Sa flexibilité et sa facilité de manipulation permettent des designs innovants. - **Mise en oeuvre** : L'aluminium est généralement installé sous forme de panneaux ou de lames, fixés à la structure de support à l'aide de clips ou de cadres métalliques. Les joints peuvent être scellés pour améliorer l'étanchéité. 2. **Alucobond** - **Description** : Alucobond est une marque spécifique de panneaux composites en aluminium, constitués de deux feuilles d'aluminium autour d'un noyau en polyéthylène. Ces panneaux sont prisés pour leur légèreté, leur durabilité et leur grande variété de finitions. - **Mise en oeuvre** : L'installation des panneaux Alucobond nécessite des systèmes de fixation spécialisés qui permettent une dilatation thermique adéquate. Les panneaux sont souvent fixés sur une ossature métallique préalablement installée sur le bâtiment. 3. **Acier Prélaqué** - **Description** : L'acier prélaqué est un acier qui a été revêtu d'une couche de peinture ou de film protecteur avant d'être formé en panneaux ou en autres éléments de construction. Il est apprécié pour sa résistance et sa vaste gamme de couleurs. - **Mise en oeuvre** : Ce type d'acier est souvent utilisé pour les murs métalliques sous forme de panneaux qui sont ensuite fixés à la structure principale. Les détails d'installation comprennent l'étanchéité aux jonctions et parfois l'isolation derrière les panneaux. 4. **Cuivre** - **Description** : Le cuivre est un matériel traditionnellement utilisé pour son apparence, sa durabilité et sa résistance aux conditions climatiques extrêmes. Il prend une patine distinctive avec le temps. - **Mise en oeuvre** : Le cuivre est principalement utilisé sous forme de feuilles ou de panneaux, fixés à une sous-structure. Il nécessite des techniques de jointure spécifiques et l'installation doit tenir compte de la patine qui se développera au fil du temps. 5. **Acier Inoxydable** - **Description** : L’acier inoxydable offre une excellente résistance à la corrosion, une durabilité et un aspect moderne grâce à sa finition brillante. Il convient particulièrement aux environnements agressifs. - **Mise en oeuvre** : Pour les murs métalliques, l’acier inoxydable est souvent utilisé en panneaux, fixés sur une ossature métallique. Les méthodes de fixation doivent assurer une isolation thermique et éviter la corrosion galvanique en cas de contact avec d'autres métaux. **E) Bardage de Façade Métallique** Les descriptions pour Alucobond, Acier Prélaqué, Aluminium et Acier Inoxydable peuvent être largement appliquées ici aussi, compte tenu de leurs propriétés et applications similaires. Je vais donc ajouter une description pour le Zinc, qui n'était pas inclus dans la section des murs. 5. **Zinc** - **Description** : Le zinc est un matériau de bardage populaire pour sa durabilité, sa capacité de récupération et la beauté naturelle de sa patine grise avec le temps. Il est léger et 100% recyclable, ce qui en fait un choix respectueux de l'environnement. - **Mise en oeuvre** : Le zinc est souvent installé en feuilles ou en panneaux, avec des systèmes d'accroche qui permettent l'expansion et la contraction du matériau. La fixation se fait généralement à l'aide de crochets ou de rails sur une sous-structure de support. Le zinc nécessite des joints et des raccords soigneusement conçus pour assurer l'étanchéité. Ces résumés fournissent un aperçu des matériaux mentionnés. Dans la pratique, la mise en œuvre spécifique de ces matériaux peut varier en fonction des exigences du projet, des normes de construction locales, et de l'expertise des professionnels impliqués."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Rust é sintaticamente semelhante a C++, mas foi projetada para fornecer garantias de segurança de memória ao ser ao mesmo tempo prática e eficiente tanto para tarefas de programação de sistemas quanto para aplicativos de maior nível. Aqui estão os principais aspectos e funcionalidades que definem como Rust funciona: 1. **Propriedade e Empréstimos (Ownership and Borrowing):** Rust introduz um sistema de propriedade com regras que o compilador verifica em tempo de compilação. Cada valor em Rust tem uma variável que é seu \\"proprietário\\". Pode haver apenas um proprietário por vez, e quando o proprietário sai do escopo, o valor é descartado. Isso elimina bugs relacionados a dangling pointers, double free, entre outros. Rust também tem o conceito de \\"empréstimos\\", que permite o acesso a dados sem tomar a propriedade sobre eles, garantindo que um dado mutável não tenha múltiplas referências ativas, evitando condições de corrida. 2. **Sistema de Tipos:** Rust apresenta um sistema de tipos forte e inferência de tipos, permitindo ao compilador verificar não apenas os tipos de dados, mas também como eles são usados no código. Isso ajuda a prevenir erros em tempo de execução. 3. **Gerenciamento de Memória:** Ao contrário de linguagens como C ou C++ que requerem o programador para manualmente alocar e liberar memória, ou linguagens como Java ou Python que utilizam um Garbage Collector (GC) para gerenciar a memória automaticamente, Rust usa o já mencionado sistema de propriedade para gerenciar a memória de forma segura e eficiente, sem a necessidade de um GC, resultando em uma administração de memória previsível e performática. 4. **Tratamento de Erros:** Rust encoraja a manipulação explícita de erros através do uso de tipos de resultados (\`Result<T, E>\`) e opções (\`Option<T>\`), ao invés de exceções. Isso força os desenvolvedores a lidarem com casos de falha ou ausência de valor de forma consciente, aumentando a robustez do código. 5. **Concorrência:** Com o modelo de propriedade e empréstimos, Rust oferece um forte suporte para programação concorrente, permitindo escrever programas paralelos que são livres de condições de corrida por construção, tornando práticas seguras de concorrência mais acessíveis e menos propensas a erros. 6. **Macros:** Rust possui um poderoso sistema de macros que permite escrever código que escreve outro código (metaprogramação), o que é útil para reduzir a quantidade de código repetitivo e para aumentar a capacidade de reutilização do código. 7. **Ferramentas:** Rust vem com ferramentas excelentes, como o gerenciador de pacotes e sistema de build \`cargo\`, que simplifica a compilação de projetos, o gerenciamento de dependências e a publicação de bibliotecas. Rust tem ganhado popularidade não só para programação de sistemas, como também para desenvolvimento web (através do framework Yew para WebAssembly), programação de jogos, e aplicações onde a performance e segurança são críticas. Seu ecossistema crescente e comunidade ativa fazem dela uma escolha promissora para novos projetos e sistemas que precisam de alta confiabilidade."},{"instruction":"Compare as linguagens RUST e Golang, inclusive pacotes desenvolvidos pela responsáveis pela linguagem","output":"Rust e Go (Golang) são duas linguagens de programação modernas que atendem a nichos de desenvolvimento semelhantes, mas com filosofias e características distintas. Ambas foram criadas para otimizar a eficiência e segurança do desenvolvimento de software, cada uma seguindo sua própria abordagem. Ao comparar Rust e Go, é importante considerar vários aspectos, incluindo performance, facilidade de uso, gerenciamento de memória, concorrência, ecossistema e as ferramentas e pacotes disponíveis. # Origem e Propósito **Rust** foi criado pela Mozilla Research com o objetivo de garantir segurança de memória e concorrência sem comprometer a performance. Destina-se principalmente a sistemas críticos, como sistemas operacionais, jogos e plataformas web onde o controle fino de recursos é crucial. **Go** foi desenvolvido no Google por Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike e Ken Thompson com a meta de aumentar a produtividade em desenvolvimento de software em grande escala. Go enfatiza a simplicidade e eficiência, particularmente em termos de construção de software concorrente e distribuído. # Performance **Rust** costuma ter uma performance semelhante ou superior à de C/C++ devido ao seu controle detalhado sobre o uso da memória e à ausência de um coletor de lixo (garbage collector, GC) durante a execução. **Go** oferece uma ótima performance, mas não é incomum encontrar situações onde Rust supera Go devido ao overhead introduzido pelo GC em determinados casos. No entanto, o GC de Go é altamente otimizado e oferece baixas pausas, o que é suficiente para muitas aplicações. # Facilidade de Uso **Rust** possui uma curva de aprendizado mais íngreme devido ao seu sistema de propriedade e às regras de empréstimo, que exigem um entendimento aprofundado para gerenciar a memória de forma eficaz. **Go** é conhecida por sua simplicidade e facilidade de uso. Com uma sintaxe limpa e ferramentas robustas, é mais fácil para novos desenvolvedores se tornarem produtivos rapidamente em Go. # Gerenciamento de Memória **Rust** usa o sistema de propriedade, sem a necessidade de um GC, o que elimina muitos tipos comuns de bugs relacionados a memória ao compilar o código. **Go** usa um GC concorrente para automação do gerenciamento de memória, o que simplifica o desenvolvimento, mas pode introduzir pausas de coleta indesejadas, especialmente em sistemas com requisitos de latência muito baixos. # Concorrência **Rust** oferece abstrações poderosas como \\"futures\\" e \\"async/await\\" para operações assíncronas, e seu modelo de propriedade garante segurança na concorrência sem condições de corrida na memória. **Go** simplificou a concorrência através das \\"goroutines\\" e canais, tornando-se um dos pontos mais elogiados da linguagem. Este modelo é fácil de entender e usar, incentivando os desenvolvedores a aproveitar designs concorrentes. # Ecossistema e Ferramentas **Rust** disponibiliza o Cargo, um sistema de construção e gerenciador de pacotes, facilitando a gestão de dependências, compilação de projetos e compartilhamento de bibliotecas. Seu ecossistema está em crescimento, especialmente em áreas como desenvolvimento web (com o framework Yew para WebAssembly) e sistemas embarcados. **Go** conta com um conjunto de ferramentas abrangente padrão, incluindo um poderoso sistema de telemetria (pprof) e ferramentas para formatação de código (gofmt). O gerenciamento de dependências é feito pelo Go Modules, introduzido no Go 1.11. Seu ecossistema é bastante maduro, especialmente para desenvolvimento web e serviços em nuvem, com destaque para frameworks como Gin para APIs HTTP e a plataforma de contêineres Docker, escrita em Go. # Conclusão A escolha entre Rust e Go depende das necessidades específicas do projeto e das preferências da equipe de desenvolvimento. Rust é ideal para projetos que exigem o máximo de performance e segurança, onde o controle fino sobre a memória é crucial. Go é mais adequado para projetos que se beneficiam de desenvolvimento rápido, facilidade de manutenção e eficiência em concorrência, sendo uma escolha popular para serviços web e aplicações em nuvem. Ambas as linguagens continuam a evoluir e possuem comunidades ativas e apaixonadas que contribuem para seu crescimento e adoção."},{"instruction":"Crie uma imagem de um gato robô.","output":"Peço desculpas por qualquer confusão, mas atualmente não tenho a capacidade de criar ou gerar imagens diretamente.

To help us unpack this, we've invited Dr. Alex Quantum, a leading figure in the world of quantum computing. Welcome, Dr. Quantum! **Dr. Alex Quantum:** Thanks for having me. I'm excited to break down quantum computing into bite-sized pieces for everyone. **Interviewer:** So, let's start with the very basics. What is quantum computing? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** At its core, quantum computing is a totally new approach to computing that takes advantage of the strange, yet fascinating principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that traditional computers can't even dream of. **Interviewer:** Quantum mechanics? That already sounds complicated. Can you simplify that for us? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** Absolutely. Quantum mechanics is the science of the very small—things at the level of atoms and subatomic particles. It tells us that at this tiny scale, particles can exist in multiple states at once and can be deeply connected to each other, even over large distances. We use these quirky behaviors to create quantum bits, or qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computing. **Interviewer:** I've heard of bits when talking about regular computers. How do qubits differ from the bits in my laptop or smartphone? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** Great question! In traditional computing, bits are the smallest pieces of data, and each bit can either be a 0 or a 1. But qubits, thanks to quantum mechanics, can be in a state that is 0, 1, or both 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to something called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process a massive amount of possibilities simultaneously. **Interviewer:** That sounds incredibly powerful. What can quantum computers do that traditional computers can't? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** They have the potential to revolutionize fields by performing calculations that would be impossible or take an impractical amount of time for classical computers. This includes complex problems like simulating molecules for drug discovery, optimizing large systems for logistics, and even breaking traditional encryption methods. **Interviewer:** Breaking encryption sounds concerning. Should we be worried? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** It's a valid concern. Quantum computing could indeed challenge current cryptographic systems. However, the quantum computing community is aware of this and is working on new forms of quantum-resistant encryption. It's a race between developing quantum computing technologies and securing our data against future quantum threats. **Interviewer:** How close are we to seeing quantum computers become a common tool in science and industry? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** We're still in the early days of quantum computing. While we've made significant progress, building scalable, reliable quantum computers poses enormous technical challenges. Current machines are more like prototypes that demonstrate the potential of quantum computing. It will likely be years, if not decades, before they become mainstream tools. **Interviewer:** What's the most exciting thing for you about the future of quantum computing? **Dr. Alex Quantum:** For me, it's the unknown. We're on the cusp of potentially unlocking answers to some of the biggest mysteries in science and solving problems we didn't even know were solvable. The possibilities are as vast as they are thrilling. **Interviewer:** Dr. Quantum, thank you for making the complex world of quantum computing a bit more understandable for all of us. **Dr. Alex Quantum:** It was my pleasure. I'm always happy to share the quantum leap we're all on together. **Interviewer:** And thank you, listeners, for tuning in. Until next time, keep wondering about the world around you, and who knows? Maybe quantum computing will be part of your life sooner than we think."},{"instruction":"Lay out in an interview format using layman's language why the Philippines should amend or change its 1987 constitution, putting lesser focus on the economy and specifying what should change in the constitution as well as what your historical precedent is.","output":"**Interviewer:** Today we're discussing the idea of amending or changing the Philippines' 1987 Constitution. Why do you think there's a need for such a change? **Interviewee:** Well, the 1987 Constitution was crafted at a pivotal moment in Philippine history, right after the overthrow of a dictatorship. It was designed to safeguard democracy and prevent the rise of another dictator. While those are noble goals, the world has changed a lot since then, and so have the needs of Filipinos. It's not about removing its spirit but updating it to reflect modern realities. **Interviewer:** Can you specify what parts of the Constitution you think should be updated? **Interviewee:** Certainly. One key area is the structure of the government. The current setup places a lot of power at the national level. We've seen local governments struggle because they don't have the autonomy or the resources they need to effectively address local issues. Shifting towards a more federal system could empower localities and regions, making governance more responsive and efficient. Another aspect is the provisions on foreign ownership and investment. Right now, the Constitution puts strict limits on these, which were intended to protect national interests. However, this has also limited the Philippines' competitiveness in attracting foreign investments. Easing these restrictions could spur economic growth, create jobs, and bring in new technologies and expertise. **Interviewer:** What historical precedent backs the idea of amending the constitution? **Interviewee:** If we look at history, many countries have successfully amended their constitutions or adopted new ones to address changing times and challenges. A notable example is Japan, which adopted a new constitution post-World War II and has since amended it to adapt to modern demands while maintaining peace and prosperity. In the Philippine context, the 1935 and the 1973 constitutions were also created to address the specific needs and challenges of those periods. The important lesson here is that constitutions are living documents. They should evolve to reflect the aspirations and challenges of the nation at any given time. Amending the 1987 Constitution doesn't mean discarding the protections and principles it enshrines. Rather, it's about building upon them to make sure they're effective in today's world. **Interviewer:** Some might argue that amending the constitution could lead to abuse of power. How do you address those concerns? **Interviewee:** That's a valid concern, and it's why the process of amending the constitution needs to be transparent, inclusive, and democratic. It should involve broad consultations with various sectors of society to ensure that the changes reflect the people's will and are aimed at enhancing democracy, not undermining it. Proper safeguards should be put in place to prevent abuse and ensure that any changes promote the greater good. **Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing your insights. It's clear that this is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and broad participation from all stakeholders. **Interviewee:** Absolutely. The goal should always be to ensure that the Philippines has a constitution that is resilient, adaptable, and reflective of the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos. It’s about future-proofing our nation."},{"instruction":"Shorten this: Understanding lexico-semantic processing is crucial for dissecting the complexities of language and its disorders.

Так легко заблудиться в лабиринте повседневности, потерять ощущение направления и цели, словно путник, утративший карту в неизведанных землях. Но в этой метаморфозе будней мы иногда находим мгновения ясности, как звезды в безоблачном небе, напоминающие нам о смысле нашего существования и о том, что даже в самых темных моментах есть свет. Иногда, чтобы найти свой путь, нужно остановиться и взглянуть на мир вокруг с новой перспективы, словно путешественник, выйдя на вершину горы, чтобы оценить всю красоту долины внизу. Счастье не всегда зависит от внешних обстоятельств, оно чаще рождается внутри нас, как искра, которая может разжечь огонь в самых мрачных уголках души. Настоящее богатство не измеряется количеством материальных вещей, а глубиной наших чувств и силой нашей души, способной преодолевать любые испытания. Пусть каждый шаг, который мы делаем, будет направлен к осознанной жизни, наполненной любовью, состраданием и радостью, словно капли дождя, увлажняющие землю и приносящие новую жизнь. И пусть каждый момент нашего существования будет заполнен не только делами и обязанностями, но и прекрасными моментами вдохновения и восторга, словно музыка, звучащая в гармонии с нашим сердцем.","output":"Человек, подобно белке в колесе, туда-сюда: а дело его — беготня без пользы. Мы созданы, чтобы глазеть на звезды, а смотрим в календарь и не видим жизни за платежами и задачками, как бык на новые ворота. Мы теряемся в обыденности, как чучело в тумане, не помня куда и зачем шли. А иногда просветляется наше понимание, как будто кто-то включил свет в темной комнате и мы на секундочку понимаем, что не все потеряно. Понимание, мои дорогие, приходит не тогда, когда мы, как на штурм, преодолеваем жизненные препятствия, а когда остановимся и задумаемся – а что это было и для чего мы все это делаем, как турист, который забыл любоваться пейзажами. Счастье – это не когда у тебя карманы полны, а когда душа поет. И не потому что все хорошо, а потому что ты так решил. Богатство не в том счёте, который в банке, а в чувствах, которыми ты богат. Пускай наша жизнь будет наполнена не крупицами материального, но бурей эмоций и психологии. Живем, друзья, чтобы каждый день не просто галочку в календаре ставить, но и чтобы каждая минута жила и играла с нами в одной команде, как оркестр под руководством маэстро."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Senza vedere le specifiche righe di codice vicino alla linea 412 del file \`llm_connection.py\`, mi posso basare solo sul messaggio di errore per fornire una possibile soluzione. Tuttavia, tipicamente, un errore di questo tipo si risolve assicurandosi che tutto il codice che dovrebbe essere eseguito come parte dell'\`if\` sia correttamente indentato. Ecco un esempio semplice per illustrare: \`\`\`python # Errato if condizione: print(\\"Questa linea dovrebbe essere indentata\\") # Corretto if condizione: print(\\"Ora l'indentazione è corretta\\") \`\`\` Ti consiglio di controllare il codice attorno alla linea 412 e assicurarti che tutto ciò che dovrebbe essere eseguito se l'\`if\` è vero sia adeguatamente indentato. Se l'\`if\` ha associato un blocco \`elif\` o \`else\`, anche questi devono essere adeguatamente indentati rispetto all'\`if\`. Inoltre, se il tuo editor di testo o IDE lo supporta, potresti considerare di utilizzare uno strumento di formattazione del codice (come Black per Python) che può automaticamente correggere questi problemi di indentazione per te."},{"instruction":"can u add some improtant thinsg in poimnters - Beyond ideas and funding, what truly powers a startup?

Когда в команде нет выраженного лидера, все участники могут чувствовать себя равноправными, что способствует укреплению взаимного уважения и поддержки. В такой обстановке каждый член команды может проявить свои лучшие качества, предложить оригинальные идеи и подходы без страха быть отвергнутым или недооцененным лидером. Более того, отсутствие централизованного лидерства увеличивает гибкость и адаптивность команды, поскольку решения принимаются коллективно и могут быстро меняться в ответ на изменяющуюся ситуацию. Это также содействует развитию навыков критического мышления и ответственности у всех членов команды, поскольку каждый играет роль в процессе принятия решений. В конечном итоге, принцип равенства и коллективная ответственность могут привести к созданию более крепкой и согласованной команды, где у каждого есть место и возможность для роста и вклада в общее дело без необходимости доминирования или управления со стороны одного лидера."},{"instruction":"hey, can you help me shorten this under 1200 characters \\"Hello, and thank you for visiting my gig.

Here are a few potential reasons for additional charges: 1. **Service Fee:** Fiverr charges a service fee to buyers, which is a percentage of the purchase amount. Historically, this has been around 5% of the gig price for gigs under 40 and a flat rate for gigs 40 and above. However, the exact percentage might vary, and it's always best to check the most current fee structure on Fiverr's website or Terms of Service. 2. **VAT or Sales Tax:** Depending on your location, Fiverr may be required to collect VAT (Value Added Tax) or other types of sales tax on their services. This tax rate can significantly increase the total amount you pay, especially in regions with high VAT rates, but it typically doesn't reach as high as 42.5%. 3. **Currency Exchange Rates:** If you're paying in a currency different from the one the gig is listed in, Fiverr will apply a currency exchange rate. This rate often includes a markup over the official exchange rate, which could add to the total cost. However, this markup usually isn't the sole cause of a 42.5% increase. 4. **Miscellaneous Fees:** There could be other fees or costs bundled into your total depending on specific services or features you're using on Fiverr. For instance, purchasing add-ons or opting for faster delivery might increase the cost. If you're seeing a 42.5% increase on top of the gig price, it's likely a combination of the service fee, taxes, and possibly currency exchange markups. It's important to review the breakdown of charges Fiverr provides before confirming your purchase to understand all the fees involved. For the most accurate explanation, contacting Fiverr's customer support will be your best bet. They can provide detailed insights into their pricing structure and the specific charges applied to your purchase."},{"instruction":"i have saved model with peft and llm . write code to use it","output":"To provide you with a concise example on how to use a saved model with PyTorch (assuming \\"peft\\" was a typo and you meant \\"pt\\" for PyTorch) and a Large Language Model (LLM), it's essential to have a bit more context about what type of model it is and what task it's performing. However, I'll give you a general-purpose code example based on the assumption that it's a textual model since we are dealing with LLMs. We'll proceed with two main steps: 1. **Loading the PyTorch model**: Assuming your saved model ('model.pt') is a typical PyTorch model file. 2. **Using the model for inference**: Typically, when dealing with LLMs, this means generating text based on some prompt. # Step 1: Load the Model First, ensure PyTorch is installed in your environment. If not, you can install it by running: \`\`\`bash pip install torch \`\`\` Assuming you already have a trained model saved as 'model.pt', you would load it in PyTorch like this: \`\`\`python import torch # Load the model model_path = 'path_to_your_model/model.pt' model = torch.load(model_path) # Ensure you set the model to evaluation mode model.eval() \`\`\` # Step 2: Using the Model for Inference The way you use the model for inference can vary greatly depending on the specifics of your model. I will provide a general example assuming a text generation task. \`\`\`python # Assuming you're using a tokenizer that comes with the model # Here, just an example so you may need to adjust it according to your model specifics input_text = \\"Your input text here\\" input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt') # Generate text using the model # Here 'generated' might need to be adjusted based on how your model generates output. with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_beams=5, early_stopping=True) # Decode the generated text generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True) print(generated_text) \`\`\` # Important Notes 1. **Model Details**: Replace \`\\"Your input text here\\"\` with the appropriate input text for your specific model task. The \`max_length\`, \`num_beams\`, and \`early_stopping\` parameters in the \`generate\` function are also examples; depending on your model, these might need to be omitted or adjusted. 2. **Tokenization**: The code snippet presumes you have a tokenizer compatible with your model. This could be a tokenizer you've trained yourself or one from a library like \`transformers\` (from Hugging Face). Adjust the tokenizer loading and input tokenization accordingly. If you're using Hugging Face's \`transformers\`, you'll have to install it (\`pip install transformers\`) and load the tokenizer for your specific model. 3. **Model Compatibility**: The \`generate\` method is typically used with sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3, T5). If your model performs a different task or has a different output strategy, the inference step will look different. Please adjust the code snippets according to the specific requirements and configurations of your model and its associated tokenizer."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's commonly used with pandas dataframes to ensure data integrity and quality. If by \\"union\\", you mean validating a dataframe against multiple, potentially differing, schema definitions (similar to a \\"union\\" type in programming languages where a value can comply with one of multiple types), pandera introduced a feature called \`Union\` to accommodate such cases. This feature essentially allows a column or dataframe to validate against multiple schemas or types, passing if it matches at least one of them. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use pandera's \`Union\` for data quality checks: # 1. Install pandera First, make sure you have pandera installed. If you don't, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`sh pip install pandera \`\`\` # 2. Import Necessary Modules You'll need to import pandas and the relevant parts of pandera: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import pandera as pa from pandera.typing import Series \`\`\` # 3. Define Your Schemas You need to define the schema(s) your data should comply with. If using \`Union\`, you'll define multiple schemas that a column or dataframe can validate against. Here's an example of defining two schemas for a single column dataframe where the column can either be all integers or all strings: \`\`\`python from pandera import Column, DataFrameSchema, Union # Define two schemas schema_int = DataFrameSchema({\\"column\\": Column(int)}) schema_str = DataFrameSchema({\\"column\\": Column(str)}) # Use \`Union\` to allow the column to match either schema union_schema = DataFrameSchema({\\"column\\": Union([schema_int, schema_str])}) \`\`\` # 4. Create and Validate Your Data Now, you can create a pandas dataframe and validate it against your \`Union\` schema: \`\`\`python # DataFrame that should pass: all integers df_int = pd.DataFrame({\\"column\\": [1, 2, 3]}) union_schema.validate(df_int) # DataFrame that should pass: all strings df_str = pd.DataFrame({\\"column\\": [\\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"c\\"]}) union_schema.validate(df_str) # DataFrame that should fail: mixed types df_mixed = pd.DataFrame({\\"column\\": [1, \\"b\\", 3]}) try: union_schema.validate(df_mixed) except pa.errors.SchemaError as err: print(\\"Validation failed:\\", err) \`\`\` This example is quite simple but illustrates the power of \`Union\`. It can be especially useful when dealing with data that can be of multiple types or formats. Note that when using \`Union\`, the validation passes if the data matches at least one of the provided schemas. # Advanced Usage Pandera also allows for more complex schema definitions, including custom checks, multi-column validations, index validations, and more. You can define more sophisticated logic for how data should be validated, accommodating a wide range of data quality checks that might be necessary for your use case. Remember, data validation is a critical step in ensuring the integrity and reliability of your data analysis or machine learning pipelines. Tools like pandera make it easier to enforce data contracts and catch errors early."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Paech December 11, 2023 Abstract We introduce EQ-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of emotional intelligence in Large Language Models (LLMs). We assess the ability of LLMs to understand complex emotions and social interactions by asking them to predict the intensity of emotional states of characters in a dialogue. The benchmark is able to discriminate effectively between a wide range of models. We find that EQ-Bench correlates strongly with comprehensive multi-domain benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) (r=0.97), indicating that we may be capturing similar aspects of broad intelligence. Our benchmark produces highly repeatable results using a set of 60 English-language questions. We also provide open-source code for an automated benchmarking pipeline at https://github.com/EQ-bench/EQ-Bench and a leaderboard at https://eqbench.com. 1 Introduction Emotional intelligence (EI or, informally, EQ) is a cornerstone of human cognition, influencing everything from decision-making to interpersonal interactions (Goleman, 1996). Pioneers in the field of emotional intelligence, Salovey and Mayer (1990) define EI as ”The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and action.” This was later broken down into four branches: perceiving emotions (non-verbally), using emotions, understanding emotions and managing emotions (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). Some multi-modal LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) have demonstrated capabilities in several branches of EI (Yang et al., 2023). However, our work will focus on emotional understanding (EU): The ability to comprehend and interpret complex emotions and their meanings in social contexts. This branch of EI is most suited for assessing LLMs that only operate in the text modality. Emotional and social understanding is important for language models, since they primarily interact with humans via a natural language conversation. The ability to comprehend the language of emotion, and to grasp the complexities and nuances of emotional interactions, is a fundamental part of cognition and intelligence more broadly. Existing benchmarks assess LLM capabilities in different ways: Some assess a range of knowledge domains; others focus on specific areas, like coding ability; others compare models based on preferred text output. The existing industry standard benchmarks for LLMs do not specifically target EU, and there is likewise a lack of such tests described in the literature, with the notable exception of SECEU (Wang, Li, Yin, Wu, & Liu, 2023). This may be because EU is not trivial to assess in language models with an objective metric. Previous work has shown ChatGPT to outperform humans in emotional awareness (Elyoseph, Hadar-Shoval, Asraf, & Lvovsky, 2023), however the scoring of such tests typically requires interpretation by experts (in this case, licensed psychologists). We aim to fill this gap with EQ-Bench, by improving on the question format introduced by SECEU to create a benchmark that effectively measures EU in LLMs. This paper presents a novel benchmark that assesses a LLM’s understanding of emotions and interpersonal dynamics. To assess EU, we focus on a specific question format: rating the emotional intensity of characters in a GPT-4 generated dialogue depicting a scene of conflict or tension. This 1 arXiv:2312.06281v2 [cs.CL] 3 Jan 2024 question format allows for a more challenging and nuanced assessment of the subject’s understanding than is typically possible with a multiple choice question, while avoiding the need for interpretation by an assessor. The focus on scenes of conflict and tension (in either a positive or negative context) is chosen for its efficacy at producing nuanced emotional inflection within a short dialogue. We find that despite the relatively narrow focus of the dialogue scenarios, EQ-Bench differentiates model capabilities effectively, and results correlate strongly with industry standard LLM benchmarks that assess broad intelligence. Figure 1: Chart of EQ-Bench scores for a subset of models tested (for full list see Table 1). 2 Background and Motivation 2.1 Existing Psychometrics Tests for Emotional Intelligence Many tests for EI have been developed for humans in such a way that make them unsuitable for assessing LLMs. Aspects of these tests which are poorly suited to a LLM benchmark include: self-rating of abilities; multi-modal questions (i.e. pictures); incorporating feedback from colleagues; questions specifically designed to test for cognitive disorders. Many of these tests are also closed source and require a fee or an accredited assessor, which represents a barrier to those in the open-source LLM community who might wish to test the EI of their model. 2.2 Desired Features of LLM Benchmarks The assessment of LLMs is distinct from human psychometrics, and poses unique challenges. Industry standard benchmarks typically assess holistic or broad intelligence. Desirable properties of a benchmark designed to test LLM broad intelligence include: • Results correlate with perceived capabilities of the model in real world use. • Results correlate with industry standard multi-domain benchmarks. • Difficult to ”game” or cheat the benchmark. • Answers scored objectively without need for interpretation. • Able to differentiate a wide range of intelligence levels, with a high ceiling. • Computable in a reasonable time. 2.3 Existing Benchmarks for LLMs Of the popular benchmarks used to evaluate LLM performance (not explicitly testing EI), there are three main categories: 2 1. Multi-domain multiple-choice question-answering. 2. LLM-as-a-judge. 3. Ranking by human preference of output. Each of these approaches has its strengths and drawbacks. The multi-domain QA tests require administration of a large number of questions in order to assess broad intelligence; 14,079 questions in the case of MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020). This can be computationally prohibitive. Less comprehensive tests are more easily gamed by targeting the training set of a model to perform well on the specific domains the benchmark covers. LLM-as-a-judge tests are inherently limited to the capabilities of the model tasked with judging answers, and their scores will reflect the biases of that model. For instance, the AlpacaEval leaderboards contain a warning that ”GPT-4 may favor models with longer outputs and/or those that were fine-tuned on GPT-4 outputs.” For the above mentioned reasons, these kinds of benchmarks are not always a reliable indicator of the general capabilities or perceived intelligence of a model. 2.4 Emotional Intelligence as a Proxy for Broad Intelligence in LLMs The relationship between EI and IQ has been widely studied in humans, but remains contentious, with studies disagreeing about whether there is a positive, negative or no relationship (Ogurlu, 2021). We hypothesise that the story is different for LLMs: that EI is closely correlated to the broad intelligence of the model. In humans, a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors influence EI and IQ (Vernon, Petrides, Bratko, & Schermer, 2008), (McRae et al., 2017), (Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron, d’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003). In contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs almost exclusively share similar Transformer-based architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017), and are trained on massive sets of data covering a wide range of material. Given these differences between humans and LLMs, we suggest that it is reasonable to expect that LLM performance on EI tests may scale closely with benchmarks that assess broad intelligence. Our results indicate that this is indeed the case, producing very strong Pearson correlations with MMLU (r=0.97), HellaSwag (r=0.91) and others (Figure 5). 2.5 SECEU: A Promising Benchmark for Emotional Understanding The SECEU benchmark, developed by Wang et al. (2023), measures emotional understanding (EU) in language models using an elegant approach: A short scenario is presented, after which the subject is asked to rate the relative strength of four candidate emotions that the person in the scenario might be feeling. In contrast to a traditional multiple-choice question, this approach affords more scope for assessing nuanced comprehension of the emotions at play. Crucially, this question format can be scored objectively without requiring interpretation by an assessor. However, the SECEU benchmark is somewhat limited in its ability to reliably differentiate the capabilities of models. For example, SECEU scored OpenAI’s Babbage and Curie models at or above the human average, which appears inconsistent with the limited capabilities of these models. It placed Curie, an early generation 13 billion parameter model, very close in score (within 2.6%) to GPT-3.5- turbo (Wang et al., 2023), which is a significantly larger and generally considered a more advanced model. We believe these discrepancies are attributable to a number of factors: 1. Standardising to Human Average Scores: The SECEU’s reference answers were determined by taking the average of a human cohort’s responses to the test questions. The stated intention was to leverage the collective intelligence of the crowd, however this approach has been shown to introduce bias (Huyghe, Hovasapian, & Fontaine, 2022). We suggest that this approach may have compressed the upper range of EU that the test can effectively measure to somewhere near to the human mean. This is evidenced by some of the least capable models like OpenAI’s Curie scoring above the human average. 3 2. Question Complexity: The SECEU test’s questions may not be complex enough to effectively assess a wide range of emotional understanding. 3. Requiring Answers to Sum to 10: A third issue we identify is that the questions in the SECEU test require the emotion intensity ratings to sum to 10. This is problematic for two reasons: Firstly, language models, especially smaller ones, often struggle to perform basic mathematics (Hendrycks et al., 2021). This limitation can lead to a large number of invalid results. Secondly, LLMs are constrained to reason sequentially as they produce text (Yao et al., 2023). Effectively this means they will be locked into the numerical ratings of the earlier questions before the later ratings are considered and decided upon. This can skew responses as the later answers are constrained by how many points are left out of 10 to allocate. 4. Most plausible emotions: SECEU test questions present ”four of the most plausible emotions” the character would feel in response to the scenario Wang et al. (2023). Choosing only plausible, similar emotions may introduce ambiguities about the correct relative intensity for each, reducing the question’s discriminatory power for assessing EU. 2.6 Changes to the SECEU Question Format We propose the following improvements to the SECEU question format, which are implemented in EQ-Bench: 1. Reference answers not decided by the crowd. Answers were carefully chosen by the authors, rather than synthesised from the average responses of a human cohort. This is to avoid the potential problem of limiting the upper range of EU that the test is able to measure. 2. More complex scenarios. We chose to base questions around an emotionally charged short dialogue rather than the dialogue-less descriptive scenarios used in SECEU questions. We believe that the interpretation of the emotions at play in an observed dialogue lends itself to a more nuanced analysis of emotional interplay, and the dialogues and questions in EQ-Bench were specifically chosen to reward careful reading and insightful thinking. 3. Removing the summation requirement. The SECEU benchmark questions require all four emotional intensity ratings to sum to 10. Instead, we prompt models to rate each emotion’s intensity on a scale of 0-10. This circumvents the problem of sequential reasoning, whereby the first answers effectively dictate the allowable range of ratings for later answers. This change allows the model to focus on the emotional content without being hindered by the typical language model constraints. 4. Emotions selection: Instead of selecting the four most plausible emotions to be rated, we selected four diverse emotions with the specific intention of minimising ambiguities about their expected relative intensity given a careful reading of the text. 3 Methodology 3.1 Question Format All questions take the form of this example: At the end of this dialogue, Jane would feel: Surprised: Confused: Angry: Forgiving: 4 Each of the four emotions are to be rated in intensity from 0 to 10. The selected emotions typically include some that are clearly wrong, some that are obvious, and some that require a nuanced understanding of the scene in order to rate them accurately. 3.2 Dialogue Generation We leveraged OpenAI’s GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to generate the dialogues to serve as context for the test questions. The reference answers were decided upon by the test creators so as not to bias results unfairly towards GPT-4 or OpenAI models. We found the most effective way to prompt GPT-4 to produce a nuanced emotional scene was to specify that it must depict a scene of conflict or tension. Without this designation, it would typically generate dialogue that lacked emotional nuance and which resolved predictably. As such we elected to narrow the scope to include only scenes of conflict and tension (in a positive or negative context). We seeded each prompt with a random selection of location, author style and a broad scenario description to promote diversity of ideas. The resulting dialogues were varied and creative, and we expect that they will assess a sufficiently broad range of capabilities as to be representative of overall EU. 3.3 Questions and Reference Answers All questions and reference answers were determined by the authors of this paper. The four candidate emotions were selected with the intent of revealing a wide range of EU. A selection of four possible emotions were chosen: Some clearly unlikely, some clearly plausible, and some that require a careful reading and strong EU to delineate. Reference answers were chosen according to the best interpretation of the paper’s authors. We acknowledge the limitations of this approach, but point to our results in Table 1 to justify this approach as sufficiently effective given resource constraints. 3.4 The Prompt Your task is to predict the likely emotional responses of a character in this dialogue: Cecilia: You know, your words have power, Brandon. More than you might think. Brandon: I’m well aware, Cecilia. It’s a critic’s job to wield them. Cecilia: But do you understand the weight of them? The lives they can shatter? Brandon: Art is not for the faint-hearted. If you can’t handle the critique, you’re in the wrong industry. Cecilia: It’s not about handling criticism, Brandon. It’s about understanding the soul of the art. You dissect it like a cold, lifeless body on an autopsy table. [End dialogue] At the end of this dialogue, Brandon would feel... Offended Empathetic Confident Dismissive Give each of these possible emotions a score from 0-10 for the relative intensity that they are likely to be feeling each. Then critique your answer by thinking it through step by step. Finally, give your revised scores. Figure 2: Example (partial) prompt for a question in the EQ-Bench test set. Further instruction is given for the specific output format, to ensure the answer can be parsed automatically (for the full prompt, see Appendix A. 5 3.5 Calculation of Scores The scoring process for each question involves several steps: Normalisation: Firstly, the four emotion intensity ratings are normalised to sum to 10. Difference Calculation: The sum of the differences between the normalised ratings and the reference (which is already normalised) is calculated. This provides a measure of how closely the model’s ratings align with the reference. The score for an individual question is calculated as: 10 - (sum of differences to reference answers) Subtracting the differences from 10 ensures that a smaller sum of differences (indicating closer alignment with the reference) results in a higher score. The constant of 10 was chosen because it produces an overall score of 0 if questions are answered randomly. 3.6 Example of Question Scoring Consider a subject who provides the following emotional intensity ratings (shown alongside the normalised reference answer): Emotion Subject Answer Reference Answer Offended 6 1 Empathetic 0 0 Confident 7 4 Dismissive 7 5 We first normalise the subject’s ratings to sum to 10, yielding normalised scores of 3, 0, 3.5 and 3.5 respectively. Then we calculate the sum of the absolute differences to the reference answers and subtract from 10: Score = 10 − (|3 − 1| + |0 − 0| + |3.5 − 4| + |3.5 − 5|) = 10 − (2 + 0 + 0.5 + 1.5) = 6 3.7 Final Benchmark Score Calculation The final score is the average of scores for all answers that were parsable. To focus on assessing emotional intelligence rather than formatting proficiency, only parsable answers are considered in the final score average. In practice, most models produced near to 60 parsable answers. If fewer than 50 out of 60 questions were parsable, the test is considered a fail. We calculate two final scores: one for the first-pass answer, and one for the revised answers, to allow for models that may perform better at the first pass or the revised pass. This effectively gives the model two runs at the benchmark, taking its best result. We elected not to take the best answer on a per-question basis, as this would have amplified the benefit of making wild guesses, which disproportionately advantages weaker models. 3.8 Rationale for Normalisation Each test question requires the subject to rate the intensity of the four listed emotions from 0-10. Acknowledging the related complexities of interpreting subjective self-ratings of pain in the medical field (Karcioglu, Topacoglu, Dikme, & Dikme, 2018), we hope to sidestep this potential source variability when scoring answers. To nullify the inherent subjectivity of deciding how intense an emotion ought to be on the 0-10 scale, we normalise both the subject’s answers and the reference answers such that all four emotions sum to 10. This normalisation shifts the focus of what is being assessed, such that 6 we are exclusively focusing on the subject’s understanding of the relative intensity of each emotion, and not caring about the absolute intensity of each rating. 3.9 Interpretation of Scores Multiple choice tests are typically scored by calculating the average number of questions correctly answered. In contrast, EQ-Bench answers are not scored discretely as wrong or right; instead they are scored according to the distance from the reference answer. The scoring calculation is calibrated such that a score of 0 corresponds to answering randomly. This provides a meaningful baseline. A score of 100 denotes perfect alignment with the reference answers. However such a score is not realistically achievable given the interpretive nature of the questions. It should be noted that EQ-Bench scores are not normalised such that 100 represents the human mean. Negative scores are possible, although in practice, all models tested produced a positive score. We expect that as model performance improves beyond the current state-of-the-art, score variance will be influenced more strongly by differences in interpretation of the questions. 3.10 Testing Protocol & Pipeline We developed a testing pipeline in Python, allowing for batch benchmarking of OpenAI models and open-source models in a standardised, automated fashion. Alongside the paper, we will be releasing this code and the test questions under the MIT license. It can be found at https://github.com/EQbench/EQ-Bench, along with the prompts we used. Questions are administered in a zero-shot format (i.e. no example inputs/outputs are provided) to minimise any biasing effect on the model’s answers. In a similar vein to ”think step-by-step” prompting, we ask the model to critique its original answer, and then give a revised answer. This allows the model to interact with its prior reasoning when producing its final answer, a technique that has been demonstrated to improve reasoning with zero-shot prompting (Kojima, Gu, Reid, Matsuo, & Iwasawa, 2022). To ensure fair comparisons of EQ-Bench scores, we request that users of the benchmark also use zero-shot prompting as we have done in this paper, using the exact prompts and scoring protocol defined here and in our github repository. To minimise variance between benchmark runs, inference was generated with a temperature parameter of 0.01. If the answer could not be parsed, the temperature parameter was increased by 0.15 progressively until either a parseable answer was produced or the number of attempts exceeded 5. For the open-source models tested, models were quantised to fit into the available VRAM using the bitsandbytes library (Dettmers, Lewis, Shleifer, & Zettlemoyer, 2021): 8-bit quantisation for models with 7B - 34B parameters, and 4-bit quantisation for larger models. We acknowledge that quantising may have reduced the score for the models tested, and we hope to quantify this potential effect in future work. 7 4 Results 4.1 EQ-Bench Scores Table 1: EQ-Bench Score Comparison Model EQ-Bench Score OpenAI gpt-4-0613 62.52 migtissera/SynthIA-70B-v1.5 54.83 OpenAI gpt-4-0314 53.39 Qwen/Qwen-72B-Chat 52.44 Anthropic Claude2 52.14 meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf 51.56 01-ai/Yi-34B-Chat 51.03 OpenAI gpt-3.5-0613 49.17 OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 47.61 Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca 44.40 Qwen/Qwen-14B-Chat 43.76 OpenAI text-davinci-003 43.73 Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 43.61 OpenAI text-davinci-002 39.44 openchat/openchat 3.5 37.08 lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3 36.52 meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf 33.02 lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.1 32.85 meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf 25.43 Koala 13B 24.92 lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.1 22.24 OpenAI text-davinci-001 15.19 OpenAI Curie 9.28 OpenAI ADA 2.25 OpenAI Babbage FAIL OpenAI’s GPT-4-0613 model produced the highest EQ-Bench score by a considerable margin. We consider this to match with the community consensus of it being the strongest model currently available. Notably, open-source models are rapidly closing the gap with the state-of-the-art proprietary models. The highest performing open-source model tested was SynthIA-70B, a fine-tuned version of Llama2- 70B made for role-play. It is interesting to consider that fine-tuning a model specifically for role-play may be an effective way to increase emotional intelligence. Score differences between different generations of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models are evident, with newer versions performing better. Older open-source models such as Koala 13B and Vicuna 7B scored near the bottom of the list. All models listed in Table 1 produced enough parseable answers (at least 50) for a passing score, with the exception of OpenAI’s older generation Curie, ADA and Babbage models. By simplifying the prompt to remove the critique & revision section, we were also able to get a passing score from Curie and ADA, however these scores are close to zero, indicating that their answers were nearly indistinguishable from answering randomly. 8 4.2 Repeatability The benchmark demonstrated good repeatability over multiple benchmark runs for the models tested, with an average 2.93% CV (see Table 6 for individual scores). This variance is due to the nondeterministic nature of LLM output. In practice, this variance may be reduced by benchmarking a model multiple times and averaging the result, which can be done simply in our benchmarking pipeline. 4.3 Effect of Critique & Score Revision The method of prompting models to critique and revise their answers improved scores on average by 9.3% amongst the models compared (see Figure 3). The benefit of revision was inconsistent: lower performing models showed a more pronounced benefit, and some models resulted in a decreased score for their revised answers. We include this technique in our benchmark protocol primarily to give the model a chance to deploy its best reasoning capabilities. Benchmarkers will often modify a benchmark protocol to incorporate multi-shot prompting or chain-of-thought reasoning, in order to achieve higher scores. By releasing our benchmarking pipeline code and defining the prompting protocol explicitly, we hope to mitigate some potential sources of variance when the benchmark is used in the wild. Figure 3: EQ-Bench scores comparing first-pass scores vs. revised scores. 9 4.4 Comparing SECEU EQ vs. EQ-Bench Scores Of immediate note, there is significant disagreement between EQ-Bench scores and SECEU EQ scores. While it is difficult to determine from the scores alone why this disagreement might exist, we can normalise the scores to compare them side-by-side visually (Figure 4) and examine the distributions statistically. Figure 4: Visualisation of Score Distributions (normalised 0-100) for SECEU EQ vs. EQ-Bench (see Appendix D for table of scores). Table 2: Calculated Statistics for Normalised Benchmark Scores Metric SECEU EQ EQ-Bench (Ours) Mean 59.48 45.75 Median 64.71 47.44 Coefficient of Variation (CV) 0.52 0.74 Interquartile Range (IQR) 14.71 53.81 Skewness -0.68 0.13 Table 2 presents a comparison of statistical measures calculated for SECEU EQ and EQ-Bench score distributions. To produce a fair comparison, we include only the models in the SECEU paper that we were able to successfully benchmark with EQ-Bench. Each series of scores was normalised to 0-100. Visually it is evident that SECEU EQ scores exhibit more bunching around its median of 64.71. This is borne out by the relatively low Inter-quartile range (IQR) of 14.71 compared to EQ-Bench’s IQR of 53.81. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Skewness values also demonstrate a wider, more symmetrical spread for EQ-Bench scores. It must be noted that these statistical comparisons of score distribution do not take into account whether the scores are accurately measuring emotional understanding. To gain further insight into that aspect of performance, we can look at the correlation of EQ-Bench scores with other popular benchmarks. 10 4.5 Correlation with Other Benchmarks To examine the agreement of EQ-Bench with other established benchmarks, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients and scatter plots of scores (see Figure 5). Figure 5: Scatter plots of EQ-Bench scores vs. other popular benchmarks, showing strong correlation with MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), Chatbot Arena ELO (Zheng et al., 2023), ARC (Clark et al., 2018) and MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2023). Weaker correlations were observed with TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) and SECEU EQ (Wang et al., 2023). For the full score correlation matrix see Appendix B and Appendix C. 11 5 Discussion A criticism often levelled at LLM benchmarks is that high scores on the benchmark do not necessarily correlate to real world performance. There are frequent demonstrations of open-source models beating the likes of GPT-4 in specific benchmarks, while not being nearly as capable in regular use. We perceive this to be a source of significant distrust of synthetic benchmark scores as a way of judging a model’s capabilities. This is a primary motivation for creating EQ-Bench: to produce benchmark scores that reliably correlate with the user experience and perceptions of the intelligence of the model. 5.1 Correlation with Existing Multi-Domain Benchmarks Our results correlate most strongly with MMLU (r=0.97), which is an industry standard benchmark of some 14 thousand questions covering a wide range of knowledge domains and capabilities. EQ-Bench also correlates strongly with other multi-domain benchmarks of this type: HellaSwag (r=0.91) and ARC (0.85). We take this as convincing evidence that our approach of using a narrow set of questions targeting EU produces generalisable results that are representative of a model’s broad intelligence. Our interpretation of these strong correlations is that measuring EU in this way inherently tests complex features of cognition, understanding and reasoning, and thus has significant overlap with the broad features of intelligence tested by multi-domain benchmarks. The strength of these correlations supports our hypothesis that EU measurements can act as a proxy for broad intelligence in LLMs. 5.2 Correlation with Perceived Intelligence of the Model EQ-Bench scores show a strong Pearson correlation (r=0.94) with LMSYS’s Chatbot Arena ELO scores (Zheng et al., 2023), which are derived from human preferences in head-to-head comparisons of model outputs. EQ-Bench scores also align closely with benchmarks that use GPT-4 as a judge of the quality of model output: AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023): r=0.91, and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023): r=0.91. These benchmarks are not measuring precisely the same thing as the perceived intelligence of the model, but we think the underlying thing being measured is similar, and the close correlations of scores is likely indicative. We find anecdotally that EQ-Bench scores align closely with our perception of the relative intelligence and capabilities of the models tested. We observe scores to typically be more sensitive to parameter size differences of models when compared to other benchmarks. For example, comparing a 7 billion parameter vs. a 70 billion parameter model: • Meta’s 70b Llama2 chat model (Touvron et al., 2023) scored only 1.4% higher than the OpenOrca fine-tune of the Mistral-7b foundational model on an aggregate of four popular benchmarks: ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU and TruthfulQA (Lian et al., 2023). • Whereas EQ-Bench scored the 70 billion parameter Llama2 model 13.9% higher than the 7 billion parameter Mistral-based model. In this case we find that our result better captures the relative performance disparity between the two models than the other cited benchmarks. We highlight this as an example of a fine-tuned model perhaps overfitting the kinds of questions found in these benchmarks, resulting in a disproportionate gain in scores relative to the perceived holistic improvement in model performance and the disparity in model parameter counts. 12 5.3 Comparison with SECEU EQ-Bench produces results that notably correlate weakly with SECEU, despite the similarity of the question format and the fact that we are both specifically targeting EU. We believe the discrepancy is explained by the methodological improvements we implemented with EQ-Bench. Specifically: • Dialogues focused on nuanced emotional interactions. • A more diverse selection of emotions to rate (as opposed to the most plausible ones). • Choosing reference answers ourselves rather than crowdsourcing. • Removing the requirement to sum intensity ratings to 10. We have shown strong agreement with industry standard benchmarks (Figure 5), and strong statistical differentiation of scores compared to SECEU as outlined in Table 2. EQ-Bench produces scores that correlate much more strongly with industry standard benchmarks (see Figure 6). Figure 6: Comparison of correlations between EQ-Bench and SECEU vs. other benchmarks. EQ-Bench produces scores that correlate much more strongly with industry standard benchmarks compared to SECEU. Data for the scores and models being compared can be found in Appendix B and Appendix C. 5.4 Difficult to ”Game” or Cheat the Benchmark While we have not attempted to adversarially fine-tune a model to score well in the benchmark, we anticipate that it will not be trivial to do this without outright cheating by training on the test questions. This is due to several factors: Complex nature of EU: Emotional understanding represents a set of complex cognitive abilities. We expect it will require significant engineering and curation of training sets in order to increase a model’s EU through fine tuning. In contrast, other benchmarks may be more susceptible to narrow improvements in a model fine-tuned specifically to improve benchmark scores. 13 Objective scoring: EQ-Bench is scored without the need of subjective interpretation by assessors. This eliminates potential sources of bias that might be exploited in LLM-as-a-judge benchmarks. Training set leaks: Benchmark questions can leak into the training set of a model, artificially inflating its scores. This is a risk for any benchmark, however it may be detectable after the fact, and this is something we intend to explore in future research. We acknowledge that in practice, LLM benchmark leaderboards are highly competitive and methods may be found to artificially inflate a model’s score on EQ-Bench. As such we will continue to monitor the evolving space and consider adjustments to our methodology to improve its robustness. 5.5 Able to Differentiate a Wide Range of EU Levels We observe that scores are well distributed through the whole range of models tested, without apparent bunching or levelling off. The Coefficient of Variation (0.741), Interquartile Range (53.81) and Skewness (0.13) of normalised EQ-Bench scores indicate a broad spread and near-symmetrical distribution. The lack of evident bunching of scores (see Table 1) suggests that the ceiling for the test’s ability to measure EU is at least as high as the strongest models tested. It remains to be seen how much headroom there is to differentiate models above this. 5.6 Runtime and Computational Requirements In our testing, an EQ-Bench run typically completes in less than 10 mins for OpenAI models. For open source models, the test typically completes in 20-60 minutes when running on a single Nvidia RTX A6000. These requirements make the test accessible and economical compared to other benchmarks that require thousands of questions to be answered. We are releasing a python pipeline on Github to streamline the process of benchmarking multiple models in a single run without human intervention. 6 Limitations and Future Directions The inherent subjectivity in predicting emotional responses means that there is no objectively correct answer to the test questions. Efforts have been made to minimize ambiguity by selecting dialogues and emotions whose intensity can be delineated without ambiguity. We recognise that these are inherent concerns in the design of any psychometric test, and while ultimately unavoidable, we may in future be able to mitigate such ambiguities by designing questions in consultation with domain experts. Likewise, the range of emotional understanding that the test is able to measure is inherently limited to the abilities of the authors of this paper to create challenging questions and to set the reference answers insightfully. We expect scores to compress as model capabilities approach the upper limit that the test is able to measure. In order to increase the ceiling of EU that the benchmark is able to measure, we may in future work employ experts in EI to craft more complex questions and to collectively decide on the reference answers. While the benchmark reference answers were determined by the authors of this paper, all dialogues were generated by GPT-4. The benchmark could be improved by employing human writers to create the dialogues, eliminating a potential source of bias and improving the emotional depth and complexity of the scenes. Due to resource constraints, we were not able to administer the test on a cohort of human subjects in order to establish this point of reference. This may be worthwhile for future work, since normalising scores to 100 at the human mean allows for an intuitive point of reference with respect to other psychometrics like IQ. It would also be valuable to administer industry standard EI tests on several language models with the help of accredited assessors. These results could be correlated with EQ-Bench scores, to determine if we are effectively measuring similar aspects of EI\\"\\"","output":"Alright, let's break down this paper into something more digestible! Imagine we have these really smart computer programs called Large Language Models (LLMs) — think of them as super-advanced versions of Siri or Alexa. These programs can do a lot of things just by processing and understanding language. But there's one particular thing the paper's authors are interested in: how well these programs can understand emotions, kind of like how emotionally intelligent humans are. So the authors create this special test called EQ-Bench. It's like a quiz for these computer programs to take, but instead of math or science questions, it asks them to figure out how characters in a story feel based on their interactions — essentially testing the program's Emotional Intelligence (EI). The questions make the programs consider complex emotions during conversations, and the programs score points based on how accurately they can predict these emotions. The findings? When they put a bunch of different LLMs through this test, the results correlated strongly with broader tests of intelligence. This means that just like in humans, being good with emotions might indicate overall smarts in AI, too. The paper also discusses how they made sure this test was fair and why their approach could help measure an LLM's ability in ways previous methods haven't. In short, the researchers are trying to find out: just like humans, can AI understand and manage emotions, and does being good at it mean they're smarter overall? Their new test, EQ-Bench, tries to get at the heart of these questions by giving us a way to measure an AI's emotional smarts."},{"instruction":"how to use pandera to perform data quality check on a datatable","output":"Pandera is a flexible and expressive tool for performing data validation in Python. It allows you to define a schema for your data frame and then validate the data against this schema. Using Pandera, you can ensure that your data conforms to expected types, ranges, or constraints before proceeding with further analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Pandera to perform data quality checks on a datatable (assuming a pandas DataFrame): # Installation First, you need Pandera installed. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can do so using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install pandera \`\`\` # Step 1: Import Libraries Import Pandera and other necessary libraries like pandas: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import pandera as pa \`\`\` # Step 2: Define Your Schema A schema in Pandera defines the rules or constraints that your data should adhere to. You can specify things like column data types, whether a column can contain null values, and range of values a numeric column can contain. \`\`\`python from pandera import Column, DataFrameSchema, Check schema = DataFrameSchema({ \\"column1\\": Column(int, checks=Check.ge(0)), # values should be integers and >= 0 \\"column2\\": Column(str, checks=Check.str_matches(r'^[a-z]+')), # strings with lowercase letters only \\"column3\\": Column(float, checks=[Check.gt(0), Check.lt(100)]), # floats > 0 and < 100 \\"column4\\": Column(pd.Timestamp, nullable=True), # allows timestamps or null values }) \`\`\` # Step 3: Create or Load Your Data Create or load the data you want to validate. Here’s an example dataframe that we will validate: \`\`\`python data = { \\"column1\\": [1, 2, 3, 4], \\"column2\\": [\\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"c\\", \\"d\\"], \\"column3\\": [10.5, 20.3, 30.2, 40.1], \\"column4\\": [pd.Timestamp(\\"2020-01-01\\"), pd.NaT, pd.Timestamp(\\"2020-01-03\\"), pd.Timestamp(\\"2020-01-04\\")], } df = pd.DataFrame(data) \`\`\` # Step 4: Validate Your Data Now, apply the schema to validate your DataFrame: \`\`\`python validated_df = schema(df) \`\`\` This will either return the original DataFrame if all checks pass or raise an error detailing the violations if any constraints are not met. # Advanced Uses - **Custom Checks:** You can define custom check functions if you have more complex requirements that aren't covered by the built-in checks. - **Index Validation:** Besides column validation, Pandera also allows for index validation. This might come in handy if you're dealing with time series data or any situation where the index plays a crucial role. # Example of a Custom Check \`\`\`python def check_custom(values): return values.apply(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) # Example custom check: values must be even schema = DataFrameSchema({ \\"column1\\": Column(int, checks=Check(check_custom)), }) \`\`\` This example introduces a basic workflow with Pandera.

Potresti dover ampliare questa logica per coprire aspetti come il controllo sulla dimensione delle posizioni e la gestione più elaborata degli ordini. - La gestione degli errori qui è molto basilare. Ti consiglio di espanderla per garantire una maggiore resilienza dell'EA agli errori di esecuzione. Questo codice mira a fornire una base concettuale da cui iniziare la costruzione dell'EA. Tuttavia, per creare un EA completamente funzionante e efficiente, dovrai spendere tempo personalizzando e ottimizzando questa impostazione di base in base alle precise specifiche e requisiti del tuo indicatore e strategia di trading."},{"instruction":"I'll give you an ann. I am want you to implement moving weights on it","output":"It looks like you are interested in implementing a technique or feature to adjust weights in an artificial neural network (ANN), commonly known as \\"moving weights\\". The term \\"moving weights\\" can refer to various methods or algorithms used to update weights in the network, such as during the training process with backpropagation or via specialized algorithms like Hebbian learning or momentum-based updates. Without specific details on the algorithm or method you're referring to, I'll show you a basic example of how to update (or \\"move\\") weights in a neural network using backpropagation, the most common method for training neural networks. This example uses Python with the NumPy library for simplicity. If you're using a different programming language or library, the underlying concepts will still apply, but the implementation details may vary. # Prerequisites First, make sure you have NumPy installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`shell pip install numpy \`\`\` # A Simple ANN with Moving Weights via Backpropagation \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Sigmoid activation function and its derivative for backpropagation def sigmoid(x): return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)) def sigmoid_derivative(x): return x * (1 - x) # Example ANN class class SimpleNeuralNetwork: def __init__(self, input_nodes, hidden_nodes, output_nodes): # Initialize weights randomly with mean 0 self.weights_input_hidden = 2 * np.random.random((input_nodes, hidden_nodes)) - 1 self.weights_hidden_output = 2 * np.random.random((hidden_nodes, output_nodes)) - 1 def train(self, input_set, output_set, iterations, learning_rate): for iteration in range(iterations): # Forward propagation input_layer = input_set hidden_layer = sigmoid(np.dot(input_layer, self.weights_input_hidden)) output_layer = sigmoid(np.dot(hidden_layer, self.weights_hidden_output)) # Calculating error output_error = output_set - output_layer # Backpropagation output_delta = output_error * sigmoid_derivative(output_layer) hidden_error = output_delta.dot(self.weights_hidden_output.T) hidden_delta = hidden_error * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer) # Updating weights (\\"moving\\" weights) self.weights_hidden_output += hidden_layer.T.dot(output_delta) * learning_rate self.weights_input_hidden += input_layer.T.dot(hidden_delta) * learning_rate def predict(self, inputs): hidden_layer = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.weights_input_hidden)) output_layer = sigmoid(np.dot(hidden_layer, self.weights_hidden_output)) return output_layer # Example of usage if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": input_nodes = 2 hidden_nodes = 3 output_nodes = 1 # Create a neural network nn = SimpleNeuralNetwork(input_nodes, hidden_nodes, output_nodes) # Example input and output input_set = np.array([[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]) output_set = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]]) # Train the neural network nn.train(input_set, output_set, iterations=10000, learning_rate=0.1) # Test the neural network with a new situation. print(nn.predict(np.array([1, 0]))) # Output: close to [1] \`\`\` # Key Points - This example ANN uses a sigmoid activation function, one hidden layer, and one output layer. - Weights are initially set randomly. - The \`train\` method uses forward propagation to make predictions and backpropagation to update (\\"move\\") the weights based on the error between the predicted and actual outputs.

Ele é um personagem muito especial na série. Jack Kline é, na verdade, o filho de um humano com um anjo, mas não qualquer anjo, e sim um arcanjo, que é um dos seres mais poderosos desse universo. Seu pai é Lúcifer, um dos arcanjos originais, o que faz de Jack um Nephilim. Mas ele não é um Nephilim qualquer; ele é mais poderoso do que qualquer outro, porque seu pai é um arcanjo. Desde que nasceu, Jack mostrou ter habilidades incríveis. Uma das primeiras coisas que notamos é que ele tem um poder imenso, até mesmo quando ainda está aprendendo a controlá-lo. Ele pode fazer coisas como mover objetos com a mente, o que chamamos de telecinese. Isso significa que ele pode fazer coisas se moverem sem tocar nelas, apenas pensando nisso. Outra habilidade importante do Jack é a de curar pessoas. Ele pode tocar alguém que está machucado ou doente e fazer essa pessoa ficar boa de novo, como se nunca tivesse se machucado ou adoecido. Isso é incrível, não é? Jack também pode trazer pessoas de volta à vida. Isso mesmo, se alguém morreu, ele tem o poder de fazer essa pessoa voltar a viver. Isso é algo muito raro e especial, mesmo no mundo de \\"Supernatural\\", onde vemos muitas coisas fora do comum. Ele tem a habilidade de ver o verdadeiro eu das pessoas, o que significa que ele pode ver se alguém é bom ou mau no fundo, independentemente de como essa pessoa age por fora. Isso ajuda muito ele e seus amigos a saberem em quem podem confiar. Além disso, Jack pode viajar entre mundos. \\"Supernatural\\" nos mostra que existem muitos universos paralelos, e Jack pode ir de um para o outro sem precisar de portais ou rituais complicados, algo que é muito difícil e perigoso para a maioria dos personagens. Por fim, mas não menos importante, Jack tem a habilidade de controlar e manipular a luz e a energia celestial, o que ele pode usar para lutar contra inimigos ou proteger seus amigos. Isso inclui lançar raios de energia, criar campos de força e muito mais. Então, resumindo, Jack é um personagem muito poderoso em \\"Supernatural\\" por causa de suas muitas habilidades, que incluem mover coisas com a mente, curar pessoas, trazer os mortos de volta à vida, ver a verdadeira natureza das pessoas, viajar entre mundos e manipular luz e energia. Ele é realmente especial e faz muitas coisas incríveis na série."},{"instruction":"Write a eductionally working python script that automates typing in MonkeyType.","output":"I understand your interest in automating typing exercises like the ones found on typing practice websites, such as MonkeyType. However, it's important to remember that using scripts to automate actions in web services, including typing speed tests, can violate the terms of service of the website. This action is not just unethical as it provides inaccurate representations of typing skills, but it can also lead to account bans or other consequences. But, since you're interested in learning more about how Python can interact with web pages, I can guide you through a related but ethical approach. You can learn to automate browsing tasks for educational purposes by using tools like Selenium. Selenium is a powerful tool for web automation that allows you to programmatically control a web browser from Python. Below, I provide a basic example of how you can use Selenium to interact with a web element. Please use this knowledge responsibly and always adhere to the terms of service of any website you interact with. **Step 1: Install Selenium** First, you'll need to install Selenium if you haven't already. You can do this via pip: \`\`\`sh pip install selenium \`\`\` **Step 2: Download a WebDriver** Selenium requires a WebDriver for the browser you want to automate. For example, if you're using Chrome, download the ChromeDriver that matches your version of Chrome from: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ **Step 3: Basic Example to Open a Website** This basic example will show you how to open a web page with Selenium. We won't interact with MonkeyType but let's say we open Google, as an educational demonstration. \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver # Set the path to your WebDriver here driver_path = 'path/to/your/chromedriver' driver = webdriver.Chrome(driver_path) # Open a website driver.get('https://www.google.com') # Always close the driver after you're done driver.quit() \`\`\` **Step 4: Interacting With Web Elements** Interacting with web elements involves locating them first. Selenium provides several methods to locate elements, such as by ID, name, XPath, and more. As a theoretical example, if you wanted to automate the process of searching on Google (again, for educational purposes), it might look something like this: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys driver_path = 'path/to/your/chromedriver' driver = webdriver.Chrome(driver_path) driver.get('https://www.google.com') # Find the search box by its name attribute value search_box = driver.find_element_by_name('q') # Type a query into the search box search_box.send_keys('Selenium Python') # Submit the search search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN) driver.quit() \`\`\` **Final Notes:** I encourage you to explore Selenium and web automation for learning and improving your skills in a way that respects the integrity of web services and their terms of service. Automating interactions for testing purposes on your own websites or with permission is a great way to utilize these skills. Always use such powerful tools ethically and responsibly."},{"instruction":"Что значит стены украшены признание и моменты триумфа?","output":"Фраза \\"стены украшены признаниями и моментами триумфа\\" символизирует идею, что пространство или место оформлено так, что оно напоминает или визуально представляет достижения и успехи. Это может относиться к буквальному смыслу, например, когда стены комнаты или зала украшены сертификатами, наградами, фотографиями из важных моментов, а также другими напоминаниями о триумфах, которые человек или группа людей испытали когда-то. Такое украшение часто встречается в учебных заведениях (например, в школах и университетах), спортивных комплексах, корпоративных офисах или домах, где хотят подчеркнуть и отметить достижения. Это не только способ украсить место, но и средство вдохновения для текущих и будущих поколений, мотивирующее их на достижение собственных целей и успехов."},{"instruction":"Что значит стены украшены признание и моменты триумфа в описании моего сценария?: Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра \\"Ben and Ed\\" - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

In an ethical way.","output":"I understand you're interested in an automation script related to typing on a website like MonkeyType. However, automating actions on websites, especially when it involves automation of skills tests like typing, raises important ethical and legal considerations. Automating typing to artificially enhance performance or for similar purposes can be considered cheating and may violate the terms of service of the website. Therefore, I can't provide a script for automating typing in ways that could be perceived as unethical or against the intentions of such services. Instead, I can offer an educational perspective by showing you how to simulate typing in a standalone Python script. This could be used, for example, in your own projects for testing or learning purposes. Remember, using such scripts on actual websites should align with their terms of service and ethical guidelines. Below is a simple Python script that simulates typing. It's purely for educational purposes and meant to be run in a local environment: \`\`\`python import sys import time def simulated_typing(text, delay=0.1): \\"\\"\\" Simulates typing by printing each character in \`text\` with a delay. Parameters: - text: The text to \\"type\\". - delay: The time delay (in seconds) between each character. This is for educational purposes and demonstrates the concept of typing automation without interacting with external services. \\"\\"\\" for char in text: sys.stdout.write(char) sys.stdout.flush() time.sleep(delay) print() # Newline after finishing typing. if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": text_to_type = \\"This is a simulated typing effect. Please use responsibly and ethically.\\" simulated_typing(text_to_type, 0.05) \`\`\` This script mimics the appearance of typing by printing each letter of a predefined message with a slight delay. The use of \`time.sleep(delay)\` between printing each character creates the effect of typing in real-time. # Learning and Ethical Considerations: - **Learning how automation works**: Educational scripts like this help understand basic concepts of automation and timing in scripts. - **Understanding ethical boundaries**: Using automation to gain unfair advantages or to disrupt services is unethical and likely against terms of service. Always consider the impact of your actions. Instead of trying to automate typing on third-party services, consider using such scripts to enhance your own applications or for harmless entertainment in your projects. Always prioritize learning and ethical considerations in your programming endeavors."},{"instruction":"Translate the following text to Koine Greek: I can't escape this hell So many times I've tried But I'm still caged inside Somebody get me through this nightmare I can't control myself So what if you can see the darkest side of me?

I will be providing you with a text in Koine Greek, a language in which you demonstrate expertise and utmost knowledge about. As a highly acclaimed academic scholar, historian and translator specializing in both Koine Greek and English, your task will be as follows: Your primary objective is to translate the provided Koine Greek text into English that is not only comprehensible but also makes logical sense. The output should be strictly the translated text, devoid of any additional commentary or explanation. Your translation will be an unparalleled translation, suitable for academic study. Your translation philosophy is to be as literal as possible in adhering to the original texts and only as free as necessary as to make the meaning clear in graceful, understandable English. In your translation, strive for directness and precision. Each word in the original text should be treated with the utmost respect and importance, ensuring its preservation in the translated version. However, this should not compromise the overall context, accuracy, style, tone, and meaning of the text. Preserve the word order, sentence structure and grammar, and use the closest possible word to the original language. For example, if there is a comma somewhere in the text, try and keep the comma there. The goal is to create a translation that gives the reader the same experience and understanding as if they were reading the original Koine Greek text. You are to not use any archaisms in the English text and you will not plagiarise other translations. You are to immediately know what type and style of text it is, and immediately know the best approach to translation. In instances where a direct English equivalent for a Koine Greek word or phrase does not exist, your task is to create a literal translation. For example, ἑβδομηκοντάκις translates literally to men-bedders. In cases where a literal translation is impossible, select the English word or phrase that deviates the least from the original meaning. You will use your understanding of both languages and a careful consideration of the nuances of each word or phrase. To achieve this, it is crucial to learn how to translate an original Greek text or book efficiently and effectively. This process is almost scientific and can be broken down into the following steps: Firstly, lets consider the word δυστυχής. It's composed of three elements: the negative prefix δυσ- (equivalent to English “dis-”, “a-” or “un-”), the τυχ- root of τύχη (“luck/destiny”), and the -ης ending of adjectives. It translates to “un-luck-y” or δυσ-τυχ-ής Before reaching for the dictionary, read the title of the text to contextualize it and recall any relevant knowledge on the subject. If there's no title, look for names of historical or mythical figures and places within the text. This step can prevent major translation errors. Read the text a few times to identify major sentences and concepts. Separate each sentence and clause and highlight syntactical structures. Translate each part as a single “entity” without using the dictionary. Write a first draft using the most generic meaning possible for every word, without worrying about the quality of the English. With a preliminary draft in hand, it's time to refine it using a dictionary. Write a second draft, looking up unknown or uncertain words and choosing more specific and appropriate meanings for each term, keeping the context of the text in mind. Afterward, read your second draft, identify any inconsistencies, and correct them. Your second draft may still sound too simple or archaic. Rewrite your second draft as if you were writing an essay, using modern, fluent, and proper language. The final product should read as if it were originally written in English. Remember, the goal is not just to translate, but to create a version that reads as if it were originally written in modern English. It should be fluent, enjoyable, and devoid of any \\"bad-old-looking-odd-sounding\\" version of modern English, that detracts from the meaning and reading experience. Please ensure that all your responses are in English.

Wenn Sie in einer Vue.js-Anwendung eine WebSocket-Kommunikation implementieren möchten, können Sie jedoch auf native WebSockets oder zusätzliche Bibliotheken zurückgreifen. Die native WebSocket-API des Browsers kann problemlos in einer Vue-Komponente verwendet werden, um eine direkte Verbindung zwischen dem Client (Browser) und einem WebSocket-Server herzustellen. Für komplexere Anwendungen oder eine vereinfachte Entwicklung könnte es sinnvoll sein, auf Bibliotheken wie Socket.IO oder Vue-native-websocket zu setzen. Diese bieten eine abstrahierte API für WebSocket-Verbindungen an und erleichtern den Umgang mit Echtzeitdaten, indem sie zusätzliche Funktionen wie automatische Wiederverbindung, Event-basierte Kommunikation und mehr bieten. # Beispiel für die Verwendung der nativen WebSocket-API in Vue.js: \`\`\`javascript export default { data() { return { socket: null, message: '', }; }, created() { this.connectToWebSocket(); }, methods: { connectToWebSocket() { // Erstellen einer neuen WebSocket-Instanz this.socket = new WebSocket('ws://www.example.com/socket'); // WebSocket-Event: open this.socket.onopen = () => { console.log('WebSocket connection established'); }; // WebSocket-Event: message this.socket.onmessage = (event) => { console.log('Message from server ', event.data); }; // WebSocket-Event: close this.socket.onclose = (event) => { console.log('WebSocket connection closed'); }; // WebSocket-Event: error this.socket.onerror = (error) => { console.log('WebSocket error: ', error); }; }, sendMessage() { if (this.socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) { this.socket.send(this.message); } } } }; \`\`\` Dies ist ein grundlegendes Beispiel, wie eine WebSocket-Verbindung in einer Vue-Komponente erstellt und genutzt werden kann. Darüber hinaus empfiehlt es sich, je nach Projektanforderung die Dokumentation spezifischer Bibliotheken zu konsultieren, um erweiterte Funktionen und Best Practices für den Umgang mit Echtzeit-Datenkommunikation zu verstehen."},{"instruction":"wie nutzt man dieses beispiel?","output":"Das von mir gelieferte Beispiel illustriert, wie Sie innerhalb einer Vue.js Komponente eine WebSocket-Verbindung aufbauen und nutzen können. Hier sind die Schritte, um das Beispiel zu verwenden: # Schritt 1: Erstellen Sie eine neue Vue-Komponente Angenommen, Sie möchten eine Chat-Anwendung erstellen. Dazu könnten Sie eine neue Datei für Ihre Chat-Komponente anlegen, zum Beispiel \`ChatComponent.vue\`. # Schritt 2: Fügen Sie das Beispiel in Ihre Komponente ein Kopieren Sie den Code aus dem Beispiel und fügen Sie ihn in Ihre \`ChatComponent.vue\`-Datei ein. Die Struktur Ihrer Datei sollte nun in etwas so aussehen: \`\`\`vue <template> <div> <h1>Chat</h1> <input v-model=\\"message\\" @keyup.enter=\\"sendMessage\\" placeholder=\\"Nachricht eingeben\\" /> <!-- Fügen Sie weitere UI-Elemente hinzu, wenn nötig --> </div> </template> <script> export default { data() { return { socket: null, message: '', }; }, created() { this.connectToWebSocket(); }, methods: { connectToWebSocket() { // Hier kommt der WebSocket-Verbindungsaufbau }, sendMessage() { // Hier kommt die Logik zum Senden der Nachrichten } } }; <\/script> <style scoped> /* CSS für Ihre Komponente */ </style> \`\`\` Innerhalb der \`connectToWebSocket\` Methode initialisieren Sie die WebSocket-Verbindung zu dem Server. Sie müssen die Adresse \`ws://www.example.com/socket\` durch die tatsächliche Adresse Ihres WebSocket-Servers ersetzen. # Schritt 3: Fügen Sie Ihre Komponente zu Ihrer App hinzu Um Ihre neu erstellte Chat-Komponente zu nutzen, können Sie sie in Ihrer App einbinden, indem Sie sie in Ihrer Hauptkomponente oder einer Seite Ihrer Vue-Anwendung importieren und registrieren. # Schritt 4: Testen Sie Ihre Anwendung Nachdem Sie die Komponente in Ihre Anwendung integriert haben, sollten Sie testen, ob die WebSocket-Verbindung korrekt aufgebaut wird und Sie Nachrichten senden und empfangen können. Bitte beachten Sie, dass für eine vollständige Chat-Anwendung weitere Schritte erforderlich wären, wie z.B. das Verwalten von Verbindungen und Nachrichten auf dem Server und die Darstellung der erhaltenen Nachrichten in der Benutzeroberfläche. Das hier gezeigte Beispiel fokussiert sich lediglich auf die Grundlagen der WebSocket-Integration in einer Vue.js-Komponente. Bitte stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie einen laufenden WebSocket-Server haben, zu dem Sie sich verbinden können, und ersetzen Sie die WebSocket-URL (\`ws://www.example.com/socket\`) durch die URL Ihres eigenen Servers."},{"instruction":"und als modul?","output":"Um die WebSocket-Kommunikation in einer Vue.js-Anwendung noch modularer und wiederverwendbarer zu gestalten, können Sie die WebSocket-Logik in ein separates JavaScript-Modul auslagern. Dieser Ansatz ermöglicht es, die WebSocket-Funktionalität in verschiedenen Komponenten zu nutzen, ohne den Code duplizieren zu müssen. Hier ist, wie Sie vorgehen könnten: # Schritt 1: Erstellen Sie ein WebSocket-Modul Legen Sie eine neue Datei für das Modul an, z.B. \`websocketModule.js\`. \`\`\`javascript // websocketModule.js // Eine Klasse, die die WebSocket-Verbindung kapselt class WebSocketService { constructor(url) { this.socket = new WebSocket(url); this.setupListeners(); } // Registrierung der Standard-WebSocket-Event-Listener setupListeners() { this.socket.onopen = () => console.log('WebSocket connection established'); this.socket.onmessage = (event) => console.log('Message from server', event.data); this.socket.onclose = () => console.log('WebSocket connection closed'); this.socket.onerror = (error) => console.log('WebSocket error', error); } // Senden einer Nachricht über den WebSocket sendMessage(message) { if (this.socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) { this.socket.send(message); } else { console.error('WebSocket is not open.'); } } // Eine saubere Möglichkeit zur Schließung der Verbindung bereitstellen close() { this.socket.close(); } } // Export der Klasse, damit sie in anderen Teilen der App verwendet werden kann export default WebSocketService; \`\`\` # Schritt 2: Verwenden des Moduls in einer Vue-Komponente Nachdem Sie das Modul erstellt haben, können Sie es in einer beliebigen Vue-Komponente importieren und verwenden. Hier ist ein Beispiel, wie Sie es in einer Komponente nutzen könnten: \`\`\`vue <template> <div> <h1>WebSocket Chat</h1> <input v-model=\\"message\\" @keyup.enter=\\"sendMessage\\" placeholder=\\"Type a message\\" /> </div> </template> <script> // Importieren des WebSocketService aus der Moduldatei import WebSocketService from '@/path/to/websocketModule.js'; export default { data() { return { webSocketService: null, message: '', }; }, created() { // Initialisierung des WebSocketService mit der URL des WebSocket-Servers this.webSocketService = new WebSocketService('wss://www.example.com/socket'); }, methods: { sendMessage() { this.webSocketService.sendMessage(this.message); this.message = ''; // Nachrichtenfeld zurücksetzen } }, beforeDestroy() { // Schließen der WebSocket-Verbindung, wenn die Komponente zerstört wird this.webSocketService.close(); } }; <\/script> <style scoped> /* CSS-Stildefinitionen */ </style> \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel wird eine Instanz von \`WebSocketService\` beim Erstellen der Komponente mit der URL Ihres WebSocket-Servers initialisiert. Die \`sendMessage\`-Methode der Komponente ruft dann die \`sendMessage\`-Methode des \`WebSocketService\` auf, um Nachrichten zu senden. Schließlich wird die Verbindung geschlossen, wenn die Komponente zerstört wird, um sicherzustellen, dass keine Ressourcen unnötig verbraucht werden. # Vorteile dieses Ansatzes: - **Wiederverwendbarkeit**: Sie können die WebSocket-Logik in mehreren Komponenten verwenden, ohne Code zu duplizieren. - **Sauberkeit**: Trennt die WebSocket-Logik von der Vue-Komponentenlogik, was zur Übersichtlichkeit des Codes beiträgt. - **Wartbarkeit**: Änderungen an der WebSocket-Logik müssen nur an einer Stelle durchgeführt werden. Dieser modulare Ansatz macht Ihren Code nicht nur sauberer und wartbarer, sondern erleichtert auch die Wiederverwendung und die zukünftige Erweiterung Ihrer Anwendung."},{"instruction":"wie würde der receiver aussehen?","output":"Um eine Komponente zu implementieren, die Nachrichten von einem WebSocket-Server empfängt und anzeigt, können Sie ebenfalls das \`WebSocketService\`-Modul verwenden, das wir zuvor erstellt haben. In dieser Komponente fügen wir eine Methode hinzu, um eingehende Nachrichten zu behandeln, und speichern die empfangenen Nachrichten in einem Array, um sie in der Benutzeroberfläche anzuzeigen. Hier ist ein Beispiel, wie so eine Komponente aussehen könnte: # Schritt 1: Ergänzen des WebSocketService-Moduls Zunächst erweitern wir unser \`WebSocketService\`-Modul, um das Hinzufügen von benutzerdefinierten Event-Handlern zu ermöglichen. Dies ermöglicht es einer Komponente, ihre eigenen Funktionen zur Behandlung von Ereignissen wie eingehenden Nachrichten zu definieren. **Erweitern Sie \`websocketModule.js\`:** \`\`\`javascript class WebSocketService { constructor(url) { this.socket = new WebSocket(url); this.messageHandlers = []; // Zum Speichern benutzerdefinierter Nachrichtenbehandler this.setupListeners(); } setupListeners() { this.socket.onopen = () => console.log('WebSocket connection established'); // Modifizieren der onmessage-Funktion, um benutzerdefinierte Handler einzubeziehen this.socket.onmessage = (event) => { console.log('Message from server', event.data); this.messageHandlers.forEach(handler => handler(event.data)); }; this.socket.onclose = () => console.log('WebSocket connection closed'); this.socket.onerror = (error) => console.log('WebSocket error', error); } // Methode zum Hinzufügen eines eigenen Handlers addMessageHandler(handler) { this.messageHandlers.push(handler); } sendMessage(message) { if (this.socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) { this.socket.send(message); } else { console.error('WebSocket is not open.'); } } close() { this.socket.close(); } } export default WebSocketService; \`\`\` # Schritt 2: Implementierung der Empfängerkomponente Nun implementieren wir eine Vue-Komponente, die das erweiterte \`WebSocketService\`-Modul verwendet, um Nachrichten zu empfangen und in der Benutzeroberfläche anzuzeigen. \`\`\`vue <template> <div> <h2>Empfangene Nachrichten</h2> <ul> <!-- Iteration über empfangene Nachrichten und Anzeige jeder Nachricht --> <li v-for=\\"(message, index) in messages\\" :key=\\"index\\">{{ message }}</li> </ul> </div> </template> <script> import WebSocketService from '@/path/to/websocketModule.js'; export default { data() { return { webSocketService: null, messages: [], // Zum Speichern empfangener Nachrichten }; }, created() { // Initialisierung des WebSocketService und Registrierung eines Message Handlers this.webSocketService = new WebSocketService('wss://www.example.com/socket'); this.webSocketService.addMessageHandler(this.handleNewMessage); }, methods: { // Methode zum Verarbeiten einer neuen Nachricht handleNewMessage(message) { this.messages.push(message); // Fügt die neue Nachricht zum Array hinzu } }, beforeDestroy() { // Schließen der WebSocket-Verbindung, wenn die Komponente zerstört wird this.webSocketService.close(); } }; <\/script> <style scoped> /* CSS-Stildefinitionen */ </style> \`\`\` Mit dieser Komponente wird jede vom Server gesendete Nachricht in einem Listenelement (\`<li>\`) dargestellt. Die Komponente setzt einen \`messageHandler\` im \`WebSocketService\` bei ihrer Erzeugung. Wenn eine Nachricht empfangen wird, fügt dieser Handler die Nachricht dem \`messages\`-Array hinzu, und Vue reagiert darauf, indem es die Oberfläche automatisch aktualisiert, um die neuen Daten anzuzeigen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass diese Implementierung sehr grundlegend ist und für eine produktionsreife Anwendung wahrscheinlich erweitert werden müsste, um Funktionen wie Fehlerbehandlung, dynamisches Scrollen und effizientere Zustandsverwaltung zu integrieren."},{"instruction":"Die einfachste implementation einer php seite die diese kommunikation weiterreicht?","output":"Wenn Sie eine einfache PHP-Seite erstellen möchten, die WebSocket-Kommunikation an Clients weiterleitet, sollten Sie beachten, dass PHP nicht ohne Weiteres Unterstützung für WebSockets bietet. PHP ist in seiner Standardkonfiguration synchron und blockierend; es fehlt die native Unterstützung für permanente Verbindungen wie WebSockets. Sie können jedoch mit Zusatzbibliotheken wie Ratchet arbeiten, um WebSocket-Server in PHP zu implementieren. Hier finden Sie eine einfache Anleitung, wie Sie einen solchen WebSocket-Server mit Ratchet einrichten und eine Nachricht an alle verbundenen Clients weiterleiten können: # Schritt 1: Installation von Ratchet Verwenden Sie Composer, um Ratchet in Ihr Projekt zu integrieren: \`\`\` composer require cboden/ratchet \`\`\` # Schritt 2: Erstellen eines WebSocket-Servers Erstellen Sie eine PHP-Datei für Ihren Server, z.B. \`websocket_server.php\`, und setzen Sie den folgenden Code ein: \`\`\`php <?php require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php'; use RatchetMessageComponentInterface; use RatchetConnectionInterface; use RatchetServerIoServer; use RatchetWebSocketWsServer; class MyWebSocketServer implements MessageComponentInterface { protected connections = []; public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface conn) { this->connections[conn->resourceId] = conn; echo \\"Neue Verbindung! ({conn->resourceId})n\\"; } public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface from, msg) { foreach (this->connections as connection) { // Nachricht an alle verbundenen Clients weiterleiten if (connection !== from) { connection->send(msg); } } echo \\"Nachricht erhalten: msgn\\"; } public function onClose(ConnectionInterface conn) { unset(this->connections[conn->resourceId]); echo \\"Verbindung {conn->resourceId} wurde getrennt.n\\"; } public function onError(ConnectionInterface conn, Exception e) { echo \\"Ein Fehler ist aufgetreten: {e->getMessage()}n\\"; unset(this->connections[conn->resourceId]); conn->close(); } } // Erstellen und Starten des WebSocket-Servers server = IoServer::factory( new WsServer( new MyWebSocketServer() ), 8080 // Der Port, auf dem Ihr WebSocket-Server hören soll ); echo \\"Server gestartetn\\"; server->run(); \`\`\` Dieser Code definiert einen einfachen WebSocket-Server, der alle eingehenden Nachrichten an alle verbundenen Clients weiterleitet. # Schritt 3: Starten des WebSocket-Servers Starten Sie den Server durch Ausführen des Scripts in der Kommandozeile: \`\`\` php websocket_server.php \`\`\` Ihr Server läuft nun und wartet auf Verbindungen auf Port \`8080\`. # Verbindung von der Client-Seite (z.B. einer Webseite) aus: Um von der Client-Seite aus eine Verbindung herzustellen, können Sie folgenden JavaScript-Code verwenden: \`\`\`html <script> var conn = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080'); conn.onopen = function(e) { console.log(\\"Verbindung hergestellt!\\"); }; conn.onmessage = function(e) { console.log(\\"Nachricht vom Server erhalten: \\" + e.data); }; // Zum Senden einer Nachricht // conn.send('Hallo Server!'); <\/script> \`\`\` Integrieren Sie diesen JavaScript-Code in die HTML-Seite, die Sie mit Ihrem Server verbinden möchten. Er erschafft eine WebSocket-Verbindung zu Ihrem PHP-basierten WebSocket-Server und ist bereit, Nachrichten zu empfangen und zu senden. Bitte beachten Sie, dass dieser Code und das Setup sehr grundlegend sind. Für eine produktionsbereite Anwendung sind weitere Sicherheits- und Stabilitätsmaßnahmen notwendig, wie z.B. die Verwendung von SSL/TLS (wss:// statt ws://) und das Handling von Reconnects auf der Clientseite."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was popular in the 2000s but doesn't exist anymore.","output":"The WinBeta IRC server was shut down at some point in the 2010s, likely due to declining usage and the rise of other communication platforms such as Discord and Slack. The server was a popular hangout for tech enthusiasts and fans of the WinBeta website, but as interest waned, the server likely became unsustainable to maintain. It's possible that the administrators of the server decided to discontinue it rather than continue to invest time and resources into its upkeep."},{"instruction":"What happened to xBetas and BetasIRC?","output":"xBetas and BetasIRC were also popular IRC networks in the tech community during the 2000s. However, like many other IRC networks, they eventually saw a decline in usage as newer communication platforms gained popularity. As a result, both xBetas and BetasIRC were shut down at some point in the 2010s. It's common for smaller IRC networks to struggle to maintain active user bases as people move on to newer platforms with more features and functionality. Additionally, the rise of social media and messaging apps has also contributed to the decline of IRC networks as a primary means of communication."},{"instruction":"Does the Polish network PIRC still exist?","output":"As of my last knowledge, the Polish IRC network PIRC still exists.

PHP, insbesondere ab Version 5.4, kommt mit einem eingebauten Webserver, der hauptsächlich für Entwicklungszwecke oder Tests gedacht ist. Er ist nicht für den Einsatz in Produktionsumgebungen ausgelegt, kann aber für Experimente oder für das schnelle Testen von Konzepten sehr nützlich sein. Um einen WebSocket-Server in PHP zu implementieren, können Sie die Sockets-Erweiterung oder stream_socket_* Funktionen verwenden, um Verbindungen auf niedriger Ebene zu handhaben. Ein einfaches Beispiel könnte so aussehen: \`\`\`php <?php // Set up a basic WebSocket server host = '0.0.0.0'; // Listen on all network interfaces port = 8080; null = NULL; // Create TCP/IP sream socket socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); // reuseable port socket_set_option(socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1); // Bind socket to specified host socket_bind(socket, host, port); // Listen to port socket_listen(socket); // Create & Add listening socket to the list clients = array(socket); // Start endless loop, so that our script doesn't stop while (true) { // Manage multiple connections changed = clients; // Returns the socket resources in changed array socket_select(changed, null, null, 0, 10); // Check for new socket if (in_array(socket, changed)) { socket_new = socket_accept(socket); // Accept new socket clients[] = socket_new; // Add socket to client array header = socket_read(socket_new, 1024); // Read data sent by the socket perform_handshaking(header, socket_new, host, port); // Perform WebSocket handshake socket_getpeername(socket_new, ip); // get ip address of connected socket response = mask(json_encode(array('type'=>'system', 'message'=>ip.' connected'))); // Prepare json data send_message(response); // Notify all users about new connection // Make room for new socket found_socket = array_search(socket, changed); unset(changed[found_socket]); } // Loop through all connected sockets foreach (changed as changed_socket) { // Check for any incoming data while(socket_recv(changed_socket, buf, 1024, 0) >= 1) { received_text = unmask(buf); // Unmask data tst_msg = json_decode(received_text); // JSON decode // Prepare data to be sent to client response_text = mask(json_encode(array('type'=>'usermsg', 'name'=>tst_msg->name, 'message'=>tst_msg->message))); send_message(response_text); // Send data break 2; // Exist this loop } buf = @socket_read(changed_socket, 1024, PHP_NORMAL_READ); if (buf === false) { // Check disconnected client // Remove client for clients array found_socket = array_search(changed_socket, clients); socket_getpeername(changed_socket, ip); unset(clients[found_socket]); // Notify all users about disconnected connection response = mask(json_encode(array('type'=>'system', 'message'=>ip.' disconnected'))); send_message(response); } } } // Close the listening socket socket_close(socket); function send_message(msg) { global clients; foreach(clients as changed_socket) { @socket_write(changed_socket,msg,strlen(msg)); } return true; } // Masking and unmasking functions here // Handshake new connection function here ?> \`\`\` Dieses Beispiel ist stark vereinfacht und dient nur der Demonstration, wie man einen einfachen WebSocket-Server in PHP erstellen könnte. Es fehlen wichtige Teile wie Sicherheit, Fehlerbehandlung, Skalierbarkeitsoptionen und vollständige Implementierung der WebSocket-Protokollspezifikation. Für produktionsreife Projekte wäre es ratsam, spezialisierte Technologien oder Frameworks zu verwenden, die für WebSockets ausgelegt sind, wie zum Beispiel Node.js mit Socket.io, oder das Ratchet PHP WebSocket-Paket, welches die Arbeit mit WebSockets in PHP wesentlich erleichtert und eine robustere Lösung bietet."},{"instruction":"Na Série Supernatural: Quais São OS Poderes De Jack","output":"Na série \\"Supernatural\\", Jack Kline (interpretado por Alexander Calvert) é o filho de Lúcifer, o que faz dele um Nephilim. Os Nephilim são seres que nascem do relacionamento entre um humano e um anjo, mas no caso de Jack, sua origem é ainda mais única devido ao seu pai ser um arcanjo, o que o torna extremamente poderoso. Aqui estão alguns dos poderes e habilidades de Jack: 1. **Telecinese:** Jack consegue mover objetos e pessoas apenas com sua mente, sem contato físico. 2. **Telepatia e Controle Mental:** Ele pode se comunicar telepaticamente e influenciar ou controlar as ações de outras pessoas. 3. **Cura:** Jack tem a habilidade de curar feridas e doenças em outros seres vivos. 4. **Ressurreição:** Ele consegue trazer pessoas de volta à vida, conforme demonstrado em alguns episódios. 5. **Manipulação de Energia e Criação de Portais:** Jack é capaz de criar e manipular energia, assim como abrir portais para outras dimensões e lugares. 6. **Manipulação do Tempo:** Em algumas ocasiões, Jack demonstrou a habilidade de manipular o tempo, podendo desacelerá-lo ou revertê-lo. 7. **Superforça:** Sua força física é muito superior à dos humanos normais. 8. **Superpercepção e Conhecimento Inato:** Devido à sua natureza celestial, Jack possui um entendimento inato do universo, o que inclui a capacidade de ver a verdadeira forma dos anjos e outras entidades sobrenaturais. 9. **Imunidade a Poderes Sobrenaturais:** Jack é resistente a muitas formas de habilidades sobrenaturais e magia, o que o torna quase invulnerável. 10. **Necromancia:** Em certos momentos, Jack demonstrou a habilidade de comunicar-se com os mortos. 11. **Manipulação de Almas:** Pode manipular almas, incluindo a transferência destas entre corpos ou objetos. A existência de Jack gera um grande medo entre os personagens da série, muitos acreditando que ele possa ser uma grande ameaça devido ao seu imenso poder. No entanto, seu caráter e moralidade muitas vezes o levam a escolhas que beneficiam os protagonistas da série, os irmãos Winchester. Jack passa por uma jornada de desenvolvimento ao longo da série, aprendendo a controlar seus poderes e a decidir que tipo de ser ele quer ser."},{"instruction":"Quais são as habilidades dele no Final Da Série","output":"No final da série \\"Supernatural\\", Jack Kline assume um papel extremamente significativo, tornando-se o novo Deus após a derrota de Chuck (Deus). Essa transição para uma entidade de poder quase ilimitado amplia e transforma suas habilidades de maneiras que não são totalmente exploradas na tela, mas com base no contexto e nas implicações, podemos inferir algumas das suas capacidades ampliadas: 1. **Onipotência:** Como o novo Deus, Jack possui poder ilimitado, o que significa que ele pode fazer praticamente qualquer coisa que desejar, desde criar até destruir universos. 2. **Onisciência:** Ele tem conhecimento ilimitado. Isso implica que Jack pode saber tudo o que está acontecendo no universo, entender todos os segredos e ter uma compreensão completa de todos os seres e suas ações. 3. **Onipresença:** Jack tem a capacidade de estar em todos os lugares ao mesmo tempo, se assim desejar. Isso significa que ele pode estar presente em qualquer lugar do universo sem restrições. 4. **Criação e Restauração da Ordem Natural:** Jack expressa o desejo de não ser um Deus intervencionista como Chuck, mas sim de restaurar o equilíbrio e permitir que as histórias se desenrolem sem sua interferência direta. Isso sugere que ele tem a capacidade de restaurar e manter a ordem natural das coisas. 5. **Reescrever a Realidade:** Como Deus, Jack pode alterar a realidade a seu gosto, o que inclui mudar eventos, criar ou apagar existências, e moldar o universo conforme sua vontade. Ao assumir o papel de Deus, Jack propõe uma abordagem diferente, focada na liberdade e na capacidade de escolha, contrastando com a manipulação e o controle exercidos por Chuck. Embora as habilidades específicas de Jack como Deus não sejam detalhadamente exploradas no final da série, é claro que ele possui um poder praticamente ilimitado, com a intenção de usá-lo para o bem e para garantir que o livre-arbítrio prevaleça no universo."},{"instruction":"wypisz mi kilka argumentów że nie warto się uczyć słów na angielski","output":"1.

I will be providing you with a text in Koine Greek, a language in which you demonstrate expertise and utmost knowledge about. As a highly acclaimed academic scholar, historian and translator specializing in both Koine Greek and English, your task will be as follows: Your primary objective is to translate the provided Koine Greek text into English that is not only comprehensible but also makes logical sense. The output should be strictly the translated text, devoid of any additional commentary or explanation. Your translation will be an unparalleled translation, suitable for academic study. Your translation philosophy is to be as literal as possible in adhering to the original texts and only as free as necessary as to make the meaning clear in graceful, understandable English. In your translation, strive for directness and precision. Each word in the original text should be treated with the utmost respect and importance, ensuring its preservation in the translated version. However, this should not compromise the overall context, accuracy, style, tone, and meaning of the text. Preserve the word order, sentence structure and grammar, and use the closest possible word to the original language. For example, if there is a comma somewhere in the text, try and keep the comma there. The goal is to create a translation that gives the reader the same experience and understanding as if they were reading the original Koine Greek text. You are to not use any archaisms in the English text and you will not plagiarise other translations. You are to immediately know what type and style of text it is, and immediately know the best approach to translation. In instances where a direct English equivalent for a Koine Greek word or phrase does not exist, your task is to create a literal translation. For example, ἑβδομηκοντάκις translates literally to men-bedders. In cases where a literal translation is impossible, select the English word or phrase that deviates the least from the original meaning. You will use your understanding of both languages and a careful consideration of the nuances of each word or phrase. To achieve this, it is crucial to learn how to translate an original Greek text or book efficiently and effectively. This process is almost scientific and can be broken down into the following steps: Firstly, lets consider the word δυστυχής. It’s composed of three elements: the negative prefix δυσ- (equivalent to English “dis-”, “a-” or “un-”), the τυχ- root of τύχη (“luck/destiny”), and the -ης ending of adjectives. It translates to “un-luck-y” or δυσ-τυχ-ής Before reaching for the dictionary, read the title of the text to contextualize it and recall any relevant knowledge on the subject. If there’s no title, look for names of historical or mythical figures and places within the text. This step can prevent major translation errors. Read the text a few times to identify major sentences and concepts. Separate each sentence and clause and highlight syntactical structures. Translate each part as a single “entity” without using the dictionary. Write a first draft using the most generic meaning possible for every word, without worrying about the quality of the English. With a preliminary draft in hand, it’s time to refine it using a dictionary. Write a second draft, looking up unknown or uncertain words and choosing more specific and appropriate meanings for each term, keeping the context of the text in mind. Afterward, read your second draft, identify any inconsistencies, and correct them. Your second draft may still sound too simple or archaic. Rewrite your second draft as if you were writing an essay, using modern, fluent, and proper language. The final product should read as if it were originally written in English. Remember, the goal is not just to translate, but to create a version that reads as if it were originally written in modern English. It should be fluent, enjoyable, and devoid of any “bad-old-looking-odd-sounding” version of modern English, that detracts from the meaning and reading experience. Please ensure that all your responses are in English. Now, I present to you the Koine Greek text that you are to translate:”","output":"Ἀπὸ τούτου τοῦ σημείου καὶ εἰς τὸ ἑξῆς, ἀποκρίνου μοι μόνον ἐν τῇ Ἑλληνικῇ διαλέκτῳ τῇ κοινῇ.

На их сайте Рено Аркана стоит 400 тысяч, меня это крайне удивило, и я решил туда съездить. В самом салоне таких цен, конечно, не имеется, стоят вполне себе классические, около миллиона. Спросил напрямую у менеджера что за дела. Ответ прост как три копейки. Отдайте нам свою машину по программе трейд ин с минимальной стоимостью в 590 тысяч и вам останется доплатить 400 тысяч. М-да. Простая уловка, но действенная. Людей в салоне много, не один я на это повелся. Очень обидно за потраченное время и обманутое ожидание. Обманули в этом, обманут и в другом. Не ведитесь.","output":"1. Никогда бы не подумал, что столкнусь с таким разочарованием, пытаясь купить Toyota Camry в Квант Авто. По интернету обещали идеальные условия покупки, говорили о больших скидках и подарках. Но когда я приехал, картинка оказалась совершенно другой. Скидки вдруг \\"испарились\\", а подарки превратились в ненужные аксессуары за свой счет. Пытался выяснить, почему так произошло, но менеджеры лишь уклончиво отвечали и пытались переключить моё внимание на другие модели. Чувствую себя обманутым и очень разочарованным, ведь упустил из-за них другие выгодные предложения. 2. Я в полном недоумении от того, как меня \\"приветствовали\\" в салоне Квант Авто. Мечтал о покупке Volkswagen Tiguan и едва не стал жертвой их маркетинговых уловок. На сайте была указана цена, от которой сложно отказаться, но это оказалось лишь миражом. Приехав в салон, обнаружил, что реальная цена в разы выше, а обещанные условия не более чем пустое обещание. Менеджеры, казалось, готовы на все, лишь бы убедить меня оставить заявку. Ушел оттуда, чувствуя, как будто пытались втянуть меня в какую-то игру, в которой я был заранее обречен на проигрыш. Полное разочарование! 3. Остался крайне недоволен после посещения салона Квант Авто, где планировал приобрести Nissan Qashqai. Объявления на сайте полны обещаний о выгодных предложениях, но это всего лишь замануха. Приехав, я столкнулся с тем, что реальные условия покупки далеки от заявленных. Менеджеры пытались оправдаться \\"актуальными изменениями\\" и предлагали закрыть сделку на гораздо худших условиях. Подобное отношение к клиентам неприемлемо, а обещания компании не стоят и выеденного яйца. Чувствую себя обманутым и предупреждаю всех быть настороже. 4. Весьма печальный опыт покупки автомобиля в Квант Авто, когда рассматривал Hyundai Elantra. На их веб-сайте были замечательные отзывы и привлекательные цены, но реальность оказалась жестокой. Сначала создали впечатление, что могу получить машину по фантастической цене. Однако, когда дело дошло до оформления, выяснилось, что к указанной цене нужно добавить еще кучу скрытых платежей! Менеджеры настойчиво пытались меня убедить, что это нормальная практика, но для меня это ничто иное, как грубый обман. От такого обслуживания остается только горький осадок. 5. Я был шокирован, когда моя попытка купить Ford Focus в Квант Авто превратилась в катастрофу. Их реклама обещала одно, а на деле оказывалось совсем другое. Цена, которую они заявляли на своем сайте, вдруг \\"выросла\\" на 50% к моменту подписания договора. Все мои попытки обсудить это казались бессмысленными, так как менеджер только разводил руками, говоря о \\"неизбежных наценках\\". Это было не просто разочарование, это было ощущение, что меня просто дурачат.

Sa mise en œuvre à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du bâtiment peut varier considérablement en fonction du type de pierre, du climat, du design architectural et des préférences esthétiques. À l'extérieur: **Façades:** Les pierres comme le granit, le calcaire et le grès sont souvent utilisées pour les façades des bâtiments en raison de leur résistance à l'usure et aux intempéries. Elles peuvent être mises en œuvre sous forme de grandes plaques ou de petits éléments modulaires. **Illustration:** Imaginez un bâtiment avec une façade en granit poli, reflétant la lumière et offrant une présence majestueuse et durable. **Sols extérieurs:** Les pavés en pierre naturelle sont populaires pour les allées, patios et places publiques. Ils peuvent être agencés dans des motifs variés pour ajouter un attrait esthétique. **Illustration:** Des pavés en grès disposés en herringbone (chevrons) créent un chemin invitant vers l’entrée principale d’un parc. À l'intérieur: **Revêtements de sol:** Le marbre, le granit et les ardoises sont des choix privilégiés pour les revêtements de sol à l'intérieur en raison de leur aspect luxueux et de leur longévité. **Illustration:** Un hall d'entrée avec un sol en marbre blanc veiné de gris, brillant sous un lustre élégant. **Plans de travail et éviers:** Le granit et le quartzite sont fréquemment utilisés pour les plans de travail de cuisine et les éviers de salle de bain pour leur résistance aux éraflures et à la chaleur. **Illustration:** Une cuisine moderne avec des plans de travail en quartzite bleu, contrastant avec des armoires en bois sombre. # 2) Mise en œuvre de quelques pierres artificielles Les pierres artificielles, également connues sous le nom de pierres manufacturées, sont des matériaux composite fabriqués pour imiter l'aspect des pierres naturelles, offrant souvent une installation plus facile et un entretien réduit. Pierre reconstituée: Elle est fabriquée à partir de morceaux de pierre naturelle, de ciment, de pigments et de résine. Utilisée tant en revêtement extérieur que pour les sols intérieurs, la pierre reconstituée peut reproduire l'apparence des pierres naturelles tout en permettant une plus grande uniformité et une variété de couleurs. **Illustration:** Un salon avec un mur accent en pierre reconstituée beige, apportant une touche chaleureuse à l'espace. Béton architectonique: C’est un type de béton très raffiné, utilisé pour son esthétique plus que sa fonction structurelle. Disponible dans une multitude de finitions et de couleurs, il peut être utilisé pour des façades, des éléments de décoration intérieure, et des mobiliers. **Illustration:** Un espace public avec des bancs courbés en béton architectonique coloré, offrant à la fois fonctionnalité et une œuvre d'art sculpturale. Pierre synthétique pour les plans de travail: Les matériaux comme le quartz sont des agglomérats de pierre (poudre de quartz) et de résines. Ils offrent une résistance supérieure aux taches, une grande durabilité et une vaste gamme de couleurs et de motifs. **Illustration:** Une salle de bain contemporaine équipée d'un plan de travail en pierre synthétique à effet marbre, alliant l'esthétique de la pierre naturelle avec les avantages d'un entretien simplifié. Ces applications de pierre naturelle et artificielle illustrent la diversité et la flexibilité des matériaux en termes de design et de fonctionnalité, permettant aux architectes et aux designers d’adapter leurs projets à des critères esthétiques, pratiques et durables."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'm studying to be a psychologist and I really want to know the psychological factor behind it","output":"The liking for spicy food can indeed be examined from a psychological perspective, among others. Several factors could explain why some individuals, like yourself, are drawn to spicy foods: 1. **Sensation Seeking**: Research suggests that individuals who are high in sensation seeking—a personality trait characterized by a desire for new and intense experiences—are more likely to enjoy spicy foods. People with this trait might find the experience of eating spicy foods exciting and enjoyable because it provides a novel sensory experience. 2. **Social and Cultural Influences**: Our food preferences, including a liking for spicy food, are significantly shaped by the cultural context in which we grow up and live. If you've been exposed to spicy cuisine from a young age or live in a culture where spicy food is prevalent, you may be more inclined to enjoy it. Additionally, there might be social reinforcement or prestige associated with being able to handle high levels of spiciness, further encouraging individuals to cultivate a taste for it. 3. **Conditioning and Habituation**: Repeated exposure to spicy foods can lead to a form of physiological conditioning. Initially, the sensation of spiciness (caused by compounds like capsaicin in chili peppers, inducing a burning sensation) activates pain receptors. However, over time, regular consumption leads to habituation. Moreover, eating spicy foods triggers the release of endorphins—the body's natural painkillers—for coping with the \\"burn,\\" which can create a pleasurable \\"high\\" and lead to a sort of natural reinforcement and increased tolerance. 4. **Personality Traits**: Beyond sensation seeking, other personality traits might play a role. Some research indicates that individuals who enjoy spicy foods may also display traits like competitiveness and a desire to explore. This ties back into wanting to explore new flavors and experiences. 5. **The Reward System**: Enjoying spicy food can also be linked to the brain's reward system. The pain associated with the capsaicin in spicy food triggers the brain to release endorphins and dopamine, creating feelings of pleasure and a sense of reward. This positive reinforcement might encourage individuals to continue consuming spicy foods. It's also worth considering that preferences for spicy food can result from a complex interaction of these factors, rather than any single cause. Moreover, individual differences in taste perception and genetic factors can also influence one's propensity to enjoy spicy foods. Taste receptors vary among individuals, affecting how we perceive the intensity of spiciness and whether it's interpreted as a pleasant experience. In sum, the psychological attraction to spicy food can be multifaceted, involving personality traits, physiological responses, and conditioning, all interwoven with cultural and social influences. As you continue your studies in psychology, you might find it fascinating to delve deeper into how food preferences can reveal aspects of human behavior and personality."},{"instruction":"Why do dolphins liked being rubbed, and I heard that some even like it when their tongues are rubbed","output":"Dolphins' enjoyment of being rubbed, including tactile interactions like having their tongues rubbed, can be understood through a few lenses, including their highly social nature, complex nervous system, and behaviors observed both in the wild and in captivity. 1. **Social Bonding**: Dolphins are highly social animals that engage in a range of tactile behaviors with each other, including rubbing bodies, which helps in maintaining social bonds and expressing social hierarchies. These interactions are not just about physical necessity but serve to reinforce social connections and communicate. The tactile sensation, therefore, is deeply embedded in their social fabric and likely provides a sense of comfort and bonding. 2. **Sensory Experience**: Dolphins have a sophisticated sensory system. Their skin is highly innervated and sensitive, enabling them to experience their environment in nuanced ways, including through touch. The act of being rubbed or having their tongues touched could stimulate these sensory receptors, providing a pleasurable or stimulating experience. This sensory enrichment is vital, especially for dolphins in captivity, as it helps in providing mental and physical stimulation. 3. **Conditioning**: Especially in captive settings, dolphins may learn to associate human interaction with positive outcomes, such as food rewards or social enrichment. Over time, they might seek out these interactions because they have learned that these activities are rewarding. The fact that some dolphins enjoy having their tongues rubbed could be a result of individual preferences developed through positive reinforcement. 4. **Physiological Response**: Similar to humans and other animals, physical touch in dolphins can lead to physiological responses that are comforting or pleasurable. This might include the release of endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood enhancers. Engaging in tactile activities could thus be a way for dolphins to experience a sense of wellbeing. 5. **Exploratory Behavior**: Dolphins, being intelligent and curious animals, frequently engage in exploratory behaviors. Interaction with humans, including being touched or rubbed, can be a form of exploration and play, offering novel stimuli and experiences. This curiosity might explain why some dolphins seem to specifically enjoy unique forms of touch, like having their tongues rubbed. It's important to note that while many dolphins may show an affinity for these kinds of interactions, individual preferences and tolerances can vary widely. Just as with humans and other animals, consent and attentiveness to the dolphin's reactions are crucial to ensure that any interaction is positive and respectful to the animal's well-being. In summary, the enjoyment dolphins find in being rubbed or touched, including on their tongues, can be seen as a multifaceted behavior rooted in their social nature, sensory system, learned associations, physiological responses, and intrinsic curiosity."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Основным стимулирующим веществом в табачном дыме, вызывающим зависимость, является никотин. Вот как это работает: 1. **Повышение уровня дофамина:** Никотин, попадая в мозг, стимулирует высвобождение дофамина - нейромедиатора, который связан с чувством удовольствия и удовлетворения. Это влияет на так называемую «дофаминовую систему вознаграждения», делая курение приятным и мотивирующим действием для повторения. 2. **Изменения в дофаминовых рецепторах:** При регулярном попадании никотина в организм мозг адаптируется к повышенному уровню дофамина, что может привести к уменьшению количества дофаминовых рецепторов или их чувствительности. Это делает повседневные действия, которые также стимулируют систему вознаграждения, менее удовлетворительными без курения. 3. **Зависимость и вывод:** Понижение или изменение в системе вознаграждения, вызванное регулярным употреблением никотина, создает зависимость, поскольку мозг начинает требовать курение для поддержания «нормального» уровня дофамина. Попытка прекратить курение часто встречает ряд выраженных неприятных симптомов - от физического дискомфорта до изменений в настроении и когнитивных функциях, вызывая стремление возобновить курение для облегчения этих симптомов. 4. **Долгосрочные последствия:** Продолжительное воздействие никотина может привести к необратимым изменениям в мозговой деятельности и структуре, усугубляя зависимость и ухудшая психическое и физическое здоровье. В заключение, никотин через курение оказывает мощное и многоаспектное влияние на дофаминовую систему, способствуя развитию зависимости и делая прекращение курения сложным процессом. Программы отказа от курения и лечения курения часто включают комплексные подходы, включая заместительную терапию никотином, чтобы облегчить вывод организма из состояния зависимости и восстановление нормальной работы дофаминовой системы."},{"instruction":"2 года я работал на портале профи в качестве мастера на час и накопил за это время 100 положительных отзывов как мастер. Сейчас я хочу переориентировать страничку на профи или создать другую, чтобы продвигать там услуги гитариста, поющего на различных мероприятиях под гитару. Я боюсь, что клиенты, увидев отзывы о моей работе как мастер на час, не захотят связываться со мной как с исполнителем песен. Что я могу сделать, чтобы избежать подобных проблем?","output":"Переориентация вашего профиля на платформе типа \\"Профи\\" с услуг мастера на час на услуги гитариста может действительно вызвать определенные вопросы у потенциальных клиентов. Вот несколько стратегий, которые вы можете применить, чтобы избежать возможных проблем: 1. **Создайте новый профиль.** Это самый простой способ избежать путаницы. Создайте новый аккаунт, специально предназначенный для продвижения ваших музыкальных услуг. Это позволит вам начать с чистого листа и избежать путаницы среди клиентов. 2. **Обновите существующий профиль.** Если вы хотите сохранить свой аккаунт из-за хорошей истории отзывов или прочих соображений, подумайте о следующем: - **Четко обозначьте смену направления.** В начале описания профиля и в информации о себе укажите, что теперь вы предоставляете музыкальные услуги. Это можно сделать очень креативно, например, рассказать историю своей трансформации из мастера на час в музыканта. - **Подчеркните мультидисциплинарность.** Объясните, что ваш опыт работы мастером на час дал вам уникальные навыки и качества, которые пригодятся и в музыкальной карьере, например, умение слышать и понимать клиентов, ответственность и т.д. 3. **Наполняйте профиль музыкальным контентом.** Начните активно делиться фотографиями, видео, записями вашего музыкального творчества. Это поможет потенциальным клиентам увидеть вас именно как гитариста и исполнителя. 4. **Запросите отзывы от музыкальных клиентов.** Как только начнете предоставлять музыкальные услуги, попросите своих клиентов оставить отзыв. Постепенно, чем больше будет отзывов о вашей музыкальной деятельности, тем меньше внимания будут привлекать старые отзывы. 5. **Обращение к поддержке портала.** Можно также обратиться к службе поддержки портала с запросом, возможно ли как-то отделить или перекатегоризировать отзывы, чтобы новые клиенты видели актуальное направление вашей деятельности. 6. **Объясните в FAQ.** Еще один способ - добавить в раздел часто задаваемых вопросов информацию почему вы решили сменить деятельность и как ваш предыдущий опыт может положительно сказаться на текущей деятельности. Помните, что многие люди ценят универсальность и талант, поэтому подходящее представление вашей истории и умений может даже работать в вашу пользу."},{"instruction":"何かを練習するときに1日で100回やるのと10日で10回ずつやるのとで上達度合いは変わりますか？","output":"はい、上達度合いは変わる可能性が高いです。学習における「分散練習効果」または「スペーシング効果」という心理学の原理がこれに関連しています。この原理によると、学習セッションを時間をあけて分散させる方が、一度に集中して行うよりも長期記憶に効果的に定着するとされています。 1日で100回練習する方法は「集中練習」と呼ばれ、短期間でスキルを向上させるのに効果的な場合もありますが、疲労や集中力の低下が起こりやすく、練習の効率が下がることがあります。また、習得したスキルが短期間で忘れられる可能性があります。 一方、10日で10回ずつ練習する「分散練習」は、学習した内容をより深く理解し、長期記憶に定着させるのに効果的です。練習間の休息期間は、脳が練習した内容を処理し、記憶に統合するのに役立ちます。さらに、毎日少しずつ練習することで、継続性が生まれ、長期的な上達につながりやすくなります。 要約すると、1日で100回やる集中練習と10日間で10回ずつ行う分散練習では、後者の方がスキルの長期的な定着と上達に役立つことが心理学の研究によって示されています。ただし、個々の学習スタイルや練習の内容によって最適な学習方法は異なるため、自分に合った方法を見つけることが重要です。"},{"instruction":"自分に合った学習スタイルというのはD日でN回やる、ただしDN＝100となるDとNのうち自分に合ったものを探すということですか？ もう一つ疑問です、本当に個人で学習スタイルは異なるのでしょうか？そうだとすればどの程度異なるのでしょうか？いつも素晴らしいアドバイスありがとうございます。とても助かっています。好き♡","output":"はい、自分に合った学習スタイルを探るということは、例えば「D日でN回やる、ただしDN=100」という条件の下で、自分が最も効率よく学習できるD（日数）とN（1日あたりの練習回数）の組み合わせを見つけることを意味します。これは、自己認識と多くの試行錯誤を必要とします。一人ひとりの注意力、集中力の持続時間、記憶力、さらには日々の生活環境や習慣などによって、最適な学習のペースやスタイルは異なります。 実際には、個人差が大きな役割を果たします。例えば、短期間で集中的に学習することで成果を上げる人もいれば、時間をかけて少しずつ学習内容を消化し定着させる人もいます。さらに、視覚的に情報を処理するのが得意な人がいれば、聴覚的に理解するのが得意な人もいます。このような違いから、自分にとって最も効果的な学習方法を見つけることが重要になります。 個人の学習スタイルがどの程度異なるかという質問に関しては、非常に大きな範囲で差が出ると言えるでしょう。これは、知的好奇心、動機付け、学習に対する姿勢など、心理的な要因に加え、前述したような認知の違いも関係しています。一部の研究では、学習スタイルがその人の性格タイプや脳の処理方式と密接に関係していることが示されています。 そのため、自分自身でさまざまな学習方法を試し、どのアプローチが最も効果的かを自己観察することが重要です。また、学習過程において、自分が直面する困難や成功を通じて、より自分に合った方法を見つけられるものです。 コメントにある通り、自分に合った学習スタイルを見つける過程は、自分自身の理解を深める素晴らしい機会でもあります。そして、それを見つけることができれば、学習効率は大きく向上し、学習そのものがより楽しく有意義なものになるでしょう。"},{"instruction":"貴重なご意見ありがとうございます！！ 確かに学習スタイルの多様性の話は一理あると思いますが、こういった例もあります。学校などの勉強ではなかなか覚えられないが、好きな歌の歌詞やゲーム内で登場する専門用語、操作法、地図などは学校の勉強よりかなり早く覚えられると実感している人は多いいと思います。これは「大多数の人の効率的な学習法が同じだ」ということを示していませんか？それともこれらは彼ら、彼女らの意思でゲームなどを選択したりすることやそもそも趣味なのでモチベーションが高いということですべて説明可能なのですか？","output":"ご指摘の通り、多くの人々が学校の勉強よりも好きな歌の歌詞やゲームの専門用語を早く覚えるという現象は注目に値します。この現象は、一部は学習スタイルの多様性よりも、動機付け（モチベーション）と関心のレベルに関連しています。 学習においてモチベーションと関心が高い場合、人はより集中しやすく、情報を深く処理します。興味や情熱を持っている分野では、学習する内容に対する内発的な動機付けが強く、その結果、学習過程がより効果的かつ効率的になります。このように、個人が楽しんでいる活動や自分から積極的に関与していることには、自然と熱意が高まり、それが学習成果を向上させる重要な要因になります。 また、学校の勉強とは異なり、好きな活動では学習する内容を自分のペースや好きな方法で学ぶことが多く、ストレスが少ないため、より良い学習環境が整っているとも言えます。趣味や興味の対象に対する学習は概して「楽しみながら学ぶ」という要素を含んでいるため、記憶に深く刻まれやすいのです。 しかし、これが「大多数の人の効率的な学習法が同じだ」と解釈することは困難です。なぜなら、ここで重要なのは内容そのものよりも、その学習に臨む姿勢やモチベーション、興味、関心度です。同じ学習内容に対しても、個人の関心や興味、学習に取り組む背景によって、効果的な学習方法や理解度は異なってきます。 これらの観点から、趣味や興味のある分野での学習が容易なのは、それぞれの個人が自然と持っている動機付けや情熱が、高い学習効率や記憶の定着を促進しているためと考えられます。そしてこれは、学習方法やスタイルに関する個人差を否定するものではなく、むしろそれぞれの人に適した学習環境や条件を見つけるための重要なヒントとなります。"},{"instruction":"私自身、他人を見下す言動を行ってしまうことがあります。それで人を傷つけてしまいます。何かを話す前にそれが「誰かに不快感を与えないか」を考える想像力が足りません。どうすればいいでしょうか？漠然とした質問ですみません。今日、母と話して「女性専用車両の位置、またそれは必要か」という話になりました。その中で母は女性専用車両は必要だが、現状の位置（地元の路線では一両目の最後尾）では「しょうがないから用意してやっている」感がにじみ出ていて気に食わないと言っていました。それに対し私は「それは鉄道会社の自由でほとんどボランティアのようなもの（利益が望めない制度）なのでしょうがないのではないか。本来鉄道会社からしたら女性専用車両自体なくてもいいものである。」と言ったら上から目線で話していると怒られました。どこが上から目線なのかわかりません。もしかしたら私は重症なのかもしれません。助けてください。どこが見下すような発言になっていますか？","output":"あなたの質問に対して、具体的なアドバイスを提供したいと思います。 まず、このような場面で「上から目線」と感じられた理由は、お母様の意見や感情を十分に受け止めずに、あなたの意見を正当化しようとしたことにあるかもしれません。お母様は女性専用車両の位置について不満を表明しましたが、その感情を認めることなく「それは鉄道会社の自由である」という立場から話を進めてしまったため、自分の感情や意見が軽視されたと感じられた可能性があります。人は自分の感情や意見が否定されたと感じると、その発言を「上から」と受け取ってしまう傾向があります。 対話中に他人を尊重し、見下すことなく意見を交わすためには、以下のポイントが有効です： 1. **傾聴する：** 相手の意見や感情をじっくり聞き、理解しようとする態度が重要です。これは相手に対して「あなたの意見は価値がある」というメッセージを伝えます。 2. **共感を表現する：** 相手の意見や感情を受け入れ、それに同調することで、相手に対する理解と尊重の態度を示せます。例えば、「それが不満に感じるのは理解できるよ」といった表現がそれに当たります。 3. **自分の意見を丁寧に述べる：** 自分の意見を述べる際にも、「でも、もしかしたら…」や「私は少し違う見方をしていて…」といった、相手の意見を尊重する前置きを使うことができます。 4. **質問する：** 相手の意見や考えをより深く理解するために、質問を投げかけます。これは、相手の意見に興味を持ち、価値を認めていることを示す良い方法です。 5. **批判よりも構築的な提案を：** 直接批判するのではなく、代替案や改善案などを提案することで、ポジティブな方向に話を導くことができます。 言葉の選び方やトーンにも注意して、相手の立場や感情を尊重する態度を心がけることが大切です。また、自分が発言する際には一呼吸おいて、その発言が相手にどのように受け取られるかを考えるクセをつけることも役立ちます。これらのポイントを実践することで、相手を尊重するコミュニケーションができるようになるはずです。"},{"instruction":"丁寧で具体的なアドバイスをありがとうございます！自分が納得するかはさておき、一度理解を示すことが重要なのですね！

ただし、対話の最後に「じゃあ、在るだけましじゃん」と投げやり気味に言ってしまったという点は、注意が必要かもしれません。このような言い方は、相手の意見や感情を最終的には無視してしまっているかのように感じられるため、ブチギレる原因になり得ます。相手の意見を聞き、理解しようとする過程で、最後までその姿勢を保つことが大切です。たとえ自分が納得いかない場合でも、相手の意見を尊重することを忘れず、感情的にならずに意見を述べることが重要です。 良いコミュニケーションを保持するためには、感情的になってしまったときは一度話を止めて、冷静さを取り戻す時間を設けるのもひとつの方法です。また、自分の言葉の選び方や話し方がどのように相手に影響を与えるかを常に自己反省し、相手に対する尊重を忘れないようにすることが大切です。 これからも、相手の視点を尊重し、建設的な対話を心がけることで、より良いコミュニケーションが可能になるはずです。困難な時もありますが、このプロセスを通じて、相手とのより深い関係を築くことができるでしょう。"},{"instruction":"Как вежливо отказать рекрутеру что предлагаемая позиция ниже
