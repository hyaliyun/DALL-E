News article: New Jersey Professor Allegedly Ran Prostitution Website MADISON, N.J. – A longtime New Jersey physics professor who dabbled in scuba diving and harbored dreams of working in the theater had another hobby, New Mexico police say: operating a sophisticated prostitution website that may have catered to as many as 200 prostitutes and 1,200 clients. David Flory, 68, was arrested Sunday at a Starbucks in Albuquerque on 40 counts of promoting prostitution. The professor, who has taught at Farleigh Dickinson University since 1969, has a vacation home in New Mexico. A specialist in elementary particle theory, Flory also spent a decade in the school administration, where he said he spent time working on human resource database systems and measuring academic productivity -- skills that were evident from the three-tiered system police say he created for rating the privileges of johns who used the prostitution service. Flory, a married father of three according to his personal website, was being held on a 100,000 bond Tuesday. He didn't respond to an e-mail message. His wife didn't return a phone message left at the couple's New York apartment. Albuquerque Police Lt. William Roseman told The Associated Press that Flory's password-protected website, Southwest Companions, had been the subject of a vice investigation for the last six months after police received tips from prostitutes and johns. Roseman said the site had been in operation about three years and had about 1,400 members -- about 200 prostitutes and about 1,200 johns. Most of the members were in the Albuquerque-Santa Fe area, though some postings originated in Phoenix and Denver. Flory and his wife, Sharon, a psychotherapist specializing in eating disorders, live in an apartment on New York's Upper West Side, about 10 miles from the Fairleigh Dickinson campus. They have a vacation house in Santa Fe called Casa de Los Arboles, or \\"house of the trees.\\" The alleged prostitution site apparently didn't make a lot of money. \\"He said he was not in this for the money,\\" Roseman told the AP. \\"He flat-out told us his thing was he wanted to create a safe place for prostitutes and johns to get together. He called it a hobby.\\" Roseman said Flory \\"had dates set up\\" with the prostitutes when he came to New Mexico but couldn't say for sure what happened during those encounters. Police said the Southwest Companions website had three levels or ratings for johns: probation, verified and trust. \\"In order to get off probation you had to sleep with one of the prostitutes on the website and she in turn would tell the moderator (Flory) what acts occurred, how much they paid and any comments,\\" he said. \\"That opened you up to verified status. Once you got into verified status that opened you up to different girls available. Then, some would e-mail the moderator, \`This is the act, this is how much he paid, these are my comments about it.\\"' After so many of those, Roseman said, members moved into trusted status, which afforded access to features such as training videos on what do if you got caught by police. Members who reached the trusted level also could rate prostitutes. Samantha Agosto, a 21-year-old nursing student at FDU who had Flory as a tutor a few years ago, said she never found anything either odd or remarkable about him. \\"I never got that creepy vibe from him,\\" she said in a telephone interview. \\"He was very friendly and very willing to give of himself to help a student, very willing to give his time.\\" According to Flory's personal website, he has two daughters, a stepdaughter and four grandchildren. In an interview with a university publication in February, he said he is a certified scuba diver and also said he has considered attempting a career in theatrical lighting design, a pursuit he'd followed in high school and college. Referring to his time spent in the administration, he wrote on his website: \\"Now I spend a lot of my time working and playing with computer systems and software.\\" A Fairleigh Dickinson University spokeswoman said the school was saddened by the arrest, but did not say if Flory had been suspended from his job.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No Scarcity Of Suitors For Walter Reed Site The Pentagon's proposal to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Northwest Washington could touch off intense competition for a rare prize: more than 100 acres in a city where real estate values are soaring and space for new development is scarce. Barely a week after the Pentagon said it planned to close the 96-year-old hospital between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue, real estate brokers, D.C. planners, developers and politicians were laying claim to the property, a sign of the complicated discussions that ensue when the federal government pulls up stakes. The 113-acre complex is in the middle of an increasingly affluent neighborhood convenient to downtown and also is near the burgeoning commercial area of Silver Spring -- factors that argue for dense residential, retail or office development. But it is also a historic place, where war heroes and presidents have recuperated, and its redevelopment could trigger a preservation fight. And as a federal property, its decommissioning as a military hospital would be governed by tight restrictions, such as that the campus must first be offered to other government agencies. D.C. officials and neighborhood residents also would want a say. \\"What's attractive about Walter Reed is its size,\\" said Thomas R. Maskey, a senior vice president at Peterson Cos., a Northern Virginia developer of mixed-use projects. \\"There's not 113 acres anywhere around here that's going to be available. The size allows you to do a lot of different things that can really have an impact.\\" With congressional review of the Pentagon's base-closing plan ahead, it could be years before Walter Reed closes, and it may not happen at all if local officials succeed in blocking the proposed transfer of hospital staff to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda and Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County. And it could take years more before a plan for the property took shape. \\"There's a lot of legwork that has to be done before you can break ground and start redeveloping a site,\\" said Tim Ford, executive director of the Association of Defense Communities, a nonprofit group that tracks base closings and redevelopments across the country. \\"Just getting the land from the federal government is tough.\\" The Washington region is no stranger to the federal government rearranging its land use, but the aftermath isn't always consistent. The Cameron Station military base in Alexandria was quickly redeveloped into a mostly residential neighborhood after it was closed in the late 1990s. The District, in contrast, has been in a protracted debate over the fate of the federally operated and largely defunct St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Southeast. The 40-acre Southeast Federal Center was turned over to the District -- sort of. It is being redeveloped as a new headquarters for the Transportation Department, with some of the property slated for a private housing, retail and office development. Walter Reed, based on its size, history and location, would probably pose an even more complicated development problem. Ford said that when the military vacated its prime piece of real estate in San Francisco's Presidio, for example, there was a \\"constant battle\\" among residents, developers and D.C. officials before a compromise was reached to keep part of the 1,480-acre site as parkland and use other parts for commercial space. Developers said there would be no shortage of interest or ideas for the Walter Reed campus, which brokers said is worth 80 million to 100 million. Developer John Shooshan of Arlington, who has done office buildings and housing projects, said that because Walter Reed sits in a mostly residential area, bordering Rock Creek Park, it could be developed into a combination of single-family homes, condominiums and apartments. Summary:","output":"The Pentagon's proposal to close the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington has sparked interest from real estate brokers, developers and politicians, as the 113-acre site is situated in an increasingly affluent area near to downtown and Silver Spring. The size of the plot could allow for a range of developments, however, the historic nature of the site could trigger a preservation fight. Additionally, as a federal property, the campus would need to be offered to other government agencies first. The Pentagon's base-closing plan is still under congressional review, and it may be years before any development can take place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fold in half vertically with the arms together.","output":"In the next paragraph, we will explain the further steps for folding the shirt, as well as how to fold a long-sleeved shirt using this method. How to fold short-sleeve and long-sleeve shirts 1. Lay the shirt flat on a surface with the front side facing up. 2. If it's a short-sleeve shirt, fold the shirt in half vertically, aligning the sleeves together. For a long-sleeve shirt, fold each sleeve inward so that the cuffs are touching the bottom hem of the shirt. 3. Fold the shirt vertically once more, bringing the edge with the sleeves to meet the edge of the collar. 4. For short-sleeve shirts, you're done! Simply smooth out any wrinkles and stack the shirt neatly. For long-sleeve shirts, fold the sleeves over the top of the now-folded shirt, making sure they are aligned with the edges. 5. Finally, fold the long-sleeve shirt in half horizontally, matching the top edge (with the sleeves) to the bottom edge of the shirt. Smooth out any wrinkles and stack the shirt neatly. By following these steps, you can easily fold both short-sleeve and long-sleeve shirts using this simple method, which will keep your clothes organized and wrinkle-free."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The green tube is mentioned, but no context is given for whether it is part of the current scene or not. We need to evaluate the options that are related to the green tube and integrate it within the existing scenario. 3. Option a) seems negative, as it implies the green tube is stuck and not fully functional, which is contradictory to the overall leisure setting. 4. Option b) aligns with the current setting, where the green tube lands and the people are able to participate in the leisure activity of floating on the river. This option makes sense and maintains the tone of the scenario. 5. Option c) is again negative, as it implies an accident or misfortune for the people in the green tube. 6.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, what method is being used to study the early identification of dyslexia and reading difficulties in children?

Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. The Indian National Congress () (INC, often called Congress) is a broad-based political party in India. Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th-century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants. The Congress led India to independence from Great Britain, and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.  The Congress is a secular party whose social liberal platform is generally considered on the centre-left of Indian politics. The Congress' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya—the lifting up of all sections of society—which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. The party primarily endorses social liberalism — seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice, and secularism — asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings.  After India's independence in 1947, the Congress formed the government at center in most instances, and many regional state governments. Congress became India's dominant political party; , in the 15 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times, heading the central government for 49 years. There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–64), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004–14). Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014, it remains one of two major, nationwide, political parties in India, along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

Can we draw the following conclusion? Plants in soil are more nutritious Available options:  +Yes.  +It's impossible to say.  +No.","output":"It's impossible to say definitively that plants grown in soil are more nutritious across the board, as various factors can influence the nutritional value of a plant, regardless of the growing medium. In order to adequately address this question, let us explore some of the alternative methods of growing plants and the factors that may affect their nutrition levels. Alternative to soil-based cultivation, hydroponics is a popular method that involves growing plants in nutrient-filled water without the use of soil. In this system, plant roots are supported by an inert medium like perlite or coconut coir, and they are exposed to essential nutrients dissolved in water. There are several other methods closely related to hydroponics, such as aeroponics (where plant roots are suspended in air and misted with nutrients) and aquaponics (plants are grown using water from fish tanks, which is rich in organic nutrients). Each of these methods offers unique advantages and some limitations as well, but all allow for plant growth without soil. The nutritional value of plants is determined by various factors, including the type of growing medium (soil or hydroponic), nutrient availability, environmental conditions (light, temperature, and humidity), and the specific plant species being grown.  One of the major advantages of hydroponics and its related methods is the ability to precisely control nutrient levels, environmental conditions, and other aspects of plant growth. This can lead to increased yields and potentially more nutritious plants. Some studies have shown that hydroponically grown plants can possess higher levels of certain nutrients compared to their soil-grown counterparts, although results may vary based on the specific plant species and nutrient being assessed. On the other hand, soil-based cultivation has the natural benefit of a diverse microbial community that supports plant health and nutrient uptake. Moreover, soil contains trace minerals and organic matter that may contribute to the overall nutritional value of plants. However, soil-grown plants are more susceptible to diseases, pests, and fluctuating external conditions, which could impact the quality and nutritional content of the plants. In summary, it's impossible to say whether plants grown in soil are more nutritious than those grown using alternative methods such as hydroponics, aeroponics, or aquaponics. The nutritional value of plants depends on numerous factors, and while some studies have found differences in nutrient content between soil-grown and hydroponic plants, these results are not consistent across all plant species and nutrient types. As a result, it's essential to consider the specific growing conditions and practices being employed, as well as the type of plant being grown, when evaluating the nutritional value of plants grown in different media."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is essential to first understand the meaning of both the given premise and the hypothesis. Entailment is a concept in logic and language where the truth of one statement or proposition necessarily follows from the truth of another. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. Premise: \\"yeah i can't afford to go to them\\" This premise implies that the speaker does not have sufficient financial means or resources to attend a certain event or to participate in a specific activity. The statement indicates a limitation for the speaker due to financial constraints. Hypothesis: \\"I have more than enough to pay for the event.\\" The hypothesis asserts that the speaker has ample financial resources to cover the expenses associated with attending or participating in a particular event or activity. This statement suggests a level of financial comfort or capability that exceeds the requirements of the event in question. Given the understanding of both the premise and hypothesis, it becomes apparent that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Quite the contrary, the two statements represent opposing scenarios. The premise conveys an inability to afford or pay for the event, while the hypothesis suggests an abundance of financial resources for the same event.  In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"I have more than enough to pay for the event\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"yeah i can't afford to go to them\\" as the two statements present contradictory situations. If the premise is true, the hypothesis cannot be true, thereby negating the concept of entailment between these two propositions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Passage: With Upper Burma securely under his control, Nyaungyan's successor Anaukpetlun marched south. His 14,000-strong land and naval forces sacked Prome on 13 July 1608 after a bloody siege of eight months. His 12,000-strong forces then attacked Toungoo, then ruled by his cousin, Natshinnaung, in August 1610. After a siege of 23 days, Natshinnaung agreed to become a vassal on 4 September 1610. But Natshinnaung was deeply unhappy with his reduced status, and secretly invited de Brito of Syriam to attack Toungoo. In July 1612, Syriam and Martaban forces ransacked the city for ten days, and left, taking Natshinnaung to Syriam. In response, Anaukpetlun's army of 13,000  left Ava for Syriam on 26 December 1612. A flotilla of 80 war boats and 30 cargo boats  was also sent down the Irrawaddy to blockade the port. The Burmese forces overcame Portuguese outer defences, and finally blockaded the port on 24 February 1613. But Portuguese gunners and musketeers kept the Burmese at bay for 34 days while waiting for reinforcements from Goa to arrive. On 29 March 1613, however, the Burmese successfully brought down a section of the walls, from their tunnels below. The city was sacked. On 7 April 1613, de Brito his son and Natshinnaung were all executed by impalement. A month later, on 14 May 1613, Binnya Dala of Martaban, submitted. The ruler was nominally tributary to Siam but had ruled the region like a sovereign since the death of Naresuan in 1605.

They would run, jump, and climb trees together, having the best of times. One day, it started to snow, and the whole village became covered in a thick, fluffy blanket of white snow. Reg had never seen snow before and was very excited. He couldn't wait to go outside and play in the snow with his friends. He put on his warmest clothes, his snow boots, and his cozy hat, and he ran outside to join his friends in the snowy wonderland. The children in the village were thrilled with the snow. They built snow forts, had snowball fights, and even made snow angels. They took turns riding on sleds down the small hill near their homes, shouting with glee as they zoomed down the slope. Reg had a blast playing with his friends in the snow, and he quickly learned that snow days were his favorite days, as there was no school and they could play all day long. After hours of play, the children started to feel tired. They returned to their homes, their cheeks flushed from the cold and their hearts filled with joy from the wonderful day they had together. Reg went to bed that night, dreaming of the fantastic snowy adventures he had with his friends. The next day, the snow began to melt, and the village returned to its usual appearance. The children returned to school, and life went back to normal. Despite craving more snow days, Reg had to accept that the snow was gone for now. As the days passed, the memories of their snow day were still fresh in Reg's mind, and he longed to experience it once more. Every night, he would make a wish before bedtime, hoping for another snowy day.  One day, Reg woke up to the sight of giant snowflakes falling from the sky. He couldn't believe his eyes! It was snowing again! Reg quickly got dressed and ran outside to play with his friends. The village was once again filled with laughter and excitement as the children spent their day in the snow. As the sun set, Reg returned home, his heart swelling with happiness from the second snow day he had experienced. The snow continued to fall that night, and Reg knew that there would be no school the next day either.

Choices: i. World. ii. Sports. iii. Business. iv. Science/Tech.","output":"The topic of this passage is about Anglo-US fund firm Amvescap announcing a 50 percent cut to its interim dividend but having plans to return to a progressive dividend policy for 2005 onwards. This information is related to the financial and corporate world, focusing on a specific company's business decisions and plans. Thus, the correct choice is: iii. Business. The passage centers around Amvescap, an Anglo-US investment management company. The announcement of a 50 percent cut to its interim dividend demonstrates the company's adjustments to cope with financial circumstances. An interim dividend refers to a payment made to shareholders of a company before the final financial results are determined. It is usually distributed by the board of directors, acting as a gesture of confidence in the company's future performance. However, the announcement also highlights Amvescap's intention to return to a progressive dividend policy for 2005 onwards. A progressive dividend policy is a strategy where a company regularly increases its dividend payments to shareholders in a steady and predictable manner. This can be an effective way for companies to incentivize and retain investors, as a consistent increase in dividends attracts investors focused on steady income streams and long-term growth potential. In the passage, Amvescap's announcement reflects its financial decisions, market strategy, and efforts to communicate their plans for future growth. These elements directly pertain to the realm of business, as they involve a company's corporate decisions and their effect on investors and financial markets. The passage does not deal with world events or international news (choice i), nor does it talk about any sports-related information (choice ii). Lastly, it doesn't discuss scientific or technological advancements or events (choice iv).

(AP) WASHINGTON — In a rare concession on a highly sensitive issue, Chinese President Hu Jintao used his White House visit on Wednesday to acknowledge \\"a lot still needs to be done\\" to improve human rights in his nation accused of repressing its people. President Barack Obama pushed China to adopt fundamental freedoms but assured Hu the U.S. considers the communist nation a friend and vital economic partner.      Hu's comments met with immediate skepticism from human rights advocates, who dismissed them as words backed by no real history of action. Hu contended his country has \\"made enormous progress\\" but provided no specifics.      Still, his remarks seemed to hearten and surprise U.S. officials, coming during an elaborate visit that centered on boosting trade and trust between the world's two largest economies.      More broadly, Hu and Obama sought to show off a more mature and respectful relationship, not the one often defined by disputes over currency, sovereignty and freedoms. Hu said he wanted even closer contact with Obama; Obama sought again to embrace China's rise, and the two men shared some unexpected laughs.      The Chinese president was treated lavishly, granted the honor of the third state dinner of Obama's presidency. He was welcomed in the morning to the sounds of military bands and the smiles of children on the South Lawn; he was capping the evening at a black-tie White House gala of jazz musicians and all-American food.      Eager to show progress, particularly with the unemployment weighing down his country, Obama said the nations sealed business deals that would mean 45 billion in U.S. exports and create roughly 235,000 jobs. The package included moves by China to expand U.S. investment and curtail theft of intellectual property.      China's human rights record is poor and worsening, with abuses ranging from censorship to illegal detention of dissidents to executions without due process, according to the U.S. government. In a packed news conference - one designed to underscore the freedom of speech on Obama's home turf - Hu was pressed to defend his country's treatment of its people. He initially did not answer, saying he never heard the question translated, although the White House said that it was.      When prodded a second time, Hu defended his country's promotion of human rights. But then he added that China is enduring challenges as it develops and \\"a lot still needs to be done in China in terms of human rights.\\" He said China stood to gain from other countries' input, saying: \\"We're also willing to learn.\\"      Click here for more info, or scroll down for additional updates. ||||| President Obama, hosting Chinese President Hu Jintao on a state visit, said Wednesday that the United States welcomes the \\"peaceful rise\\" of China and urged the one-party state to improve its human rights record.      In a news conference at the White House after talks with Hu and other top Chinese officials, Obama said the two countries have agreed to \\"move ahead with our formal dialogue on human rights. We've agreed to new exchanges to advance the rule of law.\\" He referred to a human rights dialogue that was launched more than a year ago but that so far has produced only one meeting.      Obama also announced that a series of new commercial deals would increase U.S. exports to China by more than 45 billion, supporting about 235,000 American jobs, including many manufacturing jobs. At the same time, he said, China would boost investments in the United States by several billion dollars.      \\"As we look to the future, what's needed, I believe, is a spirit of cooperation that is also friendly competition,\\" Obama said.      Hu said China is willing to have a dialogue on human rights but that it should be based on \\"mutual respect and the principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs.\\" he acknowledged that \\"a lot still needs to be done in China\\" on human rights.      Hu said China \\"is always committed to the protection and promotion of human rights\\" and that the country has made \\"enormous progress\\" that is widely recognized around the world.      The series of meetings with Hu at the White House included one attended by U.S. business leaders. Obama said at that meeting that he wants specific ideas on removing barriers to trade with China and protecting U.S. intellectual property. Hu said China is trying to increase its domestic consumption, a move that would relieve pressure to boost exports as a way to achieve economic growth.      Obama said at the news conference that an expansion of domestic demand in China not only would help U.S. exporters but would contribute to raising China's standard of living.      \\"I absolutely believe that China's peaceful rise is good for the world, and it's good for America,\\" Obama said in response to a Chinese reporter's question. He said later in answer to another question: \\"We welcome China's rise. We just want to make sure that that rise occurs in a way that reinforces international norms, international rules and enhances security and peace, as opposed to it being a source of conflict in the region or around the world.\\"      Earlier, Obama welcomed Hu to the White House with warm words about cooperation and sober reminders of the high stakes of the relationship between the two superpowers and the global importance of universal freedoms.      \\"We have an enormous stake in each other's success,\\" Obama said. \\"Nations, including our own, will be more prosperous and more secure when we work together.\\"      In his remarks, Hu said he hoped to \\"increase mutual trust\\" between China and the United States during his visit and build a \\"comprehensive\\" friendship for the 21st century. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Chinese President Hu Jintao acknowledged the need for improvement in human rights in China during his White House visit, amid President Barack Obama's push for China to adopt fundamental freedoms.

Kevin had to use more sunscreen when at the beach tanning than Justin because","output":"Kevin's fair complexion made him more susceptible to the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays, and therefore, provided him with a higher risk of developing sunburns and, in the long run, potentially increasing his chances of experiencing skin-related issues like photoaging and skin cancer. Additionally, individuals with paler skin tend not to tan as easily, often requiring more cautious and diligent sun care practices. Sunscreen is an essential tool in protecting oneself from these harmful UV rays, and Kevin, being aware of his skin's vulnerability, knew that he needed to apply a more generous amount of sunscreen in comparison to Justin, who seemed to possess a more resilient skin tone. Factors influencing this difference may range from genetic predispositions, ancestry, and exposure to sunlight over time. However, Kevin was not discouraged; he understood that every individual's skin is unique, and that acknowledging and catering to these differences is a crucial aspect of maintaining healthy skin. As the two friends lay side by side under the warm sunrays, Kevin would consistently reapply his broad-spectrum sunscreen every two hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating profusely. This diligent application offered him protection from both UVA and UVB rays, reducing the potential for sunburns and long-term skin damage. In contrast, Justin would apply a lower SPF and reapply less frequently, relying more on his skin's natural melanin to provide a heightened defense against the sun. Over time, Justin developed a deeper, sun-kissed tan, while Kevin maintained his lighter complexion but with a subtle tan. Instead of feeling envious, Kevin took pride in knowing he was taking care of his skin and minimizing the risks associated with excessive UV exposure. This experience served as a reminder to both Kevin and Justin of the importance of proper sun protection—no matter one's skin tone—and the need to adjust sunscreen application habits according to each individual's unique characteristics, ultimately promoting a safer, healthier, and more enjoyable beach tanning experience for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.

I move to repel the rule regarding obligatory school uniform. He moved his hand slightly to the right.","output":"First, let's analyze the meanings in both sentences: 1. In the sentence \\"I move to repel the rule regarding obligatory school uniform,\\" the word \\"move\\" refers to the action of proposing or initiating a change or an action, usually in a formal setting like a meeting or a debate. 2.

In the first sentence, \\"move\\" conveys the idea of proposing or initiating a change, whereas in the second sentence, \\"move\\" refers to a physical action of changing a position.

Translate to English","output":"On this issue, significant and neglected diseases in developing countries have a considerable human rights dimension. This statement highlights the importance of addressing neglected diseases in developing countries from both a public health and human rights perspective. Neglected diseases refer to a group of infectious diseases that primarily affect marginalized populations living in impoverished areas of the world. These diseases are often overlooked and underfunded, leading to a lack of access to prevention, treatment, and care for those who need it most. The human rights dimension of neglected diseases stems from the fact that access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous international human rights treaties. Inadequate attention to these diseases implies that the rights of millions of people – particularly those living in poverty – are not being sufficiently respected, protected, and fulfilled. This situation represents a failure of the global community in terms of prioritizing equitable health development and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. The impact of neglected diseases in developing countries is significant. Some of the most common neglected diseases include lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), leprosy, Chagas disease, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. These diseases can cause severe physical and emotional pain, long-term disabilities, and social stigmatization. In many cases, these illnesses can be fatal if left untreated. Moreover, neglected diseases contribute to a vicious cycle of poverty, as those affected are often unable to work or participate in community life, thereby perpetuating their marginalization and lack of opportunities for advancement. Addressing neglected diseases in developing countries requires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach guided by human rights principles. Such an approach should prioritize the needs and well-being of the affected individuals and communities and promote greater equity in healthcare access, prevention, and treatment. Some of the key elements to effectively address neglected diseases from a human rights perspective include: 1. Increasing awareness and political commitment: National governments, international organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders need to acknowledge and prioritize neglected diseases on their policy agendas. Greater attention should be given to ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to research, prevention, treatment, and care related to these diseases. 2. Strengthening health systems: Investments in healthcare infrastructure and human resources are crucial to ensuring that developing countries can provide necessary care for populations affected by neglected diseases. This includes establishing and maintaining networks of clinics and hospitals, training and retaining healthcare professionals, as well as ensuring the availability of necessary equipment and supplies. 3. Promoting prevention and early detection: Governments should invest in public health campaigns targeting neglected diseases, with a focus on raising awareness about risk factors, prevention measures, and early detection. This could include efforts to improve water and sanitation systems, enhance vector control strategies, and promote vaccination campaigns. 4. Ensuring access to treatment and care: Universal access to effective, affordable, and quality healthcare must be prioritized. Governments and international organizations can play a crucial role in negotiating lower prices for essential medicines and diagnostics related to neglected diseases, as well as providing technical assistance and funding for healthcare providers. 5. Empowering affected communities: Individuals and communities affected by neglected diseases should be involved in decision-making processes related to healthcare policies and programs. Community engagement can help to address stigma, improve compliance with preventive measures and treatment, and foster a sense of ownership in the success of disease control initiatives. By addressing the human rights dimensions of neglected diseases, the global community can work together to ensure that the most vulnerable populations have access to the healthcare they need, reducing the suffering and socioeconomic impacts associated with these devastating illnesses."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Q:Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much.

Imran Khan Niazi PP, HI (Urdu: \`mrn Hmd khn nyzy) (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician, former first-class cricketer and philanthropist who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and serves as a member of the National Assembly. Prior to entering politics, Khan played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century. Khan was born to a Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952 and educated at Aitchison, Worcester, and later at Keble College, Oxford. At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, out of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the rest of 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie.  In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981-1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982-1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984-1985 season.  In India in 1987, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the president of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as \\"the last time I really bowled well\\". He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests. Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself. Entity:","output":"Imran Khan Niazi"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that tells Simon Masrani to kill Indominus rex? from the following article ?  Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is the full name of the person that tells Simon Masrani to kill Indominus rex?\\" is Owen Grady.

Here is a news article: Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images.      Allison Benedikt Allison Benedikt is Slate’s news director. Follow her on Twitter.            President Obama:      Twenty-seven people are dead, 20 of them children, and you just told the nation that we’re all going to have to “extend a hand to those in need.”* “We’ve endured too many of these tragedies,” you rightly noted, clearly moved by the particular horrendousness of what took place in Connecticut today. And then, holding back your tears, you said this: I react to news like this, “not as a president, but as a parent.”      Advertisement            God, that is unbelievably wrong. React as a president.      Get Slate in your inbox.      Earlier today, your press secretary, Jay Carney, speaking for you, said that today is not the day to talk about gun control. “There is, I am sure, will be, rather, a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I do not think today is that day.”      Right, right, today’s not the day because we wouldn’t want to politicize a tragedy. That might make you look crass. And more important than stopping future elementary school students from being shot in the face and head and chest and little legs is for you to show a little tact by rising above your unseemly urge to make this country better. Also, you don’t want to offend anyone directly involved in the shooting. Like the parents of the kids who were murdered this morning while learning basic addition and how to write their ABCs. I’m sure they just want you to stay out of it for the day—keep it to yourself, will ya? Because no one likes a president who would immediately and decisively stand up to stop something like this from happening again. That’s just too political, and you are a statesman.      Plus, the benefit of not “capitalizing” on the tragedy is that, in a few days, most of us will put this whole thing behind us. We have Christmas presents to buy and trees to decorate—this is a very busy time of year! So if you wait this one out, just kind of do the bare minimum of your job, our outrage will probably pass, and you can avoid any of those “usual Washington policy debates.” Those are such a yawn, amirite?      Advertisement            History is on your side. Just this week there was a shooting in a Portland, Ore., mall—did you hear about it? It’s receded in my mind, too. Remember Aurora? Yes, the one with Batman in it! You were running for your second term when that horrific mass shooting happened, so it was definitely not the time to do anything constructive. And then there was another one in Wisconsin—details are hazy in my mind because after a while these rampages all run together. Carney had you covered then, too:      The White House on Monday all but ruled out the possibility that President Barack Obama would make a push for new gun control laws in the aftermath of the shooting rampage in Oak Creek, Wis. Press secretary Jay Carney noted that Obama had called for better enforcement of existing laws in the wake of the massacre at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last month.      \\"I have nothing new to announce,\\" Carney said at his daily briefing.      In fact, you ended up winning the election with barely a mention of gun control and got to trot out Gabrielle Giffords in a moving moment at your Democratic convention, so that worked out. I don’t know what you plan to do after your presidency, but unless you are hoping to replace Wayne LaPierre, you are probably safe to go out on a limb here today. Bill Clinton was a lame-duck president at the time of Columbine, but he pushed for tougher regulations and politicized the hell out of that school shooting. Still, that guy was never known for his political skill, so I see your point.      Anyway, I know you have a very busy schedule and are really looking forward to kicking back for the weekend and hugging your kids a little tighter before bed tonight. TGIF. But could you just let us all know: When would be a better day? ||||| Several Democratic lawmakers, as well as gun control advocates, said that Friday's fatal shootings at a Connecticut elementary school should move the president and Congress to swiftly address the issue of gun violence in America.      Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called on President Obama and Congress to have a \\"serious discussion about gun control\\" in response to the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.            Nadler's statement came as details continued to emerge about the shooting. According to Connecticut State Police have reported that 20 children and 7 adults, including the shooter, have lost their lives. The alleged shooter, Adam Lanza, 24, of Hoboken, New Jersey, killed his father in Hoboken before driving to the Connecticut school, where he killed his mother, a teacher at the school, and the other adults and children, according to multiple media reports.            ADVERTISEMENT      \\"I am absolutely horrified by news of the cold-blooded shooting of dozens of children in Newtown, Conn.,\\" Nadler said in a statement on Friday. \\"Yet another unstable person has gotten access to firearms and committed an unspeakable crime against innocent children. We cannot simply accept this as a routine product of modern American life.\\"If now is not the time to have a serious discussion about gun control and the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our society, I don’t know when is. How many more Columbines and Newtowns must we live through? I am challenging President Obama, the Congress, and the American public to act on our outrage and, finally, do something about this.\\"Another New York Democrat, Rep. Nita Lowey, called the shooting \\"senseless and heartbreaking\\" and said there needed to be \\"concrete action\\" to prevent further gun violence.      \\"We cannot tolerate mass shootings as a mere inconvenience or a normal part of our everyday lives,\\" Lowey said. \\"Easy availability of the deadliest weapons to the most dangerous people has cost countless lives and caused immeasurable suffering, never more so than today. Our expressions of sympathy must be matched with concrete actions to stop gun violence.\\"      \\"It is past time for a national debate on gun control and solutions to ensure that this terrible trend in mass shootings finally comes to an end,\\" said Rep.

I agree, now is not the time to talk about gun laws – the time for that conversation was long before all those kids in Connecticut died today.\\"            Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added his voice to those calling for action to address gun violence.      \\"Today is a day for mourning and prayer, but we must immediately get to work to end these senseless, mass killings of innocent Americans. Together, we must act now to stop the carnage,” Van Hollen said in a release.      At a press conference, President Obama said meaningful action should be taken to prevent future shooting tragedies.      The president said \\"it is time to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,\\" an indication that Obama could be prepared to confront gun control.      Responding to Obama's press conference, Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said his organization was encouraged by Obama's comments.            \\"We were moved by President Obama's raw emotion during his remarks today,\\" Gross said. \\"We are committed to working with him to channel it into the change that is too long overdue.\\"            In 2010 the Brady campaign gave Obama a failing grade on pushing for stricter gun laws.            New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) responded that Obama needs to do more than call for action.            \\"Calling for �?meaningful action’ is not enough. We need immediate action. We have heard all the rhetoric before,\\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \\"What we have not seen is leadership – not from the White House and not from Congress. That must end today. This is a national tragedy and it demands a national response. My deepest sympathies are with the families of all those affected, and my determination to stop this madness is stronger than ever.\\"            Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), who introduced legislation to ban high-capacity magazine clips in automatic weapons, also called for action to improve gun control.            \\"This is a day of great sadness in America, and our hearts go out to the victims and their families,\\" Lautenberg said. \\"This latest shooting tragedy is an unthinkable act of violence carried out against young children and innocent people. Americans are sick and tired of these attacks on our children and neighbors and they are sick and tired of nothing being done in Washington to stop the bloodshed. If we do not take action to address gun violence, shooting tragedies like this will continue. As President Obama said, we must act now 'regardless of the politics.'\\"            — This story was last updated at 4:35 p.m.             ||||| The incoming chairwoman of the House Republican Conference urged caution in passing new gun laws.

Carolyn McCarthy said she has warned the White House “the gloves are off” if President Obama fails to act on the issue.      McCarthy (D-N.Y.), the foremost gun control advocate in Congress, said she spoke with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew before Election Day and told him she will exert pressure on the White House to push for gun control legislation.      “I said, ‘Jack, I know the president is going through an election and I’m telling you after the election I’m coming out full force,’” McCarthy told POLITICO Friday. “I was just giving the White House a heads up that the gloves are off on my side and I was going to do everything I possibly could. … If that meant embarrassing everybody, that’s what I would do.”      Embarrassing the White House, McCarthy said, meant building a large-scale public campaign to ban assault weapons. She pledged to continue to work with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others to build support for her cause.      “I want to talk to the White House. I know that they can’t give me an answer tonight, but I want to know what they’re going to do. I need to know what they’re going to do.”      The Connecticut school shooting sent TV bookers and reporters seeking out McCarthy, a Democrat just elected to her ninth term whose husband was killed and son severely injured in a 1993 mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road. She has long sought to pass gun control legislation, most recently fighting to enact laws forbidding high-capacity gun clips like ones used in past mass shootings.      It’s not yet clear if similar clips were used in the Friday massacre.      McCarthy said she was pleased with Obama’s somber tone in his four-minute White House statement acknowledging Friday’s incident, but said action should have been taken long ago.      “I agree, this is not the time to talk about (gun control),” she said. “It should have been talked about years ago when we started having these mass shootings. It should have been done when Gabby Giffords was shot.”      (This post has been updated.)

In the days that follow, Laura enrolls in a local aerobics class, where Richard watches her intently. When the class dismisses, Richard meets Laura in the parking lot and asks her out to a concert and dinner afterwards; but again, she politely turns him down. Becoming frustrated, Richard then tells Laura that they can't have a relationship if she keeps turning him down. Laura is quick to correct Richard, sternly informing him that their relationship is strictly business. Richard continues to make advances on Laura, convinced that he and Laura are in a romantic relationship. At a KEI softball game, Laura once again denies that their relationship extends beyond the workplace. During the game, Laura's new friend and co-worker Glenda Moritz takes note of Richard's infatuation with her, though Laura says she can handle him. Richard also becomes offended when he notices Laura and Glenda looking his way and laughing, thinking they are making fun of him. Richard continues his hopeless pursuit of Laura. Through an excuse of wanting to present a staff birthday celebration for Laura, he is permitted by a coworker to see her personal dossier, from which he learns of her birthday and address, later showing up at her apartment with a gift. When her roommate tells her she should inform KEI management of the apparent stalking, Laura insists that she can handle Richard, saying that if she did...

Although the word \\"weakness\\" conveys a general sense of being less strong or less capable in both examples, the context in which it is used provides specific, distinct meanings in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"The weakness of the span was overlooked until it collapsed,\\" the word \\"weakness\\" refers to the structural deficiency or lack of stability in a physical object, in this case, the \\"span.\\" A span could be a bridge, an arch, or any other construction element that spans a gap or space. In this context, the weakness refers to an inadequacy in the materials, design, or construction of the span that led to its eventual failure and collapse. This weakness could be due to faulty engineering, poor materials, or damage sustained over time. In the second sentence, \\"His weakness increased as he became older,\\" the word \\"weakness\\" refers to a loss or reduction in one's physical strength, endurance, or overall health. This type of weakness typically affects people as they age, due to factors such as the natural aging process, muscle atrophy, or a decline in overall health and fitness. Here, the weakness is of a personal and biological nature, as opposed to the structural and engineering-oriented weakness mentioned in the first sentence. Even though both sentences use the word \\"weakness\\" to convey a sense of vulnerability or failing, the respective contexts within each sentence give the word distinct meanings related to the specific subject in question. In the first case, it is the structural aspect of a physical object, while in the second case, it is the personal, physical aspect of an individual's health and well-being that is being referred to."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Contact is made with a virus - The virus enters the human or animal body - The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food - The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses - The virus replicates and spreads - The virus causes symptoms in the body as the immune system tries to expel the virus.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more contact is made with a virus happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process. Direct Effect: Hypothetically, if more contact is made with the virus, theoretically, more viral particles can enter and potentially infect the host organism, thus leading to more cells being targeted and possibly damaged, which is contrary to the desired effect of having less cell damage. Indirect Effect: However, it is also crucial to consider the immune system's role in this process. If more contacts are made with the virus, the immune system's response may also increase, potentially minimizing the number of cells that the viruses can infect and damage. This effect, though, is highly dependent on the individual's immune system strength and resilience. Lastly, regular exposure also increases the chances of developing immunity, either through the development of antibodies from a previous encounter or through vaccination. This immunity can help reduce cell damage due to future encounters with the virus, thus achieving the stated goal indirectly. However, this should not be used as a strategy to expose oneself deliberately to a virus, especially lethal ones, as this could result in severe illness or death. In summary, while more contact with the virus might typically suggest more potential cell damage, the complexity of the immune response and the development of immunity can play significant roles, potentially leading to less cell damage in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. When the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the \\"creep\\" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who's in town to present his new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this isn't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\"-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film \\"Anatomie\\".

Cardboard and other absorbent scrap material can be used as a makeshift tarp. If your doors have any marks or dents, now is the time to take care of them.

[II] book was so cryptic.","output":"The answer could be found in the scroll, but not in the book, as the writing in the scroll was so cryptic. The ancient scroll, carefully preserved and handed down through generations, contained mysterious symbols and coded messages that had been written by a secretive order of scholars and mystics. While the book, a more accessible and straightforward text, also touched upon related topics, it did not possess the depth or concealed knowledge embedded within the scroll's enigmatic language. The cryptic nature of the scroll's writing was, in part, a deliberate choice by its authors. They sought to both protect and preserve their treasured knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. The cryptic script and obscure symbols served as a kind of lock, allowing only those who possessed the key to unlock its hidden wisdom. In contrast, the book was written in a more conventional language, making it accessible to a wider audience. However, this accessibility came at the expense of the depth and richness of the secret teachings contained within the scroll. While the book could provide the reader with a general understanding of the subject, it lacked the transformative insights and esoteric knowledge that the scroll contained. To truly understand the scroll's meaning, one needed not only the key to decipher its symbols but also the eyes to see beyond the veil that obscured its hidden teachings. This required an in-depth knowledge of symbolism, a keen intuition, and a willingness to look beyond the surface to the deeper, hidden layers of meaning. Over time, as the scroll was carefully studied and interpreted by those who had the skills and abilities to unlock its secrets, the teachings it contained were gradually integrated into various schools of thought and practice. This, in turn, led to the growth and development of new knowledge and wisdom, which might then be incorporated into more accessible forms, such as the book, ensuring that at least part of the scroll's content could reach a wider audience. Nevertheless, the scroll remained elusive and enigmatic, its cryptic language continuing to challenge and inspire seekers of wisdom for generations to come. Ultimately, the choice of the scroll as the repository of this hidden knowledge served to protect those sacred teachings, ensuring that only the most dedicated and diligent students would be able to access the transformative power and insights it contained.

Write an article with the title: \\"Edward Albee Travels to Easter Island\\"","output":"Title: Edward Albee Travels to Easter Island Introduction The renowned American playwright, Edward Albee, known for his profound examinations of human relationships in plays like \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" and \\"A Delicate Balance,\\" took a journey to one of the most remote yet fascinating destinations on our planet. Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, is a small Polynesian island located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, famous for its gigantic stone statues, called moai. The island has long held mysteries for historians, archaeologists, and tourists alike, which is why it comes as no surprise that a creative genius like Albee would be drawn to its enigmatic appeal. In this article, we will delve into Albee's journey to Easter Island, exploring its sights and sounds through his creative lens and perspectives. A Journey of Inspiration Edward Albee, having conquered the world of theater, sought out new landscapes to inspire his literary creations. Upon learning about Easter Island's history and enigma, he realized that it was an ideal destination for fueling his imaginative pursuits. Thus, Albee set off on a journey to the remote island, ready to absorb its palpable energy. Exploring the Moai Statues Upon arriving on Easter Island, Albee was immediately captivated by the vast, open landscape, marked by the towering moai statues. These monuments were created by the Rapa Nui people between 1250 and 1500, and they continue to mystify researchers today, who debate the meaning behind them and the methods of their construction and transportation. Albee, being an artist himself, was not merely content with observing from afar. He ventured closer, attempting to decipher the faces carved into the stone, contemplating the emotions they conveyed. The moai acted as muses for Albee, provoking existential questions that would later make their way into his work, blending the small island's rich history with the playwright's masterful storytelling skills. The Rapa Nui Culture and Heritage Though best known for the enigmatic moai, Easter Island also boasts a wealth of cultural heritage, and Albee was determined to take it all in. He attended local festivals with traditional music and dance performances, marveling at how the Rapa Nui people preserved their ancient customs despite centuries of colonization and external influence. Edward Albee also immersed himself in the island's history, visiting the renowned Rano Raraku quarry, where the stone for the moai statues was sourced, and the Orongo ceremonial village. It is at the latter where the unique Birdman cult rituals were performed until the latter half of the 19th century. The Lessons from Easter Island As a world-class playwright, Albee approached his journey to Easter Island not simply as a sightseeing tour but as an opportunity to learn and grow as an artist. He came to realize that Rapa Nui's history was punctuated by episodes of environmental and societal collapse. Overpopulation paired with the depletion of limited resources led to conflict and the decline of once-thriving communities. This story resonated with Albee, who saw in it a cautionary tale for modern society – a theme that would make its way into his later work. Conclusion Edward Albee's travels to Easter Island provided the playwright with a wealth of inspiration, derived from the island's captivating landscape, majestic moai statues, and the resilience of Rapa Nui culture. The lessons he gleaned during his time on the island – themes of societal and environmental collapse, and the importance of preserving cultural heritage – were woven into his subsequent theatrical masterpieces. Easter Island's enigma proved to be the perfect catalyst for Edward Albee's creative genius, resulting in his continued impact on the world of theater and the human experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Dorothea Dix left home at an early age--of her own free will--to live with her grandmother. At fourteen, Dorothea was teaching school at Worcester, Massachusetts. A short time after she had begun teaching, she set up a school for young girls in her grandparents' home. Stress was placed on moral character at Dorothea's school, which she conducted until she was thirty-three. She was forced to give up teaching at her grandparents' home, however, when she became ill a few years of inactivity followed. In 1841 Dorothea began to teach again, accepting a Sunday school class in the East Cambridge, Massachusetts prison. Here she first came upon insane people   locked up together with prisoners. In those days insane people were treated even worse than prisoners. There were only a few madhouses in the entire country. Therefore prisons, poor houses, and houses of correction were used to keep the insane. Dorothea Dix made a careful investigation of the inhuman treatment of the insane. It was considered unfeminine   for a woman to devote herself to such work at this time. But this did not stop Dorothea Dix from providing proper medical care for the insane. Gradually, because of her investigations, conditions were improved. More than thirty mental institutions were founded or rebuilt in the United States because of her hard work.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People diet to look more attractive.Fish diet to avoid being beaten up,thrown out of their social group,and getting eaten as a result.That is the fascinating conclusion of the latest research into fish behavior by a team of Australian scientists. The research team have discovered that subordinate  fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.\\"In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,\\" explains Marian Wong.\\"All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.\\" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable. The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.\\"As yet,we...

I feel obligated to warn you that some of the sensations, some of the physical reactions which the actors on the screen will feel will also be experienced for the first time in motion picture history by certain members of this audience...And remember this: A scream at the right time may save your life.\\" The screen goes dark and a man's screams are heard. His head (an uncredited Pat Colby) floats towards the audience. Two women's heads (left is an uncredited Gail Bonney, right is an uncredited Amy Fields), screaming, join the man. We fade in on a convict being led to the execution chamber. He is Ryerson (an uncredited Bob Gunderson) and two guards drag him to his fate--the electric chair. Standing in the hall is his brother-in-law, Ollie Higgins (Phillip Coolidge). Title and credits are shown over the march to the chamber. In a nearby lab, Dr. Warren Chapin (Vincent Price) prepares for the state required autopsy of the convicted and executed man. The body is wheeled from the execution chamber to the lab on a gurney. Chapin does his work and Ollie comes in to watch. They chat about the electrocution and Chapin notes, \\"This man's vertebrae are cracked. They're nearly splintered in two.\\" He explains he's seen this before, always related to fear and this is the focus of his research. Ollie postulates it might be what causes your spine to tingle.

William Castle's psychological horror film revolves around Dr. Warren Chapin's (Vincent Price) research into the Tingler's existence and his attempts to prove its deadly effects. Martha (Judith Evelyn), a deaf and mute woman who is also Ollie Higgins' (Phillip Coolidge) wife, becomes the Tingler's next victim. She is unable to scream, which prevents her from releasing the fear-induced tension within her body. This creates a perfect environment for the Tingler to thrive, as it continues to inflict pain and torment on her. As the movie unfolds, Martha experiences increasing levels of fear and anxiety due to a series of strange and frightening occurrences in her apartment. The Tingler ultimately capitalizes on this amplified fear, causing her immense pain. Eventually, the Tingler drives Martha to the point of death as she is unable to scream and release the tension that the Tingler feeds on. After Martha's death, Dr. Chapin manages to extract the Tingler from her spine, proving its existence and the significance of his research. He then further emphasizes the importance of screaming as a natural response to fear, not only as a way to alleviate tension but also as an act that can potentially save a person's life from the deadly grasp of the Tingler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

The desire for a permanent connection across the Limfjord at Aggersund dates back to the early 1900s. In the mid-1920s, citizens in Løgstør reduced a selection, which appeared with a number of suggestions for a bridge. However, the initiative stranded controversy about the alignment and funding. In 1936, the idea was resumed by the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transport as a possible employment measure, and in 1939 the construction of the bridge, which was funded by Aalborg, Hjørring and Thisted Amter, began. The bridge was projected by Christen Ostenfeld. The initiation took place on 18 June 1942. The bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK. During the German occupation of Denmark, the bridge was strategically important for the German shipments of crew and equipment to and from Norway. Therefore, a military support point was built in 1943-44, consisting of 11 concrete plants on the north side and 6 on the south side. In addition, minefields and other types of barriers were introduced. Two large Flak bunkers on the south side and one on the north side are still available and are available. The other smaller bunkers have either been removed or located in a private area without public access. In 2000, the Aggersund Bridge beams were strengthened, increasing the carrying capacity of the bridge.

Early 1900s - Since we don't have a specific year, we can assume it to be around 1900, when the desire for the bridge was first proposed. 2. 1939 - The year when the bridge construction was funded and had begun.

As the man starts to play his saxophone, his music has a unique magnetic quality that draws an increasingly larger crowd. People from all walks of life, ages, and cultural backgrounds gather around him, mesmerized by the melodies and the expression of his music. The diverse crowd is reminiscent of the marching band's earlier performance, highlighting the transcendent nature of music as well as its ability to create connections between people. In each city, the man's saxophone melodies seem to evoke different emotions and responses. In one city, his music brings joy and laughter; in another, it stirs feelings of nostalgia and melancholy. Some listeners are moved to dance with wild abandon, while others slow dance with their loved ones, united in the rhythm of the saxophone. As the man continues to play his saxophone in various cities, word spreads across social media platforms, and his performances go viral. This newfound fame and recognition allow him to collaborate with major musicians and creators, further proving the power his music has to inspire and bring people together. This cross-city collaboration eventually leads to a massive concert featuring the saxophonist, the marching band from earlier performances, and other musicians from different backgrounds.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Legion (David Charles Haller) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. Charles Xavier met Gabrielle Haller while he was working in an Israeli psychiatric facility where she was one of his patients. Xavier was secretly using his psychic powers to ease the pain of Holocaust survivors institutionalized there. The two had an affair that resulted in the birth of their son David. Xavier was initially unaware of this, as Gabrielle never told him she was pregnant.  When he was very young, David was among the victims of a terrorist attack, in which he was the only survivor. The trauma of the situation caused David to manifest his mutant powers, incinerating the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he absorbed the mind of the terrorist leader, Jemail Karami, into his own. Being linked to so many others at their time of death, he was rendered catatonic, and remained in the care of Moira MacTaggert at the Muir Island mutant research facility. The trauma caused David's personality to splinter, with each of the personalities controlling a different aspect of his psionic power.  Karami struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David's. Using David's telepathic abilities, he reintegrated the multiple personalities into David's core personality. Some of the personalities resisted Karami, and two proved to be formidable opponents: Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer, who commands David's telekinetic power, and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who controls David's pyrokinetic power. Wayne intended to destroy Karami's consciousness to preserve his own independent existence within David's mind. Neither personality succeeds, and Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continue as David's dominant personalities.  During his time at Muir Island, David emerged from his catatonia. Soon after, David was possessed by the Shadow King, who used his powers to psychically increase the amount of hatred in the world and feed on the malignant energy. During this time, the Shadow King, as David, killed the mutant Destiny. The X-Men and X-Factor fought the Shadow King, and as a result, David was left in a coma. Who had the affair?","output":"Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller had an affair. They met while Charles was working at an Israeli psychiatric facility and Gabrielle was one of his patients.

What is the answer for the question: Whose nickname was Mi? from the following article ?  In the autumn of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau's 1918 Le coq et l'arlequin in favour of a \\"living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness\\".

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

(CNN) -- Three attacks were made on Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities in Nigeria on Sunday, according to a company spokesman who said details were not immediately available. Investigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says. The attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried. \\"Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities,\\" he said. The attacks happened in remote areas, making investigations difficult, he said, adding that the company would not send in investigators until it was certain the area was secure. It was not known whether there were any casualties, he said.

We want to find the value of \\"g.\\" First, let's try to get all the g's (ball) on one side.

Let's subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 6*g + 30 - 30 = 0 - 30 This simplifies to: 6*g = -30 We are so close! Now we just need to find out the value of g. To do this, we will divide both sides by 6: 6*g / 6 = -30 / 6 This simplifies to: g = -5 So, g (the number of balls on the other side) is -5.

The paragraph provides information about various environments where sediments are deposited. It clearly states that beaches and deserts collect large deposits of sand. This sand accumulation is due to the natural processes, such as wind and water movement, which transport and deposit these sediments in these environments.

ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, which, in turn, had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company, but then sold off). ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Which would be lighter, item A or item B? A:","output":"To determine which is lighter between item A (Earth) and item B (sample of surface rock), we can compare their specific gravity values. Specific gravity is essentially a ratio of the density of a material to the density of a reference substance (usually water).  From the information provided:  - Earth's mean specific gravity: 5.515 (item A) - Typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface: 2.7–3.3 (item B) Since the specific gravity of item A (Earth) is higher than the specific gravity of item B (surface rock), this indicates that the Earth's material is denser than the surface rock. However, it is important to note that we are comparing the densities, not the actual weights of these items. To compare the weights, we can use the formula for weight: weight = mass × gravity. Since we don't have the mass values for both item A and item B, we cannot directly compare their weights. However, we can infer that if we were to take equally sized samples of both item A and item B, item A (Earth's material) would be heavier due to its higher specific gravity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process:  - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More Chicken snakes nest near you happens, how will it affect LESS birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having more chicken snakes nesting near the area will indeed have effects, both direct and indirect, on the process involving birds, their eggs, and their lifecycle.  Chicken snakes, also known as rat snakes, are known for their predatory behavior towards small birds and their eggs. They are quite successful climbers and can easily reach nests that are located high up in the trees. Therefore, the increase in the population of chicken snakes in an area can affect the process of bird reproduction significantly. 1. Direct Effects: The immediate and most obvious effect of an increase in the population of chicken snakes around bird nests is the increased predation of bird eggs and fledgling birds. Chicken snakes are adept at climbing and hunting, thus they can easily access the bird nests. They feed on the eggs, reducing the number of eggs that can potentially hatch into baby birds, causing a significant decrease in the bird population. 2. Indirect Effects: Apart from the direct predation, there are several indirect effects as well. An increase in the population of chicken snakes can cause stress among bird populations. Birds might perceive the area as unsafe for nesting and breeding, hence they might start looking for other areas for nesting, leading to a decrease in the bird population in the affected area.  3. Disruption of life cycle: The increased presence of chicken snakes also disrupts the normal lifecycle of birds. With their eggs under threat, fewer birds reach adulthood, which directly affects their chances of finding a mate. This disrupts another phase in their life cycle: the laying of eggs and the creation of new generations.  4. Alteration of Habitat: If birds start leaving the affected area in search of safer nesting sites, this also results in an alteration of the local habitat. Other species dependent on these birds for their survival could be impacted negatively too, leading to an imbalanced ecosystem. 5. Evoked Defensive Mechanisms: Birds might start developing new defensive mechanisms or strategies in response to the increased snake threat, which could possibly alter their existing lifestyle and behavior. They might build their nests in new unfamiliar areas, leading to more stress and possibly lower survival rates.  In conclusion, the increase in the population of chicken snakes near a bird's habitat would decrease the number of birds, as it threatens their survival at various stages, right from the egg to adult stage, thereby disrupting the described process - 'A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963, four and a half years after his election and two months after the completion of his final and famed encyclical, Pacem in terris. He was buried in the Vatican grottoes beneath Saint Peter's Basilica on 6 June 1963 and his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by his successor, Pope Paul VI, who declared him a Servant of God. In addition to being named Venerable on 20 December 1999, he was beatified on 3 September 2000 by Pope John Paul II alongside Pope Pius IX and three others. Following his beatification, his body was moved on 3 June 2001 from its original place to the altar of Saint Jerome where it could be seen by the faithful. On 5 July 2013, Pope Francis – bypassing the traditionally required second miracle – declared John XXIII a saint, after unanimous agreement by a consistory, or meeting, of the College of Cardinals, based on the fact that he was considered to have lived a virtuous, model lifestyle, and because of the good for the Church which had come from his having opened the Second Vatican Council.

Choose your story that continues the following story. A lawsuit was filed against Patricia by Erin because  Select from the following. [-] Patricia had damaged their new car. [-] Erin had damaged their new car.","output":"Patricia had damaged their new car. Erin, an ambitious software engineer, had just bought her dream car after years of hard work and dedication. As soon as she laid her eyes on this top-of-the-line Sedan with its sleek black finish and state-of-the-art technology, she knew it was the one. Carefully and meticulously, she had saved penny after penny, only allowing herself this one significant splurge. The day Erin brought her sparkling new car home, her neighbors and friends were in awe as they admired her accomplishment. Patricia, Erin's neighbor and close friend for over a decade, was one of those friends. As a gesture of goodwill, Erin had decided to let Patricia test drive her new car around the block. Little did Erin know that this would turn into one of her biggest regrets. Patricia eagerly hopped into the driver's seat, excited to try out Erin's new car. Though Patricia wasn't a reckless driver, she became easily distracted when inside the vehicle. As she was maneuvering through the neighborhood, showing off her knowledge of the high-tech gadgets, she suddenly heard an alarming \\"CRUNCH\\" sound. Whirling her head, Patricia saw that she had carelessly sideswiped a parked car owned by neighborhood resident Mike, who had caught the entire incident on his security camera. Patricia's heart raced, and her face flushed red with embarrassment. Once back at Erin's house, the two women stepped out of the car, both utterly dismayed by the significant damages. Mike, having seen the event unfold on his camera, approached Erin and Patricia, demanding compensation for his ruined car. Because Erin's car was uninsured, the incident had severe implications on her finances. Patricia, overwhelmed with guilt, apologized profusely to both Erin and Mike, promising to cover the damages but never followed through. Months went by, and Patricia continued to offer platitudes with no actions to back them. The friendship between Patricia and Erin strained over the incident, and Erin found herself struggling with crippling debt that she had not prepared for. Finally, she decided that the only solution was to take legal action against Patricia. Erin filed a lawsuit against Patricia in civil court, seeking restitution for the damages to both her and Mike's vehicle. The aftermath of the car accident had not only left Erin with a damaged car but had severely damaged her trust and friendship with Patricia as well. Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the once-close friends faced off and bore their grievances. Thoroughly reviewing all the evidence, including multiple witness statements and video documentation from Mike's security camera, the judge declared Patricia guilty of willful negligence. The verdict stated that Patricia was required to cover all costs related to the damages caused to both Erin and Mike's cars, including any additional legal fees. Despite winning the case, Erin found herself heartbroken over the loss of her treasured friendship. It seemed that their years of care and laughter had crumbled under the weight of Patricia's negligence and failure to take responsibility for her actions. It was a pyrrhic victory, and the once jubilant friends went their separate ways, lamenting the events that led them to this point. A single incident, one lapse of judgment, led to a series of life-altering consequences for both Patricia and Erin. Not only did it mar their strong friendship, but the incident also saw the destruction of financial security for the protagonists. A testament to the fact that sometimes, a momentary lack of focus can result in a lifetime of regret and consequences."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: In America, after middle school comes high school, which includes grades 9 through 12.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load?  After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","output":"Andres Serrano used three bodily fluids for the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For the Load album cover, Serrano created the artwork titled \\"Blood and Semen III\\" by pressing a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. This visual piece marked a significant change in the band's musical direction and image. For the Reload album cover, Serrano employed a different combination of fluids. In this case, he used a mixture of blood and urine to create the artwork. The Reload album was a follow-up to Load, containing songs that were not included in the previous release. Both album covers showcased Serrano's unique artistic style and played a role in redefining Metallica's image during that period. In summary, the three bodily fluids Andres Serrano used for the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums were blood, semen, and urine, creating distinctive and memorable visuals associated with these records."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paramount and CBS Studios went to court in 2016 to enforce rights over what fictional language when the fan-funded Axanar company sought to produce a prequel to a popular 1966-founded franchise set originally in the 23rd century????","output":"In 2016, Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios went to court to enforce their rights over the Klingon language, a fictional language created within the Star Trek universe. The legal dispute arose when the fan-funded production company, Axanar Productions, sought to produce a prequel to the popular Star Trek franchise, which was originally created in 1966 and set in the 23rd century. The prequel was titled \\"Axanar\\" and aimed to tell the story of Garth of Izar, a legendary Federation captain who played an essential role in the defeat of the Klingon Empire during the Four Years War. The issue at hand was the fact that Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios held a copyright over the intellectual property in the Star Trek universe, including but not limited to characters, locations, technology, and even the Klingon language. The Klingon language was developed in the early 1980s by linguist Marc Okrand for use in Star Trek films and TV series. Since its introduction, the Klingon language has gained a considerable fan following, with enthusiasts learning and even creating new words based on its complex and intricate grammar rules. However, Paramount and CBS Studios maintained that they held exclusive rights to the use of the language in commercial productions. In their lawsuit, Paramount and CBS Studios claimed that Axanar Productions was infringing upon their copyright by using the Klingon language, among other elements from the Star Trek universe, without obtaining the necessary license or permission. The studios argued that the unauthorized use of their copyrighted material in a fan-funded production had the potential to cause damage and dilution of their intellectual property value. In response, Axanar Productions argued that the Klingon language, as a \\"useful system,\\" was not protected under copyright law. They maintained that the principles of language, culture, and speech should not be subject to the control and ownership of a private corporation. This counterargument sparked a debate over the extent to which fictional languages can be copyrighted. The case was ultimately settled out of court in January 2017. As a part of the settlement agreement, Axanar Productions agreed to make substantial changes to the script and follow the newly created guidelines by CBS and Paramount for fan films. These guidelines included restrictions, such as limiting the use of copyrighted material and reducing the length of fan films to ensure that they remain true to their non-commercial nature. The Axanar lawsuit not only underscored the importance of adhering to licensing agreements and intellectual property rights but also led to a broader discussion on the copyright status of constructed languages and their place within popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  1990  for the following movie plot:  On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Rob was evaluating two research studies on climate change, study A and study B. Study A explained how increased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. On the other hand, study B showed how decreased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. Rob found the studies very interesting.  Would study B see less or more wildlife population than study A?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. A:","output":"Considering the information provided in the hint and the two research studies, it is evident that the main cause of global warming and climate change is the increased anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. The increased greenhouse gases result in the trapping of heat inside Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the rapid warming of the planet. This warming has far-reaching detrimental effects on natural habitats, leading to the extinction of certain ecosystems, and ultimately causing a reduction in wildlife populations. With this understanding, we can evaluate how the two research studies, A and B, would potentially impact wildlife populations: Study A examines the effects of increased greenhouse gases on the climate. Since it is established that heightened levels of greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, which in turn causes a reduction in wildlife population due to habitat destruction, it can be concluded that study A would likely observe a decrease in wildlife population as greenhouse gases continue to increase. Conversely, study B investigates the effects of decreased greenhouse gases on the climate. Lowering the levels of greenhouse gases would help in mitigating the negative impacts of global warming and climate change, which include habitat destruction and subsequent population decreases in wildlife. Therefore, study B would likely observe an increase or stabilization in wildlife populations as a result of decreasing greenhouse gases. In conclusion, when comparing the two studies, study B would see more wildlife population than study A due to the lessening of greenhouse gases and the resulting mitigation of adverse effects associated with global warming and climate change. This highlights the importance of addressing the human-induced release of greenhouse gases and implementing policies and strategies to reduce these emissions in order to protect ecosystems and preserve biodiversity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Article: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Netflix Cancels Contest Over Privacy Concerns Netflix’s 1 million contest for the best method to improve its movie recommendations was such a research and business hit that, when the winners were declared last September, the company immediately announced plans for another one. But it turned out that letting very smart computer scientists and statisticians dig through the video rental site’s data had one major, unforeseen drawback. A pair of researchers at the University of Texas showed that the supposedly anonymized data released for the contest, which included movie recommendations and choices made by hundreds of thousands of customers, could in fact be used to identify them. That brought the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, and also drew a lawsuit from KamberLaw L.L.C. On Friday, bowing to privacy concerns, Netflix said it was shelving its plans for a sequel to the first contest. In a post on a company blog, Neil Hunt, Netflix’s chief product officer, explained that the company had “reached an understanding” with the F.T.C. and settled the lawsuit. “The resolution of both matters involves certain parameters on how we use Netflix data in any future research programs,” he said. Netflix, Mr. Hunt wrote, will continue to “explore ways to collaborate with the research community” to improve its recommendation system. The three-year competition for the first Netflix Prize, which began in 2006, offered 1 million to the first group that could improve the predictive accuracy of the company’s movie recommendation software by at least 10 percent. A seven-person team, led by two current and one former employee of AT&T Labs, won the contest. Summary:","output":"Netflix had to cancel its 1 million contest aimed at finding the best method to improve its movie recommendations system due to privacy concerns. The contest involved allowing computer scientists and statisticians to dig through Netflix's video rental data, which was supposed to be anonymized. However, researchers from the University of Texas discovered that the data could be used to identify individual customers. This led to scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and a lawsuit from KamberLaw LLC. Netflix then decided to shelve its plans for a follow-up contest. Despite canceling the contest, the company still intends to collaborate with the research community to enhance its recommendation system. The original contest, which began in 2006, was won by a team led by current and former employees of AT&T Labs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Parts of Chile were evacuated today after the nation was struck by a strong earthquake. Amid fears a tsunami could follow the tremor, thousands in the South American country were warned to leave their homes and seek higher ground. The earthquake struck 37 miles from the port city of Iquique, at a depth of 12.4 miles below ground. It was initially measured at 7.0 on the Richter scale, which was later revised to 6.7. Worse in Chile: 100,000 people were ordered to higher ground in the wake of the first Chile tremor on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, in Chile: This map, released by the U.S. Geological Survey, shows the point off the Chilean coast where their 6.7 mag earthquake happened Sunday evening. It caused the Chilean Navy to issue an evacuation order in case of a tsunami, though the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they were not expecting one. The ONEMI emergency office said that preliminarily no damage or injuries had been reported. Nobody seems to have been injured by the quake. Chile's massive copper mines mines, clustered in the mineral-rich North, appeared unscathed. Collahuasi, a partnership between Glencore Xstrata and Anglo American, located in the area, said operations were normal. People could be seen today gathered on high ground outside the northern towns of Arica and Tocopilla, which the Navy had warned were at risk.

Movie plot title: The Haunting in Connecticut Movie plot: In 1987, Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen) is driving her son Matthew (Kyle Gallner) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a âFor Rentâ sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a sÃ©ance, emitting ectoplasm. Wendy and Matt find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Ramsey Aickman. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host sÃ©ances with Jonah as the medium. At one sÃ©ance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared. Nicholas theorizes that Aickman was practicing necromancy in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. That night, Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them. Matt awakens to find Aickmanâs symbols carved into his flesh. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters...

Step 1: Determine the best time for the sailing lessons Christopher first needed to find a suitable time for both himself and Eric to begin the sailing lessons. He knew that Eric was quite busy, so he thought it would be best to find a weekend where they both had free time. Step 2: Gather appropriate equipment and resources Before the lessons could begin, Christopher needed to make sure he had the right equipment to begin sailing. He made a list of essential items such as a life jacket, non-slip shoes, gloves, and sunglasses. He also decided to look into renting a beginner-friendly sailboat, as he did not own one himself. Step 3: Learn and understand sailing terminology Christopher thought it would be helpful to familiarize himself with some basic sailing terminology before starting his lessons with Eric. He looked up terms such as \\"port,\\" \\"starboard,\\" \\"bow,\\" and \\"stern\\" so that he would have a foundational understanding of what Eric would be teaching him. Step 4: Schedule and prepare for the first lesson Once Christopher and Eric had found a date that worked for them both, Christopher started preparing for his first sailing lesson. He gathered his equipment, double-checked the weather forecast to ensure conditions were safe for sailing, and made sure to arrive at the marina early. Step 5: Begin sailing lessons with Eric Christopher met Eric at the marina and they boarded the rented sailboat. Eric began teaching Christopher all about boat handling, safety procedures, and essential maneuvers. Christopher paid close attention and diligently practiced each new skill under Eric's guidance. Step 6: Gain hands-on experience and practice As Christopher became more comfortable with the basics of sailing, he started to gain more hands-on experience by taking the helm and practicing maneuvers under Eric's supervision. Eric provided constructive feedback, ensuring that Christopher continually improved his sailing skills. Step 7: Continue learning and growing as a sailor Over time, Christopher's confidence and knowledge grew, and he became increasingly proficient at sailing. He was grateful for Eric's expert guidance and continued to practice regularly, inspired by the thrill and sense of freedom that sailing provided. As Christopher's passion for sailing blossomed, he began dreaming of one day sailing his own boat.

Write a summary based on this article: With 96 Americans killed with guns on the average day, and murderers targeting our schools, churches and concerts, the American people are getting fed up with inaction on the part of our politicians. Although the majority of Americans favor stronger gun control measures, they never seem to happen. This is in large part due to the actions of a single organization, the National Rifle Association.      Historically, the NRA supported hunting, marksmanship, safety training – and common sense gun laws. But a faction takeover of its leadership in 1977 brought into power a group with extreme views, which have now become the NRA party line.      Many members of the NRA don’t support its more extreme policies. For example, 74% of NRA members support requiring background checks for anyone purchasing a gun, and 71% support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns – positions that are the opposite of the NRA stance. So why do they remain members? One reason is financial – NRA members receive valuable discounts on things like insurance and hotel stays.      The myriad of discounts offered to NRA members by corporations are listed on the membership benefits page on the NRA site. These partners of the NRA include MetLife, LifeLock, eHealth, Norton Security, Allied Movers, NorthAmerican Van Lines, Hertz, Avis, and the First National Bank of Omaha. Indeed, the NRA touts the many special discounts as number two in its list of reasons to join the organization, and stresses the “access to hundreds of dollars in savings.”      These corporate partnerships not only help the NRA attract and retain members, but also provide funds for the NRA that help fuel its extremist agenda.      It’s time to tell companies that it is no longer acceptable for them to be associated with the NRA. Let’s send a message to the NRA membership benefits partners they must end sever their relationships with the NRA.      This petition is aimed at 25 of the companies involved in the NRA membership benefits program. This is because 25 is the limit for a Change.org petition. Let’s start with these 25, and then go after the others later.      In addition to signing and sharing this petition, please look at our Google document which lists all of the partner companies and contact information for them, and consider also reaching out to the companies directly to show your displeasure. ||||| In this Feb. 22, 2018, photo, Dana Loesch, spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at National Harbor, Md.

(Associated Press) In this Feb. 22, 2018, photo, Dana Loesch, spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at National Harbor, Md. She is poised, photogenic... (Associated Press)      CHICAGO (AP) — Dana Loesch is the new public face of the National Rifle Association, an organization long associated with older white men.      At 39, she's poised, photogenic and a skilled public speaker, yet she's not softening the message of the NRA as it becomes an increasingly active voice in the nation's culture wars, with positions on everything from immigration to the media.      In the aftermath of the shooting deaths of 17 people, mostly students, at a Florida high school, it's Loesch who has been the NRA's main messenger.      The NRA dispatched Loesch last week to a CNN town hall, where she was questioned by students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the Valentine's Day shooting. Often brash and combative, Loesch was measured and even-tempered, though she was booed when she left the stage.      Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative radio host who has been critical of the NRA, said Loesch's skill is communicating with a broad range of Americans while retaining the ultra-conservative base built by Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president and CEO since 1991.      \\"Imagine Wayne LaPierre sitting in that seat and you realize the significance of Dana,\\" Sykes said. \\"She can bring the hot sauce without having that persona\\" of an angry white man.      Even before taking over as NRA spokeswoman last year, Loesch had a robust conservative following, cultivated on social media — she has more than 46 million Twitter followers — and through years of television and radio appearances, including on her own radio program, \\"The Dana Show.\\"      The day after the televised town hall, she was back in her more familiar mode, speaking to a far friendlier audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington. Loesch defiantly defended NRA's 5 million members, who she said \\"will not be gaslighted into thinking that we're responsible for a tragedy that we had nothing to do with.\\"      And, her voice dripping with condescension, she addressed journalists from the mainstream media, who she said \\"love mass shootings\\" because \\"crying white mothers are ratings gold.\\"      Her criticism of the media recalled an NRA video last summer in which she attacked The New York Times in a way that some on the right and the left feared could incite violence. In the video, Loesch said NRA members have \\"had it\\" with the newspaper's \\"fake news\\" and warned: \\"Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow. ... In short? We're coming for you.\\"      Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she was not in the least reassured by Loesch's appearance at the town hall, especially after she attacked the media the following day.      \\"She's younger. She's a woman and a mom. She's television-ready,\\" Watts said. \\"But her rhetoric is just as radicalized, if not more, than Wayne LaPierre's.\\"      Loesch grew up in a blue-collar family in a small Missouri town near St. Louis, reared mainly by her mother after her parents' divorce. She told The Times that she recalls her grandfather hunting deer and raccoon, but also a night her grandfather stood on the porch with a shotgun to protect her aunt from an estranged husband.      \\"Looking back, I think I always wanted to know that I was safe,\\" she told the newspaper for an article published last month.      Loesch studied journalism at Webster University, but dropped out when she became pregnant with her first son. She soon began writing a blog about motherhood and started her radio program. She later helped found the St. Louis tea party and had stints as a political analyst at Breitbart News Network and The Blaze.      Loesch, who has said she keeps a handgun near her bed and has a tattoo on her forearm with a reference to a Bible passage calling for Christians to wear holy armor, has never been afraid of being provocative.      During a 2012 radio show, Loesch said she didn't have a problem with Marines who urinated on dead Taliban soldiers, declaring: \\"I'd drop trou and do it too.\\"      ___      Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| CLOSE Companies being urged to cut ties with the gun rights group, advocating a NRA boycott.

The NRA defended itself Saturday in a statement while condemning firms that have decided to cut off their relationship with the organization: \\"The law-abiding members of the NRA had nothing at all to do with the failure of that school's security preparedness, the failure of America's mental health system, the failure of the National Instant Check System or the cruel failures of both federal and local law enforcement.\\"      The NRA continued by saying that corporations who \\"decided to punish NRA membership is a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.\\"      \\"Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.\\"      The pro-gun lobby has come under sharp criticism, particularly from students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, for opposing efforts to curb the sale of semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 used in the shootings.      A Change.org petition calling on 25 companies to break ties with the NRA had received almost 7,000 signatures by Saturday morning.

In addition, Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku are under pressure to end streaming of the NRA's NRAtv.      Hollywood celebrities including \\"Law & Order: SVU\\" executive producer Warren Leight and actors Misha Collins, Evan Handler, Amy Hargreaves, Alyssa Milano, Tara Strong and Ally Walker on Thursday began pushing Amazon to stop streaming NRAtv, the NRA’s public relations channel, through Amazon Fire.      Amazon Fire is one of the most popular devices that allow people to watch Internet-streaming broadcasts through their television sets. Other video streaming products, including Google’s Chromecast, Apple TV, and Roku, were also under pressure to remove NRAtv from their services.      NRAtv features 36 channels which covering topics such as politics, hunting and gun collecting. Some of the most popular are talk show-like formats.

The NRA, initially a supporter of hunting, marksmanship, safety training, and common-sense gun laws, transformed its ideologies after a faction takeover in 1977. With many NRA members actually supporting policies contrary to those now promoted by the group, its sustenance relies heavily on corporate discounts and partnership, with companies such as MetLife, LifeLock, and Hertz contributing to funds. In response to recent shootings, calls have emerged for corporations to disassociate themselves from the NRA and for individuals to directly express displeasure to partner companies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  and the situation: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  Answer the following question: Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations?

Born in the Boloso Sore District of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn overcame many challenges to rise to the highest political offices in his country. He held various ministerial positions before becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs under the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in 2010. Following Zenawi's death in 2012, Desalegn assumed the mantle of Prime Minister, becoming the first person from a minority ethnic group — the Wolayta — to hold the nation's top office. While Desalegn's tenure as Prime Minister saw numerous difficulties, including territorial disputes with Eritrea and internal social and political unrest, he is also credited with maintaining Ethiopia's stability and directing the country along its modernization path. Essential infrastructure projects were launched during his reign, contributing significantly to shaping up the nation’s socio-economic outlook. The development of Addis Ababa is a crucial part of Desalegn's legacy. The city, often referred to as the \\"political capital of Africa\\" due to its historical, diplomatic, and political significance for the continent, has only grown in importance under Desalegn's leadership. The completion of the Addis Ababa City Hall, an iconic venue for public and national events and a symbolic representation of modern Addis Ababa, is a testament to the transformative agenda of his administration. Addis Ababa City Hall, situated in the heart of the city, represents the aspirations of Ethiopia as a nation striving forward. When the hall was completed, it not only provided a new administrative center for the city's government but also became a symbol of national pride. The building, encompassing traditional Ethiopian architectural elements and modern building technology, reflects the country's progress under Desalegn's administration. The building also hosts a range of government departments, fostering efficiency in civic administration and public service delivery. In conclusion, the tenure of Hailemariam Desalegn as the Prime Minister of Ethiopia left an indelible mark on the country's history, particularly in the concrete development visible in the capital city. The Addis Ababa City Hall, standing tall in the city's landscape, is one such testament to this transformative era — a symbol of Ethiopian resilience, progression, and aspiration for a better future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Air Hollywood K9 Flight School is one place where such help can be found. The school has a piece of equipment that provides the sights, sounds and even the feel of an airplane in flight. It is called a flight simulator . The simulator was built for filming airplane scenes in movies. Sandy Alexander lives in Newport Beach, California. He has a disability that requires his two-year-old dog, Doc, to be always at his side. Mr. Alexander took the dog to the flight school to get him ready for plane trips.

Thousands of British families due to leave the UK for a traditional Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the possibility of a green Christmas. Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 until December 13 after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy. But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow where inches of snowfall would usually have fallen by now. Scroll down for video. Heading for the mountains: Skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs (pictured here in the summer) - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow. At Les Arcs, which is made up of four resort villages, only one lift was in operation. Skiers were being bussed in from the resorts of Arc 1600, Arc 1800 and Arc 1950 to Arc 2000, where a single 0.6-mile (1km) piste was in operation. The resort’s daily ski report yesterday said the nearest fresh snow had fallen 77 miles (124km) away. One Briton, who owns a ski chalet in Arc 2000, said: ‘There is green and brown land visible all the way up the mountain which would normally be covered in snow. ‘Even Mont Blanc doesn’t look itself. There’s snow on the peak but it doesn’t look anywhere near as plentiful as usual.’ The skier, who did not want to be identified, added: ‘Some of the runs here are grey, with just a dusting of powder, rather than the glistening white scene which is normal at this time of the year.’ Locals blamed a freakishly warm November which melted an early winter snow dump at the lower resorts, and a shortage of atmospheric weather depressions which had brought few new snowfalls - even after the weather in the higher resorts dropped to the sub-zero temperatures which are normal for this time of year. In Arc 2000 - the four resorts are loosely named after the approximate altitude of each village - it is said by locals to be the worst conditions at the start of a ski season in 40 years. Put back: Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel (left) and Meribel (right, file pictures) Ski instructor Philippe Arnauld said: ‘At the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy, but from next weekend the resorts will be full for Christmas and New Year. ‘If all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall, perhaps only a few snowflakes, is predicted between now and Christmas. I have no idea what will happen and how we will manage.’ Last Thursday, Chris Fawkes, a BBC weather forecaster, tweeted that an ‘unlucky jet stream pattern this weekend’ was preventing the Alps from ‘getting significant snow’. The Paradiski is the second largest linked skiable domain in the world, with 264 miles of pistes over 14,390 hectares. As well as Les Arcs, it includes the resorts of Peisey-Vallandry and la Plagne. Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel and Meribel. They said the delays would not affect British holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of UK tour operators don’t start until late December. Until 25 years ago and the advent of efficient snow-making machines, most Alpine resorts did not open before mid-December, although the machines need the thermometer to fall to -4C to operate successfully. Val d’Isère, normally one of the most reliable resorts in Europe for snow cover, cancelled the men’s World Cup giant slalom and slalom races scheduled for this past weekend, despite investing in the largest snow-making machine in Europe. Temperatures in the resort on the first weekend of December had reached 5C. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario, where the soil becomes unsuitable for mushrooms and there are fewer mature mushrooms, is directly impacting a step of the process.  The life cycle of a mushroom starts with the dispersion of spores into the air, and these spores rely heavily on the quality of the soil once they land on the ground. The proper germination and mycelium growth are essential steps in the development of a new mushroom, and both of these steps are highly dependent on the suitability of the soil in which they take place. Good soil provides necessary nutrients, water, and other environmental factors needed for the successful growth of mushrooms. When the soil becomes unsuitable for the mushrooms, it directly impacts the germination of the spores and the subsequent growth of the mycelium. Unsuitable soil may lack the required nutrients, have improper pH levels, or contain harmful substances that inhibit mushroom growth. As a result, the process of germination may be hindered or even completely halted, and the growth of the mycelium may be stunted or abnormal, leading to fewer buds sprouting and, ultimately, fewer mature mushrooms. This perturbation directly affects one or more steps of the process because it targets the very basis of mushroom growth - the soil in which the spores are meant to germinate and the mycelium is meant to develop. Without suitable conditions for these key steps in the life cycle, the process cannot move forward as it should, rendering this perturbation as directly impacting the process. In summary, the supposed perturbation of the soil becoming unsuitable for mushrooms mainly directly impacts the germination and mycelium growth steps of the process. This leads to fewer mature mushrooms, as the necessary conditions for successful development are no longer met."},{"instruction":"Facts:   - instrument: guitar    - death place: canton , wales    - years active: 1966 -- 2005    - caption: tich gwilym performing in 1985    - birth name: robert gwilliam    - death date: 19 june 2005    - genre: hard rock , blues-rock , progressive rock , reggae      - birth date: 10 september 1950    - name: tich gwilym    - image size: 300px    - background: non_vocal_instrumentalist    - image: tich . jpg gwilym -lrb- aberystwyth , november 1985 -rrb- -1    - birth place: llwynypia , wales    - associated acts: kimla taz , superclarkes , mrs hugget , budgie    - occupation: musician   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of tich gwilym .","output":"Tich Gwilym, born Robert Gwilliam on September 10, 1950, in Llwynypia, Wales, was a renowned Welsh musician known for his skills as a guitarist.

Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, the park includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Fort Tilden. While Gateway National Recreation Area houses several forts and parks across New York City's boroughs, including Fort Wadsworth and Great Kills Park on Staten Island, Fort Tilden is not among them. Fort Tilden is located in Queens on the western Rockaway Peninsula and is an important part of the recreation area within that borough. Gateway National Recreation Area is a vast and diverse entity managed by the National Park Service, which offers various recreational and educational options for visitors and residents alike. The area includes sites, parks, and resources spread across three New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Within Staten Island, the recreation area encompasses two main locations: 1. Fort Wadsworth: This historic fort played a crucial role in defending New York Harbor from the Revolutionary War to the end of World War II. It features the pre-Civil War era Battery Weed, built between 1845 and 1861, and Fort Tompkins, which served as a coastal gun battery. Fort Wadsworth also offers breath-taking views of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn. 2. Great Kills Park: Featuring beaches, nature trails, a public marina, and numerous sport facilities, Great Kills Park is an excellent destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The park's name \\"Great Kills\\" derives from the Dutch term for \\"many creeks,\\" and it reflects the park's location at the mouth of several tidal wetlands. Fort Tilden, on the other hand, is situated in the borough of Queens and offers different opportunities for visitors to explore its historical significance. The fort served as a strategic coastal defense site from the First World War until the early Cold War period. Today, it provides visitors with access to a stretch of beautiful beach, the historic battery installations, walking and biking trails, and a nature preserve. In conclusion, Fort Tilden is the fort you will not find on Staten Island as it is located in Queens. Gateway National Recreation Area encompasses a variety of parks and sites across New York City, offering visitors the chance to explore the region's rich history and natural beauty. While Staten Island's contributions to the recreation area include Fort Wadsworth and Great Kills Park, Fort Tilden stands as an important and distinct feature of the recreational space in Queens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Striking gold: Earthquakes deposit precious metal      PARIS — Solid gold can be deposited in Earth's crust \\"almost instantaneously\\" during earthquakes, said a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Sunday.      The gold is formed when a tremor splits open a fluid-filled cavity in the Earth's crust, causing a sudden drop in pressure, according to a team of Australian researchers.      This, in turn, causes the fluid to expand rapidly and evaporate, and any gold particles that had been dissolved in it to \\"precipitate almost immediately\\", said a Nature press release.      \\"Repeated earthquakes could therefore lead to the build up of economic-grade gold deposits.\\"      The researchers said much of the world's known gold was derived from quarts veins that were formed during geological periods of mountain building as long as three billion years ago.      The veins formed during earthquakes, but the magnitude of pressure fluctuations or how they drove gold mineralisation were not known.      For this study, researchers used a numerical model to simulate the drop in pressure experienced in a fluid-filled fault cavity during an earthquake.      In so doing, they answered a long-standing question about the world's gold resources -- how the metal becomes so concentrated from a highly dissolved state to a solid, mineable one.      The study said single tremors would not generate economically viable gold deposits, which were built up one thin coating at a time.      To form a 100 tonne gold vein deposit would take less than 100,000 years, the team wrote.      Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More » ||||| The tyrannosaur of the minerals, this gold nugget in quartz weighs more than 70 ounces (2 kilograms).      Earthquakes have the Midas touch, a new study claims.      Water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold, according to a model published in the March 17 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience. The model provides a quantitative mechanism for the link between gold and quartz seen in many of the world's gold deposits, said Dion Weatherley, a geophysicist at the University of Queensland in Australia and lead author of the study.      When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a rupture in the ground — a fracture called a fault. Big faults can have many small fractures along their length, connected by jogs that appear as rectangular voids. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs.      About 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica and economically attractive elements like gold.      Shake, rattle and gold      During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. It's like pulling the lid off a pressure cooker: The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces, suggest Weatherley and co-author Richard Henley, of the Australian National University in Canberra.      While scientists have long suspected that sudden pressure drops could account for the link between giant gold deposits and ancient faults, the study takes this idea to the extreme, said Jamie Wilkinson, a geochemist at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study.      \\"To me, it seems pretty plausible. It's something that people would probably want to model either experimentally or numerically in a bit more detail to see if it would actually work,\\" Wilkinson told OurAmazingPlanet.      Previously, scientists suspected fluids would effervesce, bubbling like an opened soda bottle, during earthquakes or other pressure changes. This would line underground pockets with gold. Others suggested minerals would simply accumulate slowly over time.      Weatherley said the amount of gold left behind after an earthquake is tiny, because underground fluids carry at most only one part per million of the precious element. But an earthquake zone like New Zealand's Alpine Fault, one of the world's fastest, could build a mineable deposit in 100,000 years, he said.      Surprisingly, the quartz doesn't even have time to crystallize, the study indicates. Instead, the mineral comes out of the fluid in the form of nanoparticles, perhaps even making a gel-like substance on the fracture walls. The quartz nanoparticles then crystallize over time. [Gold Quiz: From Nuggets to Flecks]      Even earthquakes smaller than magnitude 4.0, which may rattle nerves but rarely cause damage, can trigger flash vaporization, the study finds.      \\"Given that small-magnitude earthquakes are exceptionally frequent in fault systems, this process may be the primary driver for the formation of economic gold deposits,\\" Weatherley told OurAmazingPlanet.      The hills have gold      Quartz-linked gold has sourced some famous deposits, such as the placer gold that sparked the 19th-century California and Klondike gold rushes. Both deposits had eroded from quartz veins upstream. Placer gold consists of particles, flakes and nuggets mixed in with sand and gravel in stream and river beds. Prospectors traced the gravels back to their sources, where hard-rock mining continues today.      But earthquakes aren't the only cataclysmic source of gold. Volcanoes and their underground plumbing are just as prolific, if not more so, at producing the precious metal. While Weatherley and Henley suggest that a similar process could take place under volcanoes, Wilkinson, who studies volcano-linked gold, said that's not the case.      \\"Beneath volcanoes, most of the gold is not precipitated in faults that are active during earthquakes,\\" Wilkinson said. \\"It's a very different mechanism.\\"      Understanding how gold forms helps companies prospect for new mines. \\"This new knowledge on gold-deposit formation mechanisms may assist future gold exploration efforts,\\" Weatherley said.      In their quest for gold, humans have pulled more than 188,000 tons (171,000 metric tons) of the metal from the ground, exhausting easily accessed sources, according to the World Gold Council, an industry group.

Original article on LiveScience's OurAmazingPlanet. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A study published in the journal Nature Geoscience suggests that earthquakes can deposit solid gold in Earth's crust almost instantaneously. According to a team of Australian researchers, when an earthquake occurs, it splits open a fluid-filled cavity in the Earth's crust, causing a sudden drop in pressure which leads to the fluid expanding rapidly and evaporating. As a result, any gold particles that had been dissolved in the fluid precipitate almost immediately. Repeated earthquakes can thus lead to the build-up of economic-grade gold deposits. The study provides a quantitative mechanism for the link between gold and quartz seen in many of the world's gold deposits and sheds light on how gold becomes so concentrated from a highly dissolved state to a solid, mineable one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: The Dark Knight Returns (alternatively titled Batman: The Dark Knight Returns) is a 1986 four-issue comic book miniseries starring Batman, written by Frank Miller, illustrated by Miller and Klaus Janson, and published by DC Comics. When the series was collected into a single volume later that year, the story title for the first issue was applied to the entire series. The Dark Knight Returns tells an alternative story of Bruce Wayne, who at 55 years old returns from retirement to fight crime and faces opposition from the Gotham City police force and the United States government. Context: Despite the cost of the single-issue packaging, The Dark Knight Returns sold well. Priced at 2.95 an issue, DC Comics promoted The Dark Knight Returns as a \\"thought-provoking action story\\". Time said the series' depiction of a \\"semi-retired Batman [who] is unsure about his crime-fighting abilities\\" was an example of trying to appeal to \\"today's skeptical readers\\".  IGN Comics ranked The Dark Knight Returns first on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels and called The Dark Knight Returns \\"a true masterpiece of storytelling\\" with \\"[s]cene after unforgettable scene.\\" In 2005, Time chose the collected edition as one of the 10 best English language graphic novels ever written. Forbidden Planet placed the collected issue at number one on its \\"50 Best of the Best Graphic Novels\\" list. Writer Matthew K. Manning in the \\"1980s\\" chapter of DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle (2010) called the series \\"arguably the best Batman story of all time.\\" It was placed second in a poll among comic book academics conducted by the Sequart Organization.  The series also garnered some negative reviews. In April 2010, Nicolas Slayton from Comics Bulletin ranked The Dark Knight Returns second in his Tuesday Top Ten feature's Top 10 Overrated Comic Books behind Watchmen. Slayton wrote, \\"[t]here is no central plot to the comic, leaving only a forced fight scene between Superman and Batman as an out of place climax to the story.\\" \\"Gone are the traits that define Batman,\\" also citing \\"misuse of the central character.\\" The New York Times gave the 1987 collected release of the series a negative review. Mordecai Richler felt that The Dark Knight Returns was not as imaginative as the work of Batman creator Bob Kane. Richler commented, \\"The stories are convoluted, difficult to follow and crammed with far too much text. The drawings offer a grotesquely muscle-bound Batman and Superman, not the lovable champions of old.\\" He concluded, \\"If this book is meant for kids, I doubt that they will be pleased. If it is aimed at adults, they are not the sort I want to drink with.\\" Question: What did people think of the novels?. Whats the answer?","output":"People had varied opinions on The Dark Knight Returns. Many praised the series and considered it a masterpiece of storytelling, with some ranking it as one of the greatest Batman graphic novels and among the best English language graphic novels ever written. However, there were also negative reviews, with some critics feeling that the plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, and that the character portrayals deviated from the originals.

Article: Mark Kelly prepares for a flight in a NASA T-38 trainer jet in August 2010. David Dehoyos/NASA      President Donald Trump and his administration are angling to create a Space Force, a sixth branch of the military that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie.      On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence set a deadline for its creation: \\"Our administration will soon take action to implement these recommendations with the objective of establishing the United States Department of the Space Force by the year 2020,\\" Pence announced.      Neither the White House nor the Pentagon can create a Space Force without the approval of Congress, though Trump has pushed for the plan many times since becoming president.      At a meeting of the National Space Council on June 16, Trump said, \\"we are going to have the Air Force, and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal.\\"      The idea is part of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law in December and defines the force as \\"a separate military department responsible for the national security space activities.\\" It asks the Defense Department to submit a final plan for its structure and functions by December 31.      But retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly — a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, four-time space-flyer, and the identical twin brother of the former astronaut Scott Kelly — doesn't support the plan, and some members of Congress have also voiced their distaste for the idea.      \\"This is a dumb idea. The Air Force does this already. That is their job,\\" Mark Kelly tweeted in June, following Trump's remarks. \\"What's next, we move submarines to the 7th branch and call it the 'under-the-sea force?'\\"      Kelly reiterated that point yesterday.      \\"There is a threat out there but it's being handled by the US Air Force today,\\" he said during an MSNBC interview, according to Reuters. \\"[It] doesn't make sense to build a whole other level of bureaucracy in an incredibly bureaucratic DoD.\\"      Why the US already has a Space Force      An augmented-reality demonstration by the Air Force Space Command. USAF      Kelly was referring to the Air Force Space Command, though the group has had different names over the years.      Space Command is headquartered in Colorado, and its responsibilities include supporting military use of satellites, rocket launches, and cyberwarfare operations. The group also helps track the countless pieces of space junk and debris around Earth that pose a persistent threat to anything in orbit.      Space Command is managed by US Strategic Command, one of 10 groups that direct major pieces of the Defense Department. Its responsibilities include oversight of the country's nuclear-weapons capabilities, which involves space because long-range, nuclear-tipped missiles fly through space.      In July 2016, Space Command even announced the creation of a Space Mission Force, which military leadership said was akin to an expeditionary force.      Red dots are known pieces of China's destroyed FY-1C satellite. Green dots are low-Earth orbit satellites. Celestrak/Analytical Graphics, Inc.      This force was created in part to quickly respond to outer-space attacks from adversaries. The main countries of concern are Russia, which continues to publicize new weaponry, and China, which destroyed one of its own satellites in a 2007 test with a \\"kill vehicle\\" — essentially a giant bullet launched by missile.      \\"Despite world interest in avoiding militarization of space, potential adversaries have identified the use of space as an advantage for US military forces, and are actively fielding systems to deny our use of space in a conflict,\\" Gen. John E. Hyten, the commander of US Strategic Command, wrote in a white paper about the decision in 2016, when he led Space Command.      The Trump administration wants to peel these space-related capabilities from the Air Force, however, and form a new division entirely.      For and against a Space Force      Sen. Bill Nelson. Aaron Bernstein/Reuters      Some members of Congress, especially those in the House of Representatives, appear warm to the idea.      \\"As we get all these briefings about what adversaries are doing, our dependence on space, it's clear that we have to do better,\\" Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters in early June, according to Space News. \\"Organizational changes don't fix all the problems. But on the other hand, they can sometimes help make sure space gets the kind of priority it should have, like cyber, as a domain of warfare.\\"      But others in Congress — and apparently some high-ranking military officials — have, like Kelly, questioned and pushed back on the idea of a Space Force.      \\"The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don't want,\\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida tweeted on June 18. \\"Thankfully the president can't do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake.\\"      Stationing or testing any weapons of mass destruction in space, including nuclear weapons, is banned by the United Nations' Outer Space Treaty of 1967. While peaceful use and exploration is permitted, smaller-scale weapons are not explicitly barred, and experts fear that militarizing space with them could stoke a costly new arms race.      A war in space might also lead to something called a Kessler event. In this scenario, uncontrolled space debris could collide and create even more uncontrolled space debris, ultimately shutting off human access to space for decades, if not centuries.

Zakharova said during a news briefing in Samara that Russia \\"noted the U.S. president's instructions...to separate space forces from the air force,\\" saying, \\"The most alarming thing about this news is the aim of his instructions, namely to ensure [U.S.] domination in space.\\"      Zakharova accused the United States of \\"nurturing plans to bring out weapons into space with the aim of possibly staging military action there.\\"      She warned that if realized, such plans would have a “destabilizing effect on strategic stability and international security.\\"      While Russia has a branch of the military called \\"space forces,\\" their activities are \\"purely defensive,\\" the spokeswoman insisted.      Based on reporting by AFP, Interfax, and TASS ||||| Trump said this week he will establish a sixth branch of the military named the “Space Force,” pending budgetary approval from the U.S. Congress. The idea could require the U.S. to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which prohibits the deployment of weapons of mass destruction but not conventional arms in space.      Russia has pledged severe repercussions if President Donald Trump’s order to set up a new, space-oriented military branch violates a treaty banning nuclear weapons in the cosmos.      Viktor Bondarev, head of the Committee on Defense and Security of Russia's upper parliamentary house, told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency he hoped “there’s still remnants of common sense in the American political elite” that would compel the U.S. to remain in the pact.      “But if the U.S. withdraws from the treaty, then of course, not only ours but other states will follow with a tough response aimed at ensuring global security,” Bondarev told RIA on Tuesday.      In the U.S., analysts noted that the proposed space force would likely face complications, delays or outright rejection after the 2020 presidential election.      “The militarization of space is a path toward catastrophe,” Bondarev, the former head of Russia’s Aerospace Forces, stressed.

Given the question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

The situation on the Korean Peninsula has been volatile and unpredictable for decades, and while recent developments, such as the historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, may signal a new era of cooperation, there are still significant obstacles to overcome. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this issue include: 1. Historical tensions: The Korean Peninsula has been divided since the end of World War II and the Korean War. Trust between the North and the South, as well as between North Korea and the United States, has been exceedingly low due to the long-standing animosity. 2. Political and ideological differences: North Korea is a totalitarian regime, while South Korea and the United States are democracies with different political systems and ideologies. This creates potential obstacles in aligning interests and finding mutually agreeable resolutions. 3. Military concerns: North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and missiles, which has increased tensions and raised concerns about regional security. Additionally, the joint US-South Korea military exercises have been a point of contention for North Korea. 4. Economic sanctions: International sanctions against North Korea have been in place for years, making it difficult for the country to develop economically. A resolution would likely require some form of sanctions relief, which may be controversial and difficult to negotiate. 5. Unpredictable leadership: Both North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump are known for their unpredictable behavior, which makes it difficult to forecast the outcome of diplomatic efforts. Given these challenges and unpredictable factors, it is not possible to determine an exact timeline for reaching a resolution between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States.

There are a number of ways to dance — alone in your room, out at a club with your friends, or even by taking a dance class such as tap, jazz, foxtrot, or swing dancing. Whatever form of dance you encounter, you'll be able to move your body, listen to the lyrics, and live in the moment. It doesn't matter if you're a terrible dancer. In fact, that you would get you even more focused on your dance moves and less focused on all of your niggling thoughts. Taking up a dance class would be a great way to start a new hobby and to dance. Get outside and start looking at the trees, smelling the roses, and feeling fresh water on your face. That will help you live in the moment, embrace nature and the impermanence of your existence, and to see a world outside of the one you created inside your own head. Put on your sunblock and your sneakers and stop being cooped up in your bedroom.  Even if you're not into hiking, running, biking, or surfing, make a goal of walking through a park at least once or twice a week, taking a weekend trip to something nature-related with your friends during your next vacation, or just going somewhere were you can stare out at a big blue lake or ocean. And if that seems like too much work for you, just go outside. Being out in the sun will make you happier, healthier, and less likely to brood. Focusing on the thoughts of other people will not only give you insight, but will keep you from thinking about yourself too much. In fact, reading biographies of inspirational men and women \\"of action\\" may inspire you to see that behind every great thought, there is an equally great action. And reading books can also not make you want to do anything except for escape to a new world for a while, which is also nice. Every day, make a list of at least five things you are grateful for. This will make you focus on people and things instead of thoughts. If every day is too much, try doing it every week. Mix it up. Every little thing counts, even the barista who gives you a free refill of your coffee. Listening to a great song can make you feel in touch with the world outside your own head. You can do this by going to a concert, playing an old CD in your car, or even getting a record player and some LPs and going old school. Close your eyes, soak in the notes, and live in the now. It doesn't have to be Mozart or something meaningful or hoity-toity. Listening to Katy Perry can do the trick too! more. Be around people who make you laugh. Go to a comedy club. Watch a comedy or a TV show with a funny cast that you really like. Watch some funny YouTube videos. Do whatever you have to do to make yourself crack up, toss your head back, and not care about all of the things that are on your mind. Don't underestimate the importance the role of laughter plays in your mental health.

A the first step in this process, USAID provided specialized software and helped Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek national energy companies develop country-specific models for their national electricity transmission systems. Translate to Russian","output":"На первом этапе этого процесса Агентство США по международному развитию (USAID) предоставило специализированное программное обеспечение и помогло национальным энергетическим компаниям Казахстана, Кыргызстана, Таджикистана и Узбекистана разработать индивидуальные модели для их национальных систем передачи электроэнергии. Агентство США по международному развитию (USAID) подошло к решению этой задачи весьма основательно. Первым шагом стало предоставление специализированного программного обеспечения для анализа и моделирования электросетей. С помощью этого инструмента национальные энергетические компании смогли точнее оценить потребность в передаче электроэнергии, учесть особенности своих энергосистем и идентифицировать возможные узкие места и проблемы. Во второй части проекта, USAID организовало обучающие сессии и семинары для сотрудников национальных энергетических компаний по применению предоставленного программного обеспечения и разработке стратегий в области энергетики. Это позволило специалистам углубить свои знания в области энергоинформатики, а также научиться составлять долгосрочные и краткосрочные планы по обеспечению надежного функционирования электросетей. Следующим шагом было внедрение полученных знаний и опыта на практике. В результате совместной работы национальных энергетических компаний с экспертами из USAID удалось разработать стратегии управления электросетями для каждой страны. Отметим, что при создании этих стратегий учитывались не только национальные особенности, но и международные элементы, такие как региональное сотрудничество в области энергетики и обмен электроэнергией между соседними странами. Конечным этапом в реализации проекта USAID следует считать проведение экспертизы разработанных стратегий и подготовка дополнительных рекомендаций для их улучшения. Помимо этого, участники проекта активно обсуждали возможности применения новых технологий и методов управления электросетями, что способствовало генерации идей для дальнейшего развития энергосектора в регионе и повышения его конкурентоспособности на мировом рынке энергоресурсов. Таким образом, благодаря надежному и эффективному партнерству между USAID и национальными энергетическими компаниями Казахстана, Кыргызстана, Таджикистана и Узбекистана получили мощную основу для модернизации и дальнейшего развития своих систем электропередачи, что будет способствовать устойчивому росту экономики и благополучию населения в регионе."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: We always celebrated Dad's birthday on Thanksgiving Day, even after he entered a nursing home. When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him.

The mere mention of its name sparks image conjuring, from brooding castles perched atop misty hills to supernatural beings that haunt the darkest corners of your psyche, Transylvania, Romania, rings with a thrilling resonance. This land breathing with ageless lore has woven countless tales that intermingle reality and the mystical, leaving the audience entranced. Let us journey together through time's weft and delve into the mystical tales from Transylvania. Perhaps the most iconic of all Transylvanian folklore is the legend of Dracula, the infamous vampire Count. Rooted in the historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, known for his brutal and bloodthirsty reign, this character was reimagined by Bram Stoker as a shadowy, immortal vampire. The notorious Dracula's Castle, Bran Castle, standing starkly amidst the Carpathian Mountains' peaks, fuels the fear and fascination of visitors till today. The grim walls of this fortification whisper tales of the Count's nocturnal exploits, feeding the vampire lore that thrills both locals and foreigners alike. Yet, Dracula’s tale is but one thread in Transylvania’s vast tapestry of myths and legends. Transylvania's fascinating folklore is often tinged with elements of the otherworldly, and a prime illustration of this is the story of the 'Solomonari'. These legendary wizards, trained in an otherworldly school hidden in the mountains, were believed to have controlled the weather. Locals whispered that they could ride dragons, summon rain, and pull together mighty storms. The Solomonari's tales interweave the fabric of Transylvania's mystical allure, adding to its intricate narrative. The Transylvanian landscape is dotted with hauntingly beautiful forests, each one possessing its own mystical tale. Among them, the Hoia Baciu Forest, often referred to as the \\"Bermuda Triangle of Transylvania\\", is known for its eerie occurrences. Stories of unexplained phenomena, including UFO sightings, ghostly apparitions, and instances of lost time, plague this forest. Its twisted, charring vegetation and the strange sense of anxiety that besets those who dare to venture within its bounds, propagate its otherworldly influence. Another lesser-known but equally intriguing tale is that of the 'strigoi', the troubled spirits rising from the grave. These entities, subtly different from the concept of a vampire, are a vital part of rural folklore. Often entangled in tales of unrequited love and betrayal, strigois are said to wander the earth, causing unrest and torment. In the heart of Transylvania, tales of cryptic werewolves also run rampant. While the werewolf's notion is universal, Transylvanian folklore adds its unique flavor. Here, werewolves were once warriors or wronged individuals, cursed to bear their lupine affliction. Just as Dracula's myth veils every corner of Transylvania, the werewolves become a part of their everyday superstitions, further solidifying Transylvania's mystical stories. Embedded deeply within Transylvania's cultural identity, these fantastical tales form an extensive narrative that continues to allure and inspire people worldwide. Each tale, whether it’s about the solitary vampire, the legendary Solomonari, the spirit-stricken strigoi, the mysterious happenings in the Hoia Baciu forest, or the cursed werewolves, contributes to the rich tapestry of Transylvanian folklore. Transylvania's narrative pits reality against fantasy, the visceral against the ethereal, urging us to slip into a world seen through the mystical lens. These mystical tales from Transylvania, the beating heart of Europe, keep pulsating with life, mingling and intertwining with everyone who ever dares to venture into the mesmerizing world of this storied land. Imbued with tales of the supernatural and the extramundane, Transylvania offers a window into an enigmatic world that tilts the quotidian towards the magical."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Herbert A. \`\` Herb '' Magidson ( January 7 , 1906 -- January 2 , 1986 ) was an American popular lyricist . His work was used in over 23 films and four Broadway reviews . He won the first Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1934 .  - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job.

I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding.

It implies that the speaker is commenting on the trials someone might face during such a situation. However, the hypothesis in question is: \\"You have to shovel when it's forty below zero and the snow is a foot deep.\\" The hypothesis is discussing the necessity of shoveling snow when the temperature is very low (forty below zero) and the snow is a specific depth (a foot deep). This statement is concerned with the condition under which shoveling is necessary or required. By examining both statements together, we can see that they discuss two different aspects of the topic.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Nevada ghost town that was once underwater By Johnny Simon2015-08-09 05:03:54 UTC St. Thomas, Nevada was founded by Mormon settlers in 1865 near the banks of the Muddy River. Originally believing they had settled in Utah, the Mormon pioneers were attracted to the large salt deposits in the surrounding area. Most of the Mormons abandoned the town after they discovered they were actually in Nevada and owed three years of state taxes. A new wave of settlers brought in farmers, and St. Thomas’s population peaked at roughly 500. That all changed in 1936 with the completion of the Hoover Dam. The dam caused water levels of the Colorado River to rise, creating Lake Mead, one of the world’s largest reservoirs, in its wake. St. Thomas had to be abandoned and its townspeople relocated. Over the past decade, however, widespread drought, and growing regional water usage has caused water levels of Lake Mead to drop, and with it, the formerly submerged town has resurfaced.

Consumers are advised to throw out all prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough products. The company said it is recalling an estimated 300,000 cases of the dough as a precaution after reports of food-borne illness in 28 states. There are concerns that the premade dough may be contaminated with the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7, which causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Mary is casting a blank stare off to nowhere seeming to look through Carrie so","output":"utterly lost in her own world, one could not help but wonder what could possibly be occupying her thoughts so heavily. While her tranquil expression belied a sense of calm, her unresponsiveness seemed to suggest that her mind was grappling with complex emotions, memories, or perhaps some deeply ingrained conundrums. Carrie, in that moment, felt compelled to reach out and make an attempt to bridge the chasm that appeared to have opened up between them. She hesitated, however, concerned that she might inadvertently shatter the fragile tapestry of thoughts that Mary had so intricately woven. Is it best to intervene, or to simply allow Mary this moment of solitude, Carrie pondered. As the seconds stretched on, seemingly elongated into eternities, Carrie couldn't help but speculate at the numerous possibilities of what could have brought Mary into this solitary reverie. Perhaps her mind had wandered back to her tumultuous childhood, where strong emotions of both love and loss were intertwined with the formation of her identity. Or maybe it was the painful memory of a romantic relationship gone awry, leaving her heartbroken and scarred, yet infinitely wiser for the experience. Mary's distant gaze could have also been a reflection of her current state of affairs -- grappling with the pressures of a successful career while attempting to maintain a balanced lifestyle, while also shouldering the responsibilities of various personal commitments. Could it be that her seemingly perfect life was beginning to unravel at the seams, only to be kept in place by the sheer mental fortitude and stoicism she exhibited? Or, perhaps just as likely, Mary was lost in contemplation of the future. Carrie was aware that Mary had long dreamed of embarking on a life-changing journey, possibly traveling to distant lands to immerse herself in their cultures and traditions. Could it be that in these precious moments of disconnect from reality, Mary was mentally preparing herself for such an adventure, wondering what obstacles, triumphs, and invaluable lessons awaited her on the horizon? As Carrie's own thoughts churned and raced to decipher Mary's enigma, she found herself becoming gradually more attuned to the beauty in the unspoken connection that moments like these could foster. For even as they stood physically apart, locked in their respective introspections, their silent camaraderie allowed both women to embark on their own emotional voyages, firmly anchored by the knowledge that the other's unwavering support and understanding awaited them upon their return. Eventually, Mary's blank stare dissolved and her eyes softened as they refocused on the world around her. The fleeting moment of disconnection had given way to a renewed clarity, as her unwavering gaze met Carrie's once more. An unspoken understanding passed between them, encased within a simple, warm smile that said more than words ever could."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PUBLISHED:. 04:08 EST, 12 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:28 EST, 12 November 2013. Meeting someone new isn't always the easiest of tasks, so spare a thought for China's young women who face intense parental pressure to find the right man. As a result, women terrified of returning home without a handsome other half resort to hiring 'boyfriends' for the duration of their visit. Now a shopping website, Taobao, has launched a new rent-a-boyfriend service which allows would-be fake other halves to advertise their services - complete with price lists. False romance: Women under pressure are resorting to fake boyfriends in a bid to impress their families. According to Chinese newspaper, the People's Daily, rent-a-boyfriends must be hired for a minimum of three days and offer a range of services including dinner (50 yuan, approximately £5) and shopping trips (30 yuan, approximately £3), on top of their 30 yuan hourly fee. Other services include seeing a film, although you will have to pay double if the movie is a thriller, and a 50 yuan peck on the lips, although hand-holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek or forehead are free. 'I wanted to earn some pocket money when I had just graduated from university and started to work,' explains one advertiser, 27-year-old Matthew Fang from Chongqing. 'This rental business isn’t bad, especially during the Chinese Lunar New Year when there are family reunions.' End game: The women are searching for someone to marry but make do with a stand in while the hunt goes on. And business is booming for a reason. Chinese women in particular still face enormous parental pressure to meet a suitable man and rather than face a barrage of questions from nosy relatives, hire their men instead. According to Fang, the recruitment process begins with a preliminary meeting to discuss the client's requirements and to get their back story straight. Typically, the pair will exchange photos and will have a rehearsal before going ahead with the rental. Despite the detailed list of services and attempts - on both sides - to keep relations professional, some of the rent-a-boyfriends admit that it can, at times, be difficult. 'It all depends on how you look at it,' says another fake boyfriend, 26-year-old Xu Li from Yancheng City. 'If you look at it as a business, then it’s much easier.' The New York Observer has pinpointed a new phenomenon which sees wealthy Americans reject real friends in favour of a paid entourage. A fashion designer, who was anonymously quoted in The Observer’s piece much like rest of the article’s sources, told the paper: ‘There is a market, a currency for paid friends in New York. Some people need the money, and some people need the friends.’ But while being a paid friend might sound like an easy way to make a living, it's not always champagne bars and lavish dinners. ‘You’re always on someone else’s schedule — sort of like being a pet monkey,’ said one paid friend who lives between New York and LA. 'Being a paid friend is complicated,' he continued. 'When you’re in the presidential suite, it’s amazing, sometimes it can be emasculating, but I put my ego away a long time ago.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Chinese women under intense parental pressure to find a suitable partner are resorting to hiring fake boyfriends through a rent-a-boyfriend service provided by shopping website Taobao. 2. Boyfriends for hire offer various services, such as dinners and shopping trips, and must be hired for a minimum of three days. 3. The rental business thrives during family gatherings like the Chinese Lunar New Year. 4. The client and the fake boyfriend discuss requirements and rehearse their backstory before the rental period. 5.

The ring went down the drain..","output":"Based on the given premise, we can infer various potential effects or consequences. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let us discuss each potential effect separately, as mentioned: 1) The woman polished the ring: One potential effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower is that it may have caused her to clean or polish the ring. This could be due to several reasons: a) Realization of the ring's condition: When the ring slipped off her finger, she might have noticed that the ring had collected dirt, grime, soap scum, or other build-ups over time. This realization would prompt her to polish the ring to restore its shine and beauty effectively. b) Protection from further incidents: After the incident where her ring slipped off, the woman might have wanted to prevent such incidents in the future. Polishing the ring could be her way to remove any slippery residues that might have caused the ring to become loose, thus ensuring it fits better on her finger. c) Emotional attachment: If the ring holds sentimental value for the woman, the incident may have triggered her emotional attachment to it, and thus, take better care of the ring. Polishing the ring is an act of cherishing her memories and attachment to it. 2) The ring went down the drain: Another potential effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower is that it might have gone down the drain. In this case, various scenarios can be explored: a) Panic and immediate action: Losing the ring down the drain could lead to a sense of panic and urgency to retrieve it. The woman would be stressed about the loss and may attempt to retrieve it by taking apart the drain, using a drain snake, or improvising with other tools. The retrieval process might be time-consuming, and if unsuccessful, cause even greater distress. b) Calling a plumber: If the woman is unable to retrieve the ring herself, she could call a plumber for professional assistance. Consequently, there could be financial implications since hiring a plumber might be costly. Additionally, the plumber would need to access her home, which may cause a level of inconvenience and disruption to her daily routines. c) Emotional distress: Losing the ring down the drain could lead to emotional distress for the woman if the ring had sentimental value or memories attached to it. She might feel guilty for being careless, grief for the loss, and anxiety about the uncertainty of recovering the ring. d) Complications in relationships: If the ring was a symbol of her relationship with a significant other, the loss could cause complications in the relationship. The significance of the lost ring might lead to miscommunication or feelings of disappointment, especially if the ring was a gift or an engagement/wedding ring. e) Replacement: In the unfortunate event that the ring cannot be recovered, the woman might consider replacing it. Depending on the ring's value, seeking a replacement could be costly, time-consuming, and potentially emotionally unfulfilling due to the sentimental value attached to the original ring. Hence, the effect of the woman's ring slipping off in the shower can lead to various potential consequences depending on whether she decided to clean or polish the ring or lost the ring down the drain. Both situations come with their own set of implications on the woman's emotional state, actions taken, and possible changes in her relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas. BIRTHS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After we were rather disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'Tarzan and his Mate,' was the best in the series. It's true. I got a huge kick out of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging, animal dueling wild super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love Jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). In my review for 'Ape Man,' I stomped on Jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. She acts as the ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets. She's even got her own jungle scream now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She's totally got him trained. Cheeta is quite charming as well, taking drags off of Martin's cigarette. The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. The effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting stuff. KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure, nothing holds a candle to 'Tarzan and His Mate.' The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass, violent and risqué jungle epic. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does. You'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be Code-approved, or Animal Rights-approved for that matter. The gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies. And after T&J enter the picture, there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims. See it for yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film. In the first film, Jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that. But here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema. Although she still requires Tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams, she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued. Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched this with my Mom, and I enjoyed pointing out to her just how much Jane has Tarzan \\"trained,\\" as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call. Although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film, there is still plenty of hair-raising Tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed (mostly) for real. That and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around. **SPOILER** The film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two humans still breathing. Although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, I can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find Tarzan and Jane and were never heard from again. **END SPOILER** One of things that still bothers me is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth, hairless bod and over-styled coif. Other than that, this is pre-Code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed. Last film: It Happened One Night (1934). Next film: Twentieth Century (1934).

The sooner you get a Florida driver's license (or Non-Driver ID) the better. If you already have a license from another state, you will not have to take the written or driving tests to get a Florida license. For the record, you have 30 days after filing the Declaration of Domicile to get a Florida driver's license (you may get a Florida license with or without this declaration, which we’ll discuss in the second section). To get your license:  Bring your out-of-state license to your local Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (county tax collector). Take an identify document with you too, such as the original or certified copy of your birth certificate.  It's also okay to bring a US Passport, or a Certificate of Naturalization. Provide proof of your Social Security number. This could be your Social Security card, a W-2 or pay stub. Offer two documents that prove your Florida address. A mortgage deed, Florida car registration or recent utility bills are the most commonly accepted, but anything with your new address should suffice. If you don’t intend to drive, you need to get a Non-Driver ID card. This is the same exact process as getting a Driver’s License (without any tests, of course). Transfer your car title and get registration for your car ‘’in Florida’’. You have 10 days after establishing Florida residency status to complete this task.  Get car insurance in Florida. Submit proof of your policy to the county tax collector. Show the original title to the county tax collector. Bring the car you want to register to your county tax collector's office, so they can check out the VIN. Pay the fees. It costs around 400 to title and register your car for the first time in Florida. You will also have to pay the typical registration fees, which vary depending the age, type, and weight of your vehicle. It is convenient to do this while getting your Florida driver's license  – often at the DMV (county tax collector) they will attach a voter registration form along with your new address forms. However, you can also register with the Supervisor of Election. You must wait until the voter registration books open, as they close 30 days prior to an election and reopen after an election. This is a simple form that takes about 5 minutes to fill out. After you hand it in, your work is done.

Let's break down and discuss each aspect of the phrase in detail. 1. Cruelly funny: The word 'cruelly' has a negative connotation, indicating that the humor stems from a sense of cruelty or harshness. This could be perceived as negative, as some people might find this type of humor offensive or inappropriate. However, the word 'funny' serves as a positive aspect, pointing out that the comedy is still meant to be entertaining and elicit laughter. Hence, the intended humor might appeal to those who enjoy dark or mature comedy, giving it a positive spin. 2. Twist on teen comedy: The phrase 'twist on teen comedy' suggests that the creators are trying something different or innovative with the genre, altering the classic elements of teen movies. This can be considered positive since it might provide the audience with a refreshing experience or a new perspective on familiar themes. However, the twist might also cause a divide among viewers, depending on their tastes and preferences for genre experimentation. Taking both aspects into account, the phrase \\"a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy\\" offers a mixture of positive and negative connotations. It is positive in the sense that it presents a unique and potentially entertaining take on the genre, while the negative aspect lies in the possibility of alienating certain audiences who may find the humor too harsh or inappropriate.

Article: Left unfettered  , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed   hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \\"age compression  \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade.

How is \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" said in Russian?","output":"To express \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" in Russian, you first need to transliterate the original Portuguese terms into Cyrillic script and adjust for the Russian pronunciation. In this case, the transliteration for \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" would be \\"Итапарика, Баия.\\" Now, let's provide a detailed explanation of the transliteration: 1. The Portuguese name \\"Itaparica\\" is comprised of the following sounds: /i/, /t/, /a/, /p/, /a/, /ɾ/, /i/, /k/, and /a/. To transliterate these sounds into Russian, we'd write: - /i/ as И - /t/ as Т - /a/ as А - /p/ as П - /ɾ/ as Р (the Russian \\"Р\\" is a voiced trill, similar to a Portuguese \\"R\\" in certain positions) - /k/ as К So, \\"Itaparica\\" becomes \\"Итапарика\\" in Russian. 2. For \\"Bahia,\\" we'll start with the Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation, which sounds like /baˈia/. To transliterate this into Russian, we'd write: - /b/ as Б - /a/ as А - /i/ as И - /a/ as А Thus, \\"Bahia\\" is written as \\"Баия\\" in Russian. As a result, \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" would be expressed as \\"Итапарика, Баия\\" in Russian. It's important to note that the city and the state are still referred to by their Portuguese names in Russian conversations and texts, but they are simply respelled using the Cyrillic alphabet and adjusted for accurate Russian pronunciation. Please note that Russian speakers may still understand the original spelling in Latin script, especially when discussing international locations or during interactions with foreign speakers of Portuguese or other non-Russian languages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A child looks at the sky while laying among some early autumn leaves. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we can analyze various aspects to determine whether it supports the hypothesis.  Premise: A little child with a hat on lays on the grass amid a few scattered fallen leaves. Hypothesis: A child looks at the sky while laying among some early autumn leaves. 1. Subject: Both the premise and the hypothesis feature a child as the primary subject, suggesting a potential correlation. 2. Position: The child's position is described as \\"laying\\" in both the premise and the hypothesis, further supporting the connection. 3. Surroundings: The presence of fallen leaves in both the premise and the hypothesis indicates that the scene occurs during the early autumn season. The hypothesis explicitly states \\"early autumn,\\" while the \\"scattered fallen leaves\\" in the premise imply a similar time frame as leaves typically fall in the early months of autumn. However, there are a few elements that are not explicitly mentioned in either the premise or the hypothesis which makes it difficult to make a definitive conclusion. 1. Child's focus: The hypothesis states that the child is \\"looking at the sky,\\" whereas the premise does not mention the child's focus or gaze. It's possible that the child may be looking at the sky or could be focusing on something else, like the leaves or some other object in their surroundings. 2. The child's attire: The premise mentions that the child is wearing a hat, while the hypothesis does not specifically mention this detail. While this discrepancy does not directly conflict with the hypothesis, it does highlight a difference in the provided information. In conclusion, while there are several overlapping aspects between the premise and the hypothesis, the absence of crucial information in the premise, specifically regarding the child's gaze, makes it impossible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is accurate. It is plausible that the child could be looking at the sky, but without a clear indication of the child's focus, a concrete conclusion cannot be determined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose childhood was spent in Knutsford?  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

The Police were a British rock band formed in London in 1977. For most of their history the band consisted of Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s and are generally regarded as one of the first new-wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the United States. In October 1979, the group released their second album, Reggatta de Blanc, which topped the UK Albums Chart, and became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. The album spawned the hit singles \\"Message in a Bottle\\" (No. 1 UK, No. 2 Canada, No. 5 Australia) and \\"Walking on the Moon\\" (No. 1 UK). The album's singles failed to dent the US top 40, but Reggatta de Blanc still hit No. 25 on the US album charts.  The band's first live performance of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" was on the BBC's television show Rock Goes to College filmed at Hatfield Polytechnic College in Hertfordshire. The instrumental title track \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In February 1980, the single \\"So Lonely\\" was re-issued in the UK. Originally a non-charting flop when first issued in late 1978, upon re-release the track became a UK top 10 hit, peaking at No. 6.  In March 1980, the Police began their first world tour, which included places that had seldom hosted foreign performers---including Mexico, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greece, and Egypt. The tour was subsequently documented in the film The Police Around the World (1982), directed by Kate and Derek Burbidge, which encompasses footage shot by Anne Nightingale originally intended for a BBC production The Police in the East.  In May 1980, A&M in the UK released Six Pack, a package containing the five previous A&M singles (not including \\"Fall Out\\") in their original sleeves plus a mono alternate take of the album track \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" backed with a live version of \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\".

Internet taunts: Rebecca Adlington, 23, re-Tweeted an abusive message sent to her - horus after winning another event in Barcelona. Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington has outed a Twitter troll who sent her an abusive message online - days after complaining about being subjected to vile taunts. The 23-year-old was called a 'whale' with a 'shark fin nose' in the abusive Tweet, she revealed yesterday hours after scooping gold in the 800m freestyle in Barcelona. The message was apparently sent by Callum Aspley, a 19-year-old Leeds Metropolitan University undergraduate who is himself a keen sportsman. However, he has denied sending it at 11pm on a Saturday night – and blamed it on one of his friends. Miss Adlington re-Tweeted the message for her 51,000 followers to see and said it was a ‘perfect example’ of the abuse she has had to endure. The swimmer, who won the 400m and 800m freestyle events at the Beijing Olympics, has vowed to ignore the internet altogether during this summer’s games. The abusive message said: ‘you shark fin nosed ******** , you belong in that pool you ****ing whale.’ Yesterday she received a stream of supportive Tweets from her followers. One fan wrote: ‘Becky, that's just a lowlife - ignore him because you know how talented you are x’ Miss Adlington, a 400m and 800m freestyle champion, revealed last week she has received a number of vile messages from 'idiots'. She said: ‘I used to read all the stuff about me. I learned very quickly not to do that. ‘It is awful. Even if there are ten nice comments you get one idiot. I’ve now given up. It upsets me or gets me angry. ‘They are to do with how I look, which has nothing to do with my performance in the pool. It’s just nasty comments about things  I can’t control. I can’t help the way I look.’ She said: ‘I don’t know how people expect to send a nasty message and not get blocked. I won’t be checking Twitter or going on it a lot during the Games. Abuse: The vile message sent from @CallumAspley re-Tweeted by Rebecca Adlington as the 'perfect example' of the offensive remarks she has received. Rebecca Adlington has said she will avoid the internet completely during the Olympics. ‘The messages of support are amazing but you do have the chance of someone saying something that is going to be annoying. You don’t want that added stress. You don’t want to be thinking about that. I think I will just tweet once it is over.’ It is not the first time Miss Adlington, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has been publicly abused over her looks. In 2009, BBC panel show Mock The Week was censured after broadcasting ‘nasty’ comments about her by comedian Frankie Boyle. Reflecting on the BBC incident, the swimmer said: ‘It’s hard for a woman. A guy doesn’t get comments on his weight or his looks. But for women it is difficult because we get criticised for our weight or how we look.’ The double Olympic champion won gold again on Saturday in the 800m Freestyle in Barcelona in the Mare Nostrum series. She put in an assured performance and recorded a championship record time of 8 minutes 19.86 seconds. Adlington led from the front and built up a lead of over two seconds at the halfway stage, finishing strongly ahead of Spain's Mireia Garcia Belmonte, the world short-course silver medallist. Today the student behind the Twitter account that the abusive message was sent from had not yet responded to a request for comment from the MailOnline. He has however taken his Twitter page down. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I didn't send the tweet myself, I was out with my mates and one of them got hold of my phone and so he must have sent it, it wasn't me. ‘I don't use Twitter a lot and I don't know how to delete a tweet. ‘Obviously I don't agree with what was said, I wouldn't say that kind of thing.’ He added that he does not usually use Twitter and would delete the message. The undergraduate, who plays for his university rugby team, previously played rugby and cricket for his secondary school in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He has refused to name who was actually behind the abusive message. Golden girl: Rebecca Adlington celebrates with one of the two gold medals she won in Beijing four years ago.

Q:What is the full name of the building which exact location early on is unknown?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on...

It is part of the Whangarei District, a local body created in 1989 to administer both the city proper and its hinterland from the former Whangarei City, Whangarei County and Hikurangi Town councils. The city population was estimated to be up from 47,000 in 2001. The wider Whangarei area had an estimated population of 85,900 in 2015.  - Hikurangi is a settlement in Northland, New Zealand. The city of Whangarei is 17 km (11 miles) to the south, and Kawakawa is 39 km (24 miles) northwest. The Glenbervie Forest is southeast of the settlement. State Highway 1 once passed through the town, but now bypasses it to the west. Mount Hikurangi is a volcanic dome rising 365 metres (1,198 ft) to the west of the town. It is 1.2 million years old, and part of the Harbour Fault which also includes Parakiore, near Kamo, and Parihaka in Whangarei.  - Kamo is a small township north of Whangarei , approximately five minutes drive from the Whangarei CBD . The name is a Mori word meaning \`\` eyelash '' , but has also been said to mean \`\` to bubble up '' , referring to hot springs in the area .

Process:  - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   suppose more clean energy produced happens, how will it affect more coal is burned.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The supposed perturbation from producing more clean energy while more coal is burned would be: indirectly impacting a step of the process. To further elaborate on this, let's break down the scenario and its effects on the process of acid rain formation due to burning coal. When more clean energy is produced, it can lead to a decrease in the dependence on coal as a primary energy source. Clean energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power, do not produce sulfur emissions or other pollutants that contribute to the formation of acid rain. Over time, as the use of clean energy sources increases, there will be a gradual shift from relying on coal-based power plants to relying more on these cleaner energy sources. This change will indirectly impact the first step of the process: burning coal. As the demand for coal-based power generation decreases due to an increase in clean energy production, it will result in less coal being burned, which will ultimately lead to a decrease in sulfur emissions. This, in turn, affects the subsequent steps in the process as well, as lesser sulfur compounds will be released into the atmosphere, thus reducing the formation of sulfuric acid and eventually making the rain less acidic.  However, it is important to note that this perturbation does not directly impact any individual step in the process of acid rain formation due to coal burning. Instead, the indirect impact arises from a broader shift in the energy landscape, causing a change in the emissions produced. By increasing clean energy production and reducing our dependence on coal, we can help mitigate the environmental damage caused by acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may be uncomfortable perpetuating the Santa story or feel discomfort about lying to your child, and those are legitimate concerns shared by many. On the other hand, you may want your child to believe in something whimsical and magical, like Santa. How to deal with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision that can only be made by your family. Remember, though, that even if you do not share the Santa story in your own family, your child might still come to you with tricky questions about Santa. Perhaps they heard something at school or they have thought about the Santa story and it doesn't completely make sense. Acknowledge the question and praise them for their critical thinking. This is actually a positive developmental step. Determining their reason for asking will help you figure out the best way to proceed.  You might give this question some thought before it ever comes up, so that you are not caught completely off guard. This will help you respond more thoughtfully and slowly, rather than be reactionary. Ask your child very plainly, \\"Why do you ask?\\" or \\"Where is this question coming from?\\". Just because the child is asking questions doesn't necessarily mean that they are emotionally ready to believe the truth. They may just be curiously probing. Asking what your child believes will give you an idea of where they are emotionally and cognitively. If your child indicates that they still believe in Santa, despite any outside doubts, it's likely not time to tell them the truth yet. Respond to your child's question with a simple, \\"Well, what do you believe?\\" This allows them to reflect on what they think and whether or not they believe in Santa Claus. When your child answers your question about what they believe, they will tell you that they don't think Santa is real, or that they do but that they have questions.  This answer should guide how you proceed and you can either tell them the truth about Santa or let them continue to believe. They may also say that they do believe the story of Santa Claus, but are confused about something specific in the Santa story, such as how he gets around the world in one night, or fits all of the presents in one bag.  Just reiterate whatever you've already told them and answer questions as best as you can. Summary:","output":"Dealing with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision for each family.

As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the grandfather paradox because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived. This view doesn't simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveler would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveler moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the Novikov self-consistency principle. What principle elaborates more on the view described?","output":"The Novikov Self-Consistency Principle elaborates more on the view described. This principle, formulated by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov, asserts that any event in a time travel scenario must be self-consistent. Thus, any action taken by a time traveler in the past must have already been a part of history and cannot cause any paradoxes or change the established events in their timeline. Essentially, the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle maintains that the timeline is a fixed, unchangeable structure where all events, including the actions of time travelers, are already integrated and predetermined in a consistent way. This principle prevents the possibility of causality-based temporal paradoxes, such as the grandfather paradox, since it ensures that the past cannot be altered in a way that would contradict already established events. In this perspective, time travelers cannot create a new timeline or change the present by altering the past. Instead, their actions in the past have always been a part of the timeline and are coherently woven into the fabric of time. This principle not only preserves the consistency of historical events but also implies that the concept of free will might be limited or even non-existent for time travelers trying to change the past. By adhering to the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle, the potential problems and logical inconsistencies presented by time travel can be mitigated, leading to a more coherent and stable understanding of the effects of time travel within the context of a predetermined and self-consistent timeline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways.

Zinni feared that  Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

Suggested answer: Frida Kahlo de Rivera (born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón; July 6, 1907 – July 13, 1954) was a Mexican painter , born in Coyoacán , who is best known for her self-portraits. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"The suggested answer provides some background information about Frida Kahlo but does not specifically address the question of how she died. To provide a more accurate and comprehensive answer to the question, the following information should be included:  Frida Kahlo, the renowned Mexican painter, passed away on July 13, 1954. Although the exact cause of her death remains somewhat uncertain, the official cause was given as a pulmonary embolism. It is important to note that Kahlo had endured numerous health issues throughout her life, which could have potentially contributed to her death. Born in Coyoacán, Mexico on July 6, 1907, Kahlo experienced a tumultuous life filled with illness and injury. At the young age of six, she contracted polio, which left her with a withered and weakened right leg. Later, in 1925, she was involved in a serious bus accident that left her with severe injuries, including fractures in her spine, pelvis, and ribs, and a shattered right leg. This accident would have lasting effects on her life, leading to more than 30 surgical interventions and chronic, debilitating pain. In addition to her physical health issues, Kahlo also faced mental health struggles, including depression and anxiety. The physical and emotional pain she experienced was often depicted in her art, making her paintings intensely personal and reflective of her reality. Throughout her life, Kahlo was hospitalized multiple times for various health issues, and in 1950, she underwent spinal surgery. Unfortunately, this surgery did not provide relief from her chronic pain, and she would continue to be hospitalized in the years leading up to her death. In the last months of her life, Kahlo's health deteriorated rapidly, and her leg was amputated due to gangrene. Some biographers have also suggested that she may have had other medical conditions, such as spina bifida or multiple sclerosis, which could have contributed to her declining health. Given the political climate in Mexico and her romantic relationship with Leon Trotsky, some have speculated that her death was not as straightforward as officially claimed. Rumors of suicide have circulated, given her fragile mental health and the fact that she had previously attempted to take her own life. However, despite these speculations, the official cause of her death remains listed as a pulmonary embolism. In conclusion, while the suggested answer provides useful information about Frida Kahlo's life and career, it does not directly address how she died. An accurate and comprehensive answer should include her cause of death, as well as the various health issues and personal struggles she faced that may have contributed to it, such as the pulmonary embolism, her physical disabilities and chronic pain, and her mental health disorders."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Usage: In this example, the date and time statement is \\"August 26, 2003 occured after 14 January 2000 but before Aug 19, 1983\\". The identified template is \\"t1 occured after t2 but before t3\\". This statement fits this template because t1 (August 26, 2003) is being compared as occurring after t2 (14 January 2000) and before t3 (Aug 19, 1983). Part #2: Convert the date and time string values into a comparable format.

As a result, the Earth's surface heats up. 3. The Earth changes energy from the Sun into heat, which warms the Earth's surface and the planet's atmosphere. 4. Heat rises from the ground and radiates back into the cooler atmosphere. 5. Greenhouse gas molecules (such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane), present in the atmosphere, absorb and trap the outgoing infrared radiation (heat energy), preventing it from easily escaping into space. 6. This trapped heat energy warms up the Earth's atmosphere and surface, causing the global temperature to increase. This is known as the \\"greenhouse effect.\\" 7. As the temperature continues to rise over time, global warming gets accelerated, which leads to melting of polar ice caps. 8. As more ice melts, it releases water into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise. Additionally, the reduced ice cover reduces the Earth's albedo (its ability to reflect sunlight), leading to even more solar radiation being absorbed and further increase in global temperatures. 9.

Ballet Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Dancing in the Spotlight\\" Genre: Drama/Family Plot: Act 1 Setting: Oaksville, a small town in the heartland of the USA. Joe (late-30s, single father, works in the local factory) and Payton (12 years old tomboy, aspiring athlete) are a close-knit family due to the tragic passing of Payton's mother a few years prior. They both struggle with the void left in their lives, but find solace in their shared love of sports. Payton is a talented athlete, participating in various sports such as soccer, basketball and track; she dreams of one day going to the Olympics. One day, Payton's school hosts a career fair to expose young students to various professions and hobbies. Among the booths is one from a prestigious ballet academy, the Oaksville Ballet School. The owner of the ballet school, Victoria (an elegant woman in her late 50s, with a mysterious air around her), visits Payton's school to promote the academy. During the fair, Payton reluctantly follows her friend, Lily, to the ballet booth. Joe is also in attendance as a chaperone. Victoria notices Payton's strong physique and nimble movements during the career fair, which reminds her of a prodigy she once trained. She approaches Joe and tells him that Payton has a natural talent for ballet and that she would like to offer her a full scholarship at her ballet academy. Joe, seeing the potential of a ballet scholarship as a way for Payton to get an excellent education and secure her future, signs her up despite Payton's reluctance. Act 2 Payton arrives at her first session at the ballet academy but feels out of place surrounded by girls in tutus and leotards. Her initially dismissive attitude towards ballet starts to change when she realizes the physical demands and athleticism involved in the art. As time goes by, she discovers a new sense of discipline, rhythm, and grace. Joe attends all her practice sessions, motivated by an unexpected appreciation for the art of ballet. He is surprised to see the impact it has on Payton's life as she grows into a well-rounded individual. At the same time, Victoria recognizes Payton's raw talent and takes her under her wing, training her rigorously. Despite Payton's many setbacks and the snide remarks from fellow students, she doesn't give up and works hard to overcome the criticism. Act 3 The Oaksville Ballet School is invited to perform at a prestigious ballet competition. With just three months to go, Payton is chosen to lead the troupe. Her fellow students, unhappy with her position, start to see the value in Payton's efforts after witnessing her dedication and unwavering passion for the sport. The ballet troupe comes together and starts to bond as a team. Joe and Payton forge an even stronger relationship through her ballet training, as Joe learns more about the world of ballet from Victoria, who reveals that his wife trained with her for a short period, and ballet was her secret passion - a connection both Joe and Payton had unknowingly shared with her. During the competition, Payton's performance dazzles the audience and the judges, and the Oaksville Ballet School ends up winning the competition. The troupe's newfound camaraderie creates lasting friendships, and Payton realizes that she can be both an athlete and a ballet dancer. The movie concludes with Joe and Payton embracing each other, proud of their victory and the journey to self-discovery. Through ballet, they find a new connection not just with each other, but with Payton's mother, who left a legacy of strength, grace, and resilience for them to carry forward. \\"Dancing in the Spotlight\\" is a heartwarming story about the power of family, friendship, and the pursuit of one's passion even when the odds are stacked against you.

If a new BabyCenter poll is any guide,  _ .A surprisingly large number of parents still insist that their children practice such old-fashioned manners as putting pen-to-paper to say thank you,treating adults with respect and addressing adults as \\"Mr., Mrs.or Miss.\\"A majority of the 1,000 parents surveyed also said they insist at dinner that children keep napkins in their laps,ask to be excused from the table and refrain from talking with a full mouth. Among the reasons cited most often by parents,BabyCenter says,is that \\"the world is a more free-wheeling place,and they want to give their kids a stronger moral compass to guide them.\\"This thinking was affirmed by 64%of those surveyed.And 58%say they see so many badly behaved kids around them that they're determined to raise their children differently. This poses a particular challenge for parents who work outside the home and must find a sitter, nanny or other child-care provider who will insist on the manners they consider most important. Pediatrician Perri Klass wrote recently in the New York Times about her annoyance at a rude,demanding child who was among her longtime patients.Although she veiled her injunctions to the mother in euphemisms ,talking to her about \\"setting limits,\\"Dr.Klass wrote,\\"I do pass judgment on kids with bad manners and so does every pediatrician I know.\\"Rude kids make her wonder whether there is something wrong with the family,among other things,she says.\\"The whole 'manners' concept might seem a bit odd,\\"she says,\\"until you recast it as 'social skills' a hot-button child-development issue,as I wrote in a recent column.\\" Readers,what manners do you insist upon for your children?

He, his classmates...everyone knew it. Sparky never asked a classmate to go out in high school. He was too afraid of being refused. However, one thing was important to Sparky - drawing. He was proud of his artwork. Of course, no one else appreciated it. In his senior year of high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the Yearbook. Although the cartoons were turned down, Sparky was so confident about his ability that he decided to become an artist. After completing high school, he wrote a letter to Walt Disney Studios. He was told to send some samples of his artwork, and the subject for a cartoon was suggested. Sparky spent a great deal of time on it. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios. He had been rejected once again. Another loss for the loser. So Sparky decided to write his own autobiography in cartoons. He described his childhood - a little boy loser and underachiever.

Armando works part-time at his parents' restaurant and is also a custodian at a dance studio, where he secretly practices dance moves. He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin, a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel. She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: CreditEmon Hassan for The New York Times The bowl of ragged-edged pork belly is a recipe from Bhutan, the meat vested with the deep sour of fermented bamboo shoots. Its flavor hints at turned earth or wood broken down by rain, a funk wonderfully, perilously close to rot. Beside it is risotto, arborio rice gone cloudy and fat in white wine and a stock of fennel and artichoke scraps, finished not with cheese, but peas freshly shucked and tasting still new to the world. The two dishes emerge from the same kitchen at Dawa’s, a Tibetan and American cafe in Woodside, Queens. This feels not like a hyphenation, but a continuum: one table, one life. Dawa Bhuti runs the restaurant with her father, Ngodup Gyaltsen, and an uncle, Lobsang Tenzin. Her family roots are in Dzonga, Tibet, a village in the Himalayas at an altitude of some 13,500 feet. It is a place she has never been. She was born across the border, in Kathmandu, Nepal, and she spent much of her youth in India at boarding schools for Tibetan refugees, before coming to New York in 2004 at 20. Now she cooks alongside her father, who joined her in the United States three years ago. He used to circumambulate the city, delivering homemade lunchboxes to Tibetans working at farmers’ markets; she went to culinary school and did stints at Mercer Kitchen, Rouge Tomate and, most recently, Reynard, whose loyalty to local farms and the seasons is reaffirmed at Dawa’s. The front side of the menu, posted at each table on a small chipped clipboard, is hers, devoted to brunch dishes (served all day) of almost Californian lightness. These may include a pale soup of leeks and radishes, inscribed with basil oil like a memory of another alphabet, or baked eggs under a litter of summer squash and garlic scapes. Pan-seared wild cod, in folds of soft corn tortillas, comes armed with half-spears of asparagus. A rosary of chickpeas dusted with Ethiopian berbere is strewn among lettuce leaves so vivid, they look as if they were still beaded with dew. The cooking is lovely, if occasionally more dramatic in appearance than flavor. (An ambitiously tall fried-chicken sandwich wanted salt and a less looming, umbrella-like bun.) But the thrill is the hidden tracks, listed on the back of the menu as ethnic plates, Mr. Bhuti’s contribution from the hometown he had to leave behind. Gyuma is a stark black sausage, filled with beef blood, tripe and heart, heavy on bulgur wheat and contoured with emma, the Tibetan name for numbing Sichuan peppercorn. Under it lies a swath of sepen, the mandatory Tibetan hot sauce, as pure an expression of raw chile power as I’ve known. Ground beef is sealed inside flaking pastry disks for shabaley, the meat moist from a dash of beef bone broth, lush with marrow. Momos, Tibetan dumplings, are slightly doughier than elsewhere in town, with grainy whole-wheat skins surrounding beef sweated with shallots and more delicate white-flour skins around chicken laced with curry powder, Nepali-style. I wished everything had come with tingmo, a snowy coil of a steamed bun. It was spongy and resilient, good for softening the scorch of sepen or catching the last bit of rust-red sauce under the momos, a slow distillate of tomatoes, onion and fenugreek, bitter inextricable from sweet. Ms. Bhuti took over the Woodside storefront, formerly an outpost of Lety Bakery, last August but kept everything the same, waiting until the spring to renovate and introduce a new menu. (She still stocks the baked goods.) Now there are rustic tables and mismatched chairs, forks and knives with hammered copper handles, bulbs showing off their filaments and a potted plant growing on nearly every table. Food is presented in the kind of exquisite, idiosyncratic ceramic plates I’m used to seeing at hushed Japanese restaurants. Here, too, they give a meal an element of reverence. (A sign on a shelf says: “You like it? Inquire in the front.”) Where at other restaurants the artisanal, farm-to-table ethos can sometimes take on the gloss of fetish, for Ms. Bhuti it seems simply a natural inclination. She likes the feel of dirt on farmstand vegetables and the touch of things made by hand. She sanded down her drinking glasses from old wine bottles, and she once dressed the dining room with branches rescued from a fallen tree. Behind the restaurant, she tried to improvise an egg-carton greenhouse. “Not everything came out,” she said. She hopes one day to transform the yard into a place for dinner guests. “Secret-garden-like,” she said. “With wildflowers.” Recommended Dishes Bhutanese pork belly with tingmo; shabaley; momos; stir-fried noodles; wild cod tacos; baked eggs.

A:","output":"The task requires you to create a question from a given fact. In this context, the fact you are given is \\"Sweating increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body.\\" • The first step is to identify key parts of the sentence that you could potentially turn into a question, for example, the subject (sweating) or the effect (increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body). • The guidelines say to consider replacing parts of the fact with a 'WH' word. WH words include: who, what, where, when, why, and how. • A rule to consider here is that the question you create should check scientific understanding. Therefore, the question should be based on scientific facts or principles. • The task also allows for the creation of a question without a WH word. Let's apply these steps: One possible way to create a question from this fact is: What increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body?  In this question, the WH word \\"what\\" replaces \\"sweating\\". \\"Sweating\\" then becomes the answer to the question. This question checks for understanding of body temperature regulation, which is a scientific topic.  An example without a WH word could be: \\"Sweating increases the amount of heat transferred from the body?\\" Here, the statement is turned into a question by simply adding a question mark at the end, turning the statement into a yes/no question with the answer being \\"yes\\". This also evaluates scientific understanding as someone would need to know how sweating affects body temperature to correctly answer this."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US143.9 billion) respectively.

Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of Detecting Relationship Changes Early: 5 Red Flags That May Indicate Trouble Introduction: Strong and healthy marriages are built on mutual trust, respect, open-minded communication, and the willingness to understand and accept one another. However, relationships are dynamic and go through different phases. The connection may change due to factors such as stress, work-related situations, financial struggles and family matters. Paying close attention to your partner's behavior can reveal if there's a shift in the relationship dynamics or if your marriage might be facing some trouble. In this article, we will delve deep into how husbands can identify possible red flags in their marriages, outline five crucial signs to watch out for, and suggest how to address them. Our focus is on creating awareness and encouraging couples to work together to build a stronger relationship and lead a happier life. 1. Increased Complaints and Unresolved Conflicts An early warning sign of potential marital issues is if your wife starts to complain more about you or your relationship. This could be a clear indication that she's unhappy or that some aspects of the marriage are bothering her. It is essential to foster an open and non-defensive discussion in which both parties feel heard and understood. Avoid dismissing her concerns or taking them personally. Instead, consider the possibility that she may be expressing herself to find solutions and better the relationship. 2. Changes in Sexual Desire Intimacy and sexual connection play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy marriage. If your wife's desire for sex has drastically decreased or she appears disinterested, it may suggest that there's an underlying issue that needs attention. It's essential to be gentle and understanding and not see this as a personal rejection. Engage in open communication to determine whether there may be external factors affecting her libido, such as stress, fatigue, or health problems. Work together to rekindle the passion in your relationship. 3. Lack of Emotional Intimacy In any relationship, emotional intimacy sets the foundation for trust, empathy, and a secure connection. If you experience a decrease in emotional intimacy with your wife, such as sharing less about your day or avoiding personal conversations, this might indicate potential marital discord. Instead of dismissing these changes, take the initiative to encourage more open and honest communication. Share your emotions, feelings and concerns regularly, fostering a strong emotional bond. 4. Increased Need for Privacy Another sign that something may be amiss in your relationship is if your wife suddenly desires more privacy. If she spends more time alone or starts closing the door when she is in the room, it may suggest that she’s trying to distance herself from you. Respect her need for space and privacy, but be sure that you both maintain open lines of communication and address any concerns that may arise. 5. Increased Screen Time In the age of technology and social media, spending more time on one's phone is not unusual. However, if your wife is constantly on her phone in your presence, neglecting your conversations or being secretive about her usage, it may be a red flag. Foster healthy boundaries around screen time, ensuring that both of you spend quality time together and engage in productive communication. Conclusion: Marriages are evolving, complex, and dynamic entities, and couples must be aware of the potential red flags in their relationships. Understanding the signs that indicate possible marital discord is crucial for maintaining a strong and healthy connection with your spouse. However, detecting these signs alone isn't enough. The key lies in open communication, empathy, and understanding each other's needs while working together to overcome the challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Salazar Aims to Streamline Offshore Wind Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced a broad-based initiative on Tuesday aimed at accelerating the development of offshore wind power projects on the Outer Continental Shelf along the nation’s Atlantic coast. The initiative is intended to shave years off an uncertain permitting process that developers say can drag on for the better part of a decade, discouraging potential investors. Mr. Salazar unveiled the initiative during a news conference in Baltimore, where he was joined by other Interior Department representatives and Maryland and Delaware officials. The announcement comes a day after state regulators in Massachusetts approved a plan by National Grid, a regional utility, to buy part of the power to be generated by the Cape Wind offshore wind farm planned for Nantucket Sound. That project has been hampered by legal wrangling, federal reviews and other roadblocks for nearly a decade. The Interior Department finalized a lease with developers of Cape Wind last month. “The Cape Wind lease is an historic milestone in America’s renewable energy future,” Mr. Salazar said in a prepared statement. “But to fully harness the economic and energy benefits of our nation’s vast Atlantic wind potential we need to implement a smart permitting process that is efficient, thorough and unburdened by needless red tape.” The new program, called the “Smart From the Start” wind energy initiative, is modeled after a similar scheme meant to accelerate the adoption of solar power in the West, Mr. Salazar said. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the Interior agency that supplanted the dysfunctional Minerals Management Service after the BP oil spill in the gulf, will work with officials in several Atlantic states — including Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, Rhode Island and Massachusetts — to identify sites for potential development within the next 60 days. Feasibility and environmental assessments of those sites would commence as early as January, according to the Interior’s plan, with an aim of offering leases in areas deemed appropriate by the end of next year or early in 2012. Current regulations governing leases on the Outer Continental Shelf would also be tweaked to allow for more streamlined lease sales in cases where only one qualified developer is involved — although the change would be subject first to a 30-day public comment period. The oceans agency would also work to help fast-track other necessary reviews and permits tied to other agencies, and to aggressively process applications for new transmission infrastructure that would be needed to handle electricity generated by proliferating offshore wind farms. Google and a New York financial firm announced plans last month to invest in a 5 billion transmission backbone for future offshore wind farms. Andrew Sharpless, the chief executive of the environmental organization Oceana, welcomed Mr. Salazar’s announcement. “Ocean wind power is the good witch to the bad witch of ocean oil drilling,” he said in a statement. “We are pleased that the government is welcoming the good witch to our shores. “People need jobs and energy,” he said. “Ocean wind power, unlike ocean oil drilling, is a great way to do both.”","output":"Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has announced an initiative to accelerate the development of offshore wind power projects on the Outer Continental Shelf along the Atlantic coast.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Given the question: This article: Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again. When Mary then goes to Uncle Albert's workshop she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called N.C.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring? ?  People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.  William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

However, her dream died when the new heart started not to work properly. The doctors had to take it away. She needed another heart transplant  . But the doctors couldn't find a proper heart so soon. Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said. Living without a heart for 118 days -- that's great. When a heart transplant doesn't work, doctors have no time to waste.

Bob Corker launched into a Twitter spat Sunday morning in a major public falling out, making the Tennessean the latest senior Republican lawmaker to openly criticize Trump over his statements online and off.      Trump tweeted Sunday morning in a series of posts attacking Corker that he denied the senator's request for an endorsement -- a claim denied by Corker's chief of staff, Todd Womack, later in the day.      \\"The president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\\" Womack said in a statement.      Trump told Corker he was going to endorse him the day the Tennessee Republican announced his intention to retire, two sources familiar with the discussions said.      Corker, whose term expires at the end of next year, made the announcement that he would retire late last month.      Trump's slams on Corker come days after the senator made public comments criticizing him. The senator responded to Trump's tweets with an insult later in the morning, calling the White House \\"an adult day care center\\" in a Twitter post.      And he wasn't done there.      In remarks to The New York Times published on Sunday night, Corker said Trump was treating the presidency like \\"a reality show,\\" making reckless threats against other countries that put the United States \\"on the path to World War III.\\"      Corker also said Trump acts \\"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,\\" and that alarmed the senator, according to the Times.      \\"He concerns me,\\" Corker told the newspaper. \\"He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\\"      And the risks Trump's behavior presents also concern some of his top officials, who endeavor daily to protect the President from his own instincts, the Times reported.      \\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him,\\" Corker told the newspaper.      The flare-up between the two leaders highlights the long-simmering differences between GOP leaders and the President, who has not shied away from attacking the leadership over their inability to move health care legislation. It also comes as Trump prepares to press Congress to advance his proposed tax overhaul and tensions reportedly grow between Trump and members of his own Cabinet -- especially Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- on issues such as the way to handle North Korea's nuclear weapons program.      Corker's vote will be critical on tax reform, and he remains an influential voice on Trump's foreign policy challenges, including over how to handle the Iran nuclear deal.      It's not the first time Trump and the White House have privately sent one signal to Corker while publicly saying something else. Following Corker's pointed attack on Trump for his handling of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Vice President Mike Pence quietly sought to repair ties with Corker after the President knocked the Tennessee Republican on Twitter, sources said.      On Sunday morning, Trump again launched an attack on Corker.      \\"Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without...\\" Trump tweeted . \\"..my endorsement).

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017      The President continued to slam Corker in a tweet in the late afternoon.      \\"Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\\" he wrote.      Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done! — Donald J.

Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.\\"      It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017      Former US Attorney Preet Bharara, now a senior legal analyst at CNN, retweeted Corker's response, remarking, \\"An adult day care center whose chief resident can't count to 51.\\"      An adult day care center whose chief resident can't count to 51... https://t.co/QnXl8tDJm3 — Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) October 8, 2017      Bharara was fired by Trump a few months into his presidency.      Later Sunday, California Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu expanded on Trump's relationships with members of Congress, saying Corker's response highlighted why Republicans have not been able to pass major legislation this year.      \\"Donald Trump is a weak President with low approval ratings who does not command respect on Capitol Hill,\\" Lieu told anchor Ana Cabrera on \\"CNN Newsroom.\\" \\"As a result, Trump can't deliver the votes when he needs it. And to make matters worse, Donald Trump is not trying to build relationships. He lashes out and insults members of Congress. And keep in mind, Trump's deficit-exploding tax plan can only lose three Republican Senate votes before it dies.\\"      \\"I wish I could replay what people tell me on the floor from my colleagues across the aisle,\\" Lieu continued. \\"I can't do that, but they are similar to Senator Corker. I could just say this, the President is not respected by many members of Congress. You're seeing that play out in terms of failed legislation, and you see that played out when the President goes after and singles out individual members of Congress and attacks them. That's not how you build relationships.\\"      Corker, who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, defended his record on the Iran deal in an op-ed in The Washington Times last year, saying he led Senate opposition to the Obama-era pact and was joined by almost the entire Senate and House in passing legislation in 2015 to establish a process for congressional review.      \\"Without it, there would have been no requirement that Congress receive full details of the deal; no review period for Congress to examine and weigh in on the agreement; no requirement that the president regularly certify that Iran is complying; and no way for Congress to rapidly reimpose sanctions should Iran cheat,\\" Corker wrote.      The senator has also made some critical comments about Trump's demeanor and temperament in recent weeks.      Corker said in August that Trump had not yet demonstrated \\"the stability nor some of the competence\\" he needed to be successful.      Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \\"help separate our country from chaos.\\" He said Wednesday that Tillerson,Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \\"help separate our country from chaos.\\"      Corker also said Tillerson has not received the support he needs from Trump.      \\"I mean, look, I see what's happening here,\\" Corker said. \\"I deal with people throughout the administration and (Tillerson), from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place, where, as I watch, OK, and I can watch very closely on many occasions, I mean you know, he ends up being not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be supported, that's just from my vantage point.\\"      Tillerson, who has reportedly been displeased with Trump and his own role in the administration, made a public statement last week reaffirming his support for the President after news reports spoke of acrimony between the two men -- principally, that Tillerson had questioned Trump's intelligence, calling him a \\"moron,\\" in front of other top officials.      Tillerson's statement of support for Trump prompted the President to say his secretary of state had refuted the story about the insult. Trump later told reporters inside a Las Vegas hospital, where he was visiting the victims of last Sunday's mass shooting, that he has \\"total confidence\\" in Tillerson and said reports that the secretary of state called him a moron were \\"fake news\\" and \\"totally made up.\\" ||||| Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Sunday called the White House “an adult day care center” after President Trump attacked him in a morning Twitter tirade.      Setting off an extraordinary squabble between two leaders of the same party, Trump alleged in a trio of tweets that Corker “begged” him for his endorsement, did not receive it and decided to retire because he “didn't have the guts” to run for reelection next year.      In response, Corker (Tenn.) tweeted, “It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”      It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017      By alienating Corker, Trump risks further endangering his legislative agenda. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Corker would be a leading voice on Capitol Hill determining the future of the Iran nuclear deal, should Trump “decertify” the agreement and punt to Congress a decision about whether to restore sanctions against Iran.      Corker also sits on the Senate Budget Committee and looks to play a key role in the upcoming debate over taxes. The senator already has expressed some concerns with the Trump administration's proposal on tax cuts.      In an apparent response to Corker's \\"adult day care center\\" charge, Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon that Corker was an ineffective senator and could not \\"get the job done.\\"      \\"Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it,\\" Trump wrote. \\"We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\\"      Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017      Trump's public lashing of Corker comes after the senator made headlines last week when he starkly suggested that the national security team provides the president with badly needed adult supervision. In a remarkable statement, Corker told reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.”      Trump, who has little tolerance for public criticism and prides himself on counterpunching those who cross him, fired off a trio of tweets Sunday morning attacking Corker, who announced last month that he plans to retire and not seek reelection in 2018.      Trump tweeted, “Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without... ..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017      Todd Womack, Corker's chief of staff, disputed Trump's claims, saying that the president repeatedly has offered to support Corker, and as recently as last week asked the senator to change his mind and run for reelection.      “The president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” Womack said in a statement.      Corker was a prominent supporter of Trump's 2016 campaign, and Trump considered him a potential running mate and secretary of state. Corker was one of only a few senators to develop a personal relationship with Trump and his family, but tensions between the two men flared over the summer.      In August, Corker criticized Trump's handling of the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, saying, “The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”      Then, as now, Corker became a subject of Trump's ire. In response to the senator's “stability” and “competence” comments, Trump tweeted, “Tennessee not happy!”      Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017      Corker is not the only Republican senator to come under attack from the presidential bully pulpit. In recent months, Trump has gone after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) with cutting and sometimes personal insults.      Republican lawmakers have voiced exasperation that Trump is spending his time attacking senators he will need as allies if he hopes to sign any signature legislation, such as the tax-cut plan his administration has been trumpeting.      Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Sunday that he enjoys working with Corker and that the senator feels free to speak his mind now that he is not seeking reelection.      “I think it’s going to be fun to work with him, especially now that he’s announced that he’s not running for reelection, because I think it sort of unleashes him to do whatever and say whatever he wants to say,” Mulvaney said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.”      1 of 81 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Scenes from Trump?s second six months in office View Photos A look at the second half, so far, of the president?s first year in the White House.

A fire broke out after the tunnel caved in on Sunday, and a number of survivors fled to safety on foot. The usually busy tunnel remains closed, as police are investigating potential negligence. There will be serious questions about how a major tunnel on one of Japan's most important traffic arteries could have failed so catastrophically, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Tokyo reports. The private company that runs the highway has said the tunnel was given a major inspection just two months ago and was given a clean bill of health, our correspondent adds. In pictures: Japan tunnel collapse Emergency workers said that five bodies were recovered from a van early on Monday. They were identified as three men and two women, all in their twenties and from Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. Another woman, aged 28, who had been in the vehicle survived. Three bodies were found in a car and another body in a lorry. The driver of the lorry had reportedly telephoned for help from inside the 4.3km (2.7 miles) twin-bore tunnel - one of the longest in Japan. Part of the tunnel collapsed at 08:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday). Thick black smoke was seen billowing from the tunnel, hampering rescue efforts. Pictures from closed circuit TV cameras inside the tunnel later showed a section of up to 100m (328ft) that had caved in on the Tokyo-bound lanes on the Chuo Expressway in Yamanashi prefecture. A reporter for public broadcaster NHK described driving through the tunnel as it began to collapse, seeing other cars trapped and on fire. His car was badly damaged, he said. Another survivor told the broadcaster that he saw \\"a concrete part of the ceiling fall off all of a sudden when I was driving inside. I saw a fire coming from a crushed car\\". Survivor Tomohiro Suzuki said: \\"A part of the ceiling, just as wide as the road, had collapsed straight down and broken in the middle into a V-shape.\\" He and his family walked for an hour to get out, with the smoke worsening. \\"I heard after a while on the public address system that a fire had occurred inside the tunnel and the sprinkler system was going to be activated,\\" he told Jiji Press. \\"I kept wondering when the fire would spread and catch us,\\" Mr Suzuki said. Japan is prone to large earthquakes, but none was reported in the area at the time.

Information:  - Southern England, or the South of England, also known as the South, refers roughly to the southern counties of England. The extent of this area can take a number of different interpretations depending on the context, including geographical, cultural, political and economic.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - York Castle in the city of York, England, is a fortified complex comprising, over the last nine centuries, a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings on the south side of the River Foss. The now-ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford's Tower. Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of York, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929.  - In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers to a geographical area with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture). These are often associated with an ethnolinguistic group and the territory it inhabits. Specific cultures often do not limit their geographic coverage to the borders of a nation state, or to smaller subdivisions of a state. Cultural \\"spheres of influence\\" may also overlap or form concentric structures of macrocultures encompassing smaller local cultures. Different boundaries may also be drawn depending on the particular aspect of interest, such as religion and folklore vs. dress and architecture vs. language.  - Duke of Northumberland is a noble title that has been created three times in English and British history, twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of Great Britain. The current holder of this title is Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland.  - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.  - Joscelin of Louvain, also spelled Jocelin de Louvain and Jocelyn of Leuven, (11211180) was a nobleman from the Duchy of Brabant who settled in England having married an English heiress. Through his youngest son, the House of Percy  as the Earls and later the Dukes of Northumberlandbecame the most powerful family in Northern England. He was brother-in-law to King Henry I, whose second wife was Joscelin's half sister Adeliza of Louvain.  - The title of Earl of Northumberland was created several times in the Peerage of England and of Great Britain, succeeding the title Earl of Northumbria. Its most famous holders were the House of Percy (\\"alias\\" Perci), who were the most powerful noble family in Northern England for much of the Middle Ages. The heirs of the Percys, via a female line, were ultimately made Duke of Northumberland in 1766.  - The House of Neville ( also the House of Nevill ) is a noble house of early medieval origin , which was a leading force in English politics in the later Middle Ages . The family became one of the two major powers in northern England along with the House of Percy and played a central role in the Wars of the Roses .  - The Midlands is a cultural and geographic area roughly spanning central England that broadly corresponds to the early medieval Kingdom of Mercia. It borders South East England, South West England, North West England, Yorkshire and Humber, East of England and Wales. Its largest city is Birmingham, and it was an important location for the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. The greater part of the area is formed of two English statistical regions: the West Midlands and East Midlands.  - Percy-en-Auge is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It is the ancestral home of the House of Percy.  - The River Trent is the third-longest river in the United Kingdom. Its source is in Staffordshire on the southern edge of Biddulph Moor. It flows through and drains most of the northern Midlands around and east of Birmingham. The river is known for dramatic flooding after storms and spring snowmelt, which in past times often caused the river to change course.  - The House of Percy (old French Perci) were the most powerful noble family in northern England for much of the Middle Ages, having descended from William de Percy (d.1096), a Norman who crossed over to England after William the Conqueror in early December 1067, was created 1st feudal baron of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, and was rebuilding York Castle in 1070. The name derives from the manor of Percy-en-Auge in Normandy, the home of the family at the time of the Norman Conquest. Members have held the titles of Earl of Northumberland or Duke of Northumberland to this day, in addition to Baron Percy and other titles. The Percy surname twice died out in the male line but was re-adopted by the husband of a Percy heiress and by their descendants. In the 12th century, the original Percy line was represented by Agnes de Percy, whose son by her husband Joscelin of Louvain adopted the surname Percy. Again in the 18th century, the heiress Elizabeth Seymour married Sir Hugh Smithson, who adopted the surname Percy and was created Duke of Northumberland.  - William I (Old Norman: \\"Williame I\\" c. 1028  9 September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard, was the first Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as Duke William II) from 1035 onward. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son.  - The title Baron Percy has been created several times in the Peerage of England. The first, soon after 1066, a feudal barony rather than a barony by writ, which continued in parallel with the later baronies by writ, until the abolition of feudal tenure by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The second, created by writ in 1299, became extinct in 1517. The third, created by writ in 1557, became extinct in 1670. The present creation was in 1722, by writ of summons.

Write an article with the title: \\"Rescue crews in Turkey keep searching for earthquake survivors\\"","output":"Title: Rescue Crews in Turkey Keep Searching for Earthquake Survivors Introduction In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck the western part of Turkey, rescue crews remain relentless in their search for survivors. The brave men and women, including those from both national and international teams, work collectively to bring comfort and hope to those affected by this natural disaster. This article explores the efforts put forth by these rescue teams, their methods, and the challenges they have faced while conducting their life-saving missions. Turkey's Earthquake: A Snapshot On [insert date], a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 shook western Turkey, particularly the province of Izmir and its surroundings, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The tremor was also felt in neighboring areas, such as Greece and Bulgaria, where casualties have been reported as well. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Aegean Sea, near the island of Samos in Greece, which resulted in a small tsunami affecting the coastal regions of Turkey and Greece. Buildings collapsed, and many people found themselves trapped under the rubble, highlighting the need for immediate rescue and relief efforts. Rescue Efforts In the aftermath of the earthquake, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) mobilized its search and rescue teams which comprise of not only government personnel but also volunteers. Additionally, international assistance was provided by various countries, including search-and-rescue teams from Greece, France, and Germany. These rescue teams, armed with advanced equipment such as life detectors, thermal imaging cameras, and search dogs, have been working non-stop to search for trapped survivors, often facing numerous challenges such as unstable structures, aftershocks, and limited time. While tirelessly digging through the rubble, the teams have managed to save hundreds of lives so far, and they continue to operate around the clock in search of more survivors. Challenges and Limitations The rescue operations are not without difficulties, as crews face numerous challenges along the way. The recovery process has been slow and laborious, as manual lifting of debris is often the only option, given the hazards of heavy machinery usage in densely-populated, urban areas with narrow streets. Additionally, the uncertainty of the number of people still trapped under the rubble complicates the efforts, as some of these individuals had not been accounted for prior to the earthquake, making it difficult to estimate potential rescue successes. Furthermore, with each passing hour, the chances of finding survivors diminish, as individuals caught under the debris face the risk of dehydration, hypothermia, or life-threatening injuries. Rescue crews also face the constant fear of aftershocks, which pose a threat to both the rescuers and those still trapped under the remains of collapsed buildings. Strength Through National and International Cooperation In these trying times, rescue operations not only symbolize a nation's commitment to its people but also showcase the value of international cooperation. With countries offering support and resources, there exists a strong sense of unity in this joint human endeavor to save lives and help people rebuild their lives. Though the earthquake has caused much devastation, it has also revealed the strength of humanity, as rescue crews tirelessly search for every last survivor. Particularly impressive is the fact that long-time political rivals, Turkey and Greece, have set aside their differences to focus on saving lives and providing aid to those in need. Conclusion Rescue efforts in the wake of Turkey's devastating earthquake serve as a powerful reminder of both the fragility and resilience of human life. Courageous rescue crews persevere under extreme conditions to save lives trapped in the rubble, while both local and international communities come together to offer support during these difficult times. Amid the chaos and destruction, hope remains as these dedicated individuals work tirelessly in the search for survivors, highlighting the power of unity and compassion in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that \\"I’ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust.\\"Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages.  Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video.  Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.  The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery.  And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.  Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in \\"stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork\\".  DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.

Article: Do you routinely prepare for trash day, sweep up when necessary, and pitch in toward a functional house? Many of these tasks may be considered part of your chores or expectations, but extra effort may be rewarded. Most parents like to see their kids attempting to be responsible with money, so ask them for a weekly or monthly allowance.  Negotiate a fair amount of money for the work that you do. Don't expect them to pay you /£20 for nothing. They may expect you to complete a few more household chores since they are paying you regularly. Think about how you will justify this allowance. Why do you need it? Why do you deserve it? Be prepared to give your parents good reasons if asked.  Common tasks that parents pay their children allowance to complete include: cleaning your room, emptying and loading the dishwasher, vacuuming, washing and folding laundry, and dusting. Look for opportunities for some extra cash in less common tasks. Think of any \\"someday\\" projects your parents have been talking about. Does Mom keep saying she needs to organize her tools in the garage? Does she always talk about reorganizing the pantry? Does Dad want his shop organized? Great! Come up with a plan to complete those tasks and present it to your parents along with your asking price. Present a reasonable plan with a realistic price and, after a little follow-through, you've got a payday. If you are trying to make money from your parents, don't hurt your chances by acting up. Arguing with your siblings, talking back to your parents, and breaking the rules may result in them taking away your allowance or punishing you by requiring you to do the work for no money. If your parents give you money for drinks, snacks, or sweets when you go to school or out with your friends, spend that money smartly. Instead of using all of it, maybe limit yourself to a can of coke or lemonade and put your other money away for later. That way you can still enjoy yourself, but save a little for later. If your parents send you into a store to pick up a few items, ask them if you can have the change. If they expect the money back, ask them can you keep the coins. Pennies, pounds and other coins quickly add up. If you've already got a savings account, talk to your parents about moving your money into an account which gains interest - that is, one that grows your money. They might not know much about these accounts, and that's okay. Ask if they would go with you to a bank or credit union so you can all ask questions about ways to save and grow your money.

He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, \\"Ask him if he needs any help.\\" I was sure that he would say \\"yes\\", but I listened to the inner voice. \\"Do you need any help?\\" I asked. He answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements.

Maybe not for a bus fare or for a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only for a bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you have achieved, you need help, too.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: To calculate your payment amount you will need to know the interest rate, the principal amount and how long you will be making payments.  Interest rate. The rate of your simple interest payment plan will most likely be communicated with a number in percentage form. This percentage reflects the amount of money extra you will be paying given a certain amount of time. Usually the rate is annual - for example if your rate is 15%, the extra amount will be 15% of the principal for every year that you have an outstanding balance. Principal amount. This amount reflects your outstanding balance. For instance, if you bought a computer that costs 2,000 and paid 1000 upfront, you would then have a principal amount of 1,000 left to pay. Time period of payment plan. This is the amount of time between your first and last payment. The longer the period is, the higher the total amount you paid for your purchase will be. . You need to find out much extra is going to be added to your outstanding balance.  Identify your your variables. What is the rate, the principal and time period of your payment plan? Be sure to convert your rate into a decimal amount. To do this you need to divide the number in the percentage by 100. For example, if your rate is 15%, divide 15 by 100 - you will get .15, the rate in decimal form. Consider the period of your payment plan versus the period specified by your interest rate. Does the period of your payment plan fit evenly into the period specified by the rate? If not, you will need to divide your interest rate before you do any further calculation with it. Imagine the case where you will only be making payments for 7 months but the rate is given per annum. You will probably need to divide the annual interest rate by 12 in order to generate a monthly interest rate. Multiply your rate in decimal form by the principal (rate x principal). This tells you how much interest will accrue per period. For example, if the principal is 1000 and the annual interest rate is 15% (.15), then you will be paying 150 per year in interest. If the principal is 1000 and your monthly rate is 3% (.03), then you will have to paying 30 per month in interest. Multiply the amount of interest per period by the number of time periods you expect it will take you to complete your payment (interest accrued per period x periods). This will give you your total accrued interest. Say you know that you'll be paying 150 per year in interest and you will be paying off your purchase for 3 years – by multiplying these numbers (150 x 3) you would find that your total accrued interest is 450. Add your total accrued interest to your principal amount (interest + principle). If you found that your total accrued interest is 450 and the corresponding principal amount is 1000, by adding these two figures you'll find that the total cost of your purchase is 1450. Consider how often you will be making your payment compared with the period in which you are accruing interest. Say the period in which you accrue interest is 3 years - if you are making monthly payments, there will be 36 of them; if you are making semiannual payments you will be 6 payments. Divide the total cost of your purchase by the amount of payments you will make.","output":"The article teaches how to calculate your payment amount by considering the interest rate, principal amount, and time period for a payment plan, and then adding the total accrued interest to the principal amount to find the total cost of your purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For handsome men,the extra kicks are more likely to come from economic benefits,like increased wages, while women are more likely to find joy just looking in the mirror. \\"Women feel that beauty is naturally important,\\" says Daniel Hamermesh,a University of Texas at Austin labor economist and the study's lead author. \\"They just feel bad if they're ugly.\\" Hamermesh is the acknowledged father of pulchronomics, or the economic study of beauty. It can be a dangerous job. He once made angry an audience of young Mormon  women, many of whom wished to stay home with future children, by explaining that homemakers tend to be less attractive than their working-girl peers . \\"Since beautiful women tend to be paid more,they have more motivation to stay in the work force,\\" he says. The pursuit of good looks drives several huge industries--in 2010, Americans spent  845 million on face-lifts alone--but few economists focused on beauty's financial power until the mid-1990s,when Hamermesh and his colleague, Jeff Biddle of Michigan State University, became the first scholars to track the effect of appearance on earnings potential for a large sample  of adults. Like many other desirable commodities , \\"beauty is rare,\\"  Hamermesh says, \\"and that rareness commands a price.\\" A handsome man is estimated to make 13 percent more during his career than a \\"looks-challenged\\" peer, according to calculations in Hamermesh's recent book, Beauty Pays. Interestingly, the net benefit is slightly less for pretty women, who may make up the difference by trading on their looks to marry men with higher earning potential. And some studies have shown that attractive people are more likely to be hired in a recession . Hamermesh argues that \\"there's not much we can do to improve our pulchritude \\". There are even studies suggesting that for every dollar spent on cosmetic  products,only 4 cents returns as salary--making lipstick a truly awful investment.  _ . One...

Write a title for this article: Forty-eight hours before his roster has to be cut to 75 players and just six days before the cut to the final 53-man roster, Jim Tomsula’s voice betrayed some of the pressures he’s facing. In a conference call Sunday afternoon, the 49ers’ head coach said he had just left a meeting in which the makeup of the offensive line was discussed. That unit was a glaring concern in the 49ers’ third preseason game Saturday in Denver. “We’re in the middle of that now,” Tomsula said, declining to comment on specifics because the players were off until Monday. On defense, linebacker NaVorro Bowman’s performance was cause for great optimism, but the team will be without Ahmad Brooks for the foreseeable future. Brooks, who is facing misdemeanor sexual-battery charges, was sent home from Colorado last week and will not practice with the team. “That’s day-to-day,” Tomsula said. “I have not been updated on that at all, so it’s exactly where it is.” Rookie Eli Harold started in Brooks’ place at outside linebacker, on the right side. Cory Lemonier started on the left side. Aaron Lynch did not play until the second half. “There’s a lot of competition going on there,” Tomsula said. “We did want to see them on the field together, against the best the opponent had out there.” Tomsula addressed the concerns of an entire continent, explaining that he thinks he knows what Jarryd Hayne can do returning punts. Hayne did not play in the first half Saturday. “I’m pretty confident in Jarryd’s ability to field the ball,” Tomsula said. “I’ve watched a ton of tape on this guy fielding a rugby ball. I’ve seen him field here at practice, in game situations. I feel very good about his abilities to perform with the ball in his hands on special teams. “The tackling part of it, the coverage part, I’ve seen a lot of improvement. I’ve seen what I need to see. It’s been a great evaluation.” Tomsula wanted to see the others who are in the return mix: Reggie Bush, Bruce Ellington and undrafted rookie DeAndrew White. Between now and Saturday, the final cutdown date, Tomsula has several decisions to make. The biggest involve the offensive line. There is no time frame for the return of Daniel Kilgore — “That’s going to be day-to-day,” Tomsula said — who started seven games at center last season before breaking his fibula. He is still recovering. The right side of the line is a question mark, and Colin Kaepernick faced constant pressure Saturday night. Tomsula indicated that Kaepernick had other options on the play on which he was sacked for a safety, but that the team is concerned about putting too much on video for regular-season opponents. Tomsula wouldn’t use fatigue or altitude as an excuse for the sloppiness of the game. The 49ers committed 13 penalties. “We don’t have any excuses,” he said. “We just have to fix it.” Ann Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels?  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

The disease is surging in the state, which has seen at least 381 cases this year, compared to just 27 last year; 95% of tested Houston mosquitoes were carrying the virus, the Los Angeles Times reports. \\"Texas is on track to have the worst year ever for West Nile virus,\\" an official says. The statewide death toll stands at 16. Officials blame a warm winter and wet spring; human and bird activity can also play a role, a CDC epidemiologist says. Though Texas' outbreak is the nation's worst, the state isn't the only one that's suffering: Louisiana and Mississippi have each seen 39 cases, including one death each, while Oklahoma has grappled with 22 cases. \\"We're probably hitting the peak nationally,\\" notes the epidemiologist. The virus can turn into West Nile fever or a range of other, more threatening diseases—though \\"less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness,\\" says a CDC rep, according to CNN. An expert points out that 90% of the victims she has studied took no precautions (like wearing bug spray).

Paragraph: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Q: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Please write a short summary for the following article: John Toner, UConn Basketball Architect, Dies at 91 By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSSEPT. 24, 2014 John Toner, an athletic director who helped turn the University of Connecticut into a basketball power, hiring its two best-known coaches, Jim Calhoun and Geno Auriemma, died on Tuesday at his home in Savannah, Ga. He was 91. His death was announced by the university. Toner, who arrived at UConn as the head football coach in 1966, was the athletic director from 1969 to 1987. He hired Auriemma as the women’s basketball coach in 1985 and Calhoun as the men’s coach in 1986. Auriemma and Calhoun have won a combined 12 N.C.A.A. championships at UConn. Auriemma’s team won a national title in 2014, as did the UConn men, coached by Kevin Ollie after Calhoun’s retirement. Auriemma and Calhoun praised Toner’s leadership in pushing the N.C.A.A. to include women’s varsity sports in 1981. “The growth of women’s sports in this country can be directly related to the work that John Toner did to help push forward the Title IX bill,” Auriemma said. Toner added women’s varsity sports at UConn in 1974 and took the university from the regional Yankee Conference to the larger Big East as a charter member in 1979. John Toner was born on May 4, 1923, in North Dighton, Mass., and grew up on Nantucket. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Boston University, where he was the starting quarterback in 1947 and 1948.

In this case, the star initially fuses hydrogen into helium in its core, as all main sequence stars do.

How does the sentence end? Neil has smaller feet than Joel. This is because","output":"Neil has smaller feet than Joel. This is because several factors determine the size and shape of an individual's feet, such as genetics, age, gender, and overall body proportions. In Neil and Joel's case, it appears that these factors have contributed differently to the development of their feet, resulting in Neil having smaller feet than his friend. Firstly, genetics plays a crucial role in determining the size and shape of a person's feet. Genes inherited from Neil and Joel's parents influence not only the length and width of their feet but also the arch type and toe configuration. It is likely that Neil inherited a combination of genes resulting in smaller feet compared to Joel, who inherited different genes influencing larger feet. Secondly, age significantly impacts foot size as people generally have smaller feet during their childhood and adolescence. The feet continue to grow and change throughout life, mainly due to the body's natural changes associated with aging. As we age, our arches may flatten, ligaments and tendons can lose elasticity, and the natural fatty padding on our soles may gradually thin. This can lead to a need for a larger or wider shoe size over time. If Neil is younger than Joel, this might explain the difference in their foot size. Gender differences can also account for variation in foot size. Males typically have larger feet than females due to their overall larger body size, hormonal influences, and differences in muscle mass and bone density. The average male shoe size is often larger than the average female shoe size. However, in Neil and Joel's case, they are both males so that gender differences might not be a significant factor. Another reason Neil has smaller feet than Joel could be the overall proportion of their body sizes. People with a smaller body frame might naturally have smaller feet than those with larger frames. Factors such as height, weight, and skeletal structure play a role in determining the overall body proportions, and consequently, the foot size. Neil's smaller feet could be a result of him having a smaller body frame compared to Joel. Lastly, lifestyle and cultural aspects might contribute to their difference in foot size as well. For instance, some traditional practices in certain cultures involve foot binding or wearing restrictive footwear like pointed shoes, influencing foot growth and shape over time. However, these practices are no longer widespread and are not likely the reason for Neil's smaller feet in this particular case. In summary, Neil has smaller feet than Joel primarily due to genetic factors and how they inherited different genes from their parents, along with differences in age, body proportions, and perhaps some other unidentified contributing factors. These factors work in combination to determine individual foot size and shape, leading to the observed difference between Neil and Joel's feet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions.

Meteora features a fusion of alternative metal, rap, and electronic sounds, and it includes popular singles such as \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" \\"Faint,\\" \\"Numb,\\" \\"From the Inside,\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" David Campbell contributed to Meteora as a string arranger, specifically on the song \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" The song is a standout track on the album, featuring Campbell's evocative string arrangement combined with the band's signature rap-rock fusion. The strings add an orchestral depth to the song, amplifying its emotional intensity. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" marked a stylistic departure from the band's previous work, showcasing their growth and willingness to experiment with different sounds and themes at that point in their career. In addition to his work with Beck and Linkin Park, David Campbell has worked with a wide range of artists and bands, including artists like Metallica, Adele, Radiohead, Beyonce, and Paul McCartney, among many others. His extensive career and experience in the music industry have made him a sought-after arranger and composer, proving his versatility and ability to adapt to various styles and genres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"There are also other types of museums in the city.\\" answer the question \\"What are bombillas?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"There are also other types of museums in the city.\\" does not answer the question \\"What are bombillas?\\". These two statements are unrelated, as one refers to the presence of various museums within a city, while the other is asking for a definition or description of \\"bombillas.\\" To properly answer the question about bombillas, we need to provide information about what they are and their use or significance. Bombillas are metal, wood, or bamboo straws with a filtered end used primarily for drinking the traditional South American beverage called mate. Mate is an infusion of the yerba mate plant, which is prepared by steeping dried yerba mate leaves in hot water. The bombilla serves as both a straw and a sieve, allowing the person consuming the mate to enjoy the liquid without consuming the leaves or other plant debris. Originating from the indigenous Guarani people in the regions that now comprise Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, the mate and bombilla have become symbols of cultural and social tradition. The communal consumption of mate fosters a sense of belonging and connectedness among participants, as they pass the shared gourd from one person to another in a clockwise manner. Bombillas can vary in size, material, and design, with the most common being made of metal (usually stainless steel or silver) due to their durability. Some bombillas may even boast intricate designs or patterns that add an artistic flair to the otherwise utilitarian item. The practical design of the bombilla has also led to its use in consuming other thick or pulpy beverages, such as fruit juices or smoothies, ensuring that solid particles are separated while sipping. In summary, the sentence about museums does not provide any information about bombillas. To answer the question about bombillas, it is essential to discuss their purpose, usage, cultural significance, and regional history. These drinking straws, employed predominantly for consuming mate, serve both practical and symbolic roles within South American culture, transcending their simple, utilitarian function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My group of friends consists mostly of smart, funny, and all-around rad people that I've shared a booth with at brillobox.  - They make a brilliant martini (sorry for the weird Britishism, but drinking their martinis somehow really does make me feel a little smarter and sassier) and at 5.50 they're a steal.  - The bartenders are friendly no matter how busy it gets. Go in there on a Friday or Saturday night and you won't find harder working drink slingers anywhere in the city. There's usually only two people manning the bar, but considering how packed it gets sometimes, the wait is pretty short.  - Their frites (6) are shoestring style and awesome; they come with curry ketchup, garlic aioli and chipotle mayo.   - The rest of their menu is well-priced pub-grub and the kitchen serves until 11.   - The upstairs dance floor and adjoining bar sometimes have a cover for live bands or djs, but it's generally reasonable and on occasion their dance party themes are pure magic (Sweet Lovely Death: A 1970's punk dj dance party, I'm lookin' at you).   - The atmosphere is relaxed. There are a handful of giant gawdy paintings that are truly ugly, but they're balanced out by bright-red wallpaper and cute dim lamps that create a mellow ambiance and make it look sort of like someone's fashionable Godmother died and left them all her stuff.  - Their beer selection is humongous.

Here is a breakdown of his victories at this prestigious tournament: 1. 2000 Open Championship: Held at the St. Andrews Links' Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, this victory is considered one of Tiger Woods' most dominant performances at a major championship. Woods won by eight strokes with a record-setting score of 19-under-par 269. This win made him the youngest player to complete a career Grand Slam, which includes victories at all four major championships (Masters, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship). 2. 2005 Open Championship: Five years after his first Open victory, Woods won his second Claret Jug at the Old Course at St. Andrews again. He finished with a score of 14-under-par 274, which was five strokes clear of his nearest competitor, Colin Montgomerie. This victory further solidified Woods' position as the premier golfer of his generation. 3. 2006 Open Championship: Tiger Woods triumphed for the third time at The Open Championship held at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. He finished with an 18-under-par score of 270, two strokes ahead of Chris DiMarco.

Write a title for this article: Spoilers for last night’s Homeland Season 3 finale follow: One of the first things you learn as a young TV viewer is that the screen has a magic power: the protagonist force field, which slows down fireballs and bends the arc of machine-gun bullets to ensure that major characters live until the day Nielsen kills them and everyone they know. The force field protected networks, who needed series to run until there was no more profit to be extracted from them, and fans, who could watch through their fingers knowing their favorites could never really die because their names were too high up in the credits. The mark of many “serious” dramas these days has been their willingness to power down that force field. As the likes of Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire killed off major stars with relish, it announced their daring, their commitment to drama over fandom, their willingness to go there. Now some TV fans and critics have become a kind of capital jury, deciding which characters “need” to die and when. Go on, Sons of Anarchy, kill off [name redacted]–if you’ve got the cojones! So did Nicholas Brody need to die? Well, he at least needed to go, lethally or not. He was a character in a CIA drama whose connection to any CIA operation had to be justified by more and more implausible twists over the last two seasons, as he went from war hero to terrorist suspect to congressman to assassin to wrongly framed terrorist to international fugitive to junkie to assassin again, but for the other team. (Homeland is a show that’s best enjoyed if you don’t stop to summarize its story turns in a sentence.) With Abu Nazir gone and Brody’s intel value gone with him, there was nothing to keep Brody relevant to the espionage storylines short of a implanting a computer chip in his brain. And while you can certainly find drama in a man trying to redeem himself to his estranged motel-housecleaner daughter, Homeland was not the show to do it (though it tried). It wasn’t so much that Brody needed to die as that, as a plausible character, he died at least a year ago, and probably two. Homeland wanted to be two things: a romance between two damaged soldiers and a fast-moving political-minded thriller that was honest about the implications of that damage. Its first season could have brought those two things together devastatingly; instead, it fell in love with its love story and, like Brody, couldn’t pull the trigger on its explosive vest. Season two began strong, and the searing showdown between Carrie and Brody in “Q&A” suggested the contrivances might all have been worth it. But as the show’s plot spiraled like a top losing its balance, it became clear that Brody’s survival was Homeland’s Monkey’s Paw, a case of wishing the dead back with, horrible results. Season three was a lower-stakes, more focused season, but more than that, in retrospect it was an attempt to call backsies on that early decision. It was not exactly more believable; Iran, for instance, is apparently a country that the CIA can infiltrate only dangerously under cover of darkness, or by booking a flight and checking into a nice hotel. But “The Star” gave Brody and Carrie closure, their run to the safehouse recalling their cabin getaway in the first season, and his redemption was fittingly dark, as he was hanged before a jeering crowd and denied a hero’s honor by his country. (Though the episode was fuzzy on just how Brody’s last act was received in the world: did the world “see him through [Carrie's] eyes” now, or was his heroism ignored?) Like American Idol contestants investing an awful ballad with emotion, Claire Danes and Damian Lewis managed to find the heart in the most jury-rigged scenarios. But even if there was–as Brody meta-acknowledged in the safehouse–nowhere left to go with the character, Homeland and Showtime deserve credit for doing what the story called for. Yeah, the writers had painted themselves into a corner, but Homeland had a big, loyal following of Brody-and-Carrie fans who would have been glad for it to keep painting that corner, even if it had to climb up the wall toward the ceiling. Those fans sent the show’s ratings ever higher even as it became a critics’ target, and there’s no guarantee they’ll come back for a show about–who? what? Carrie as Istanbul station chief? Saul Berenson, private intelligence contractor? Quinn, your new replacement Brody? Carrie’s baby-visitation arrangements with her in-laws the Brodys? (All this, of course, assumes that Brody isn’t just going to turn up next year like the unkillable “cockroach” we were told he was, with a scar on his neck and a debt to Javadi for arranging his fake execution.) The show could reboot itself now as the realpolitik espionage drama it occasionally was. It could have space now to explore some of the more interesting characters it ended up sidelining. (For instance Fara, the Muslim analyst whose loyalties were doubted both by her government and her family, had a promising storyline that just sort of evaporated this year.) But it will be a tough assignment. Those of us who long thought Brody was past his expiration date might decide the plot holes are just too big for fine performances and Saul’s majestic beard to cover up. And fans who bought in for the Brody-Carrie love story–the story that Homeland has spent three seasons tell us was the essential reason to watch–are likely looking for something else to do Sundays next fall. The title “The Star,” after all, doesn’t just refer to the emblem Carrie Sharpied onto the CIA wall at the end of the episode. It’s what you call a central character–the kind you’re not supposed to kill, under the rules that, as Homeland reminded us, now belong to a different time.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who does not say God is always the beloved: Sufi or Moses?\\"  Context: \\"Moses, in 7:143, comes the way of those who are in love, he asks for a vision but his desire is denied, he is made to suffer by being commanded to look at other than the Beloved while the mountain is able to see God. The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"From the context provided, it is clear that neither Sufi nor Moses reject the concept of God being always the beloved. Rather, both of these perspectives uphold this belief, albeit in subtly different manners. In the case of Moses, as per the recounting of the event in Quran 7:143, he yearned for a direct vision of God, a wish that underscores his deep love and desire for proximity to the divine. Despite the fact that this wish was not granted in the way he might have expected - his suffering upon being shown God's manifestation on the mountain was part of his assigned test - Moses' love for God remains evident. Thus, it is correct to say that, from Moses' point of view, God is unquestionably the beloved.  When analyzing Sufi philosophy, the concept of God as the beloved becomes even more profound. Sufism, a mystic tradition within Islam, is notably characterized by its emphasis on love and devotion to God, and its aspirational pursuit of a kind of psychic and spiritual intimacy with Him. Sufis see their journey of faith as a path of continuous longing, and their suffering in this path is perceived as a conduit to the realization of higher truths about God. Their ultimate aim is to attain a state of self-annihilation, where their egoistic self is wholly consumed in the love and consciousness of God - a state of 'fana' in Sufi terminology. This is exemplified in the context where Moses, in his state of annihilation from himself, was granted the unveiling of the divine truths.  Thus, both from the perspective of Moses and Sufism, God is always the beloved. Their experiences and expressions of this love might differ, given the dissimilarities between an individual's communion with God and a mystical tradition's overarching philosophy. However, the fundamental conviction tying them together is the unwavering love and deep-seated longing for God. Moses expresses this through his quest for a divine vision, and Sufis through their spiritual journey of longing and self-effacement. Therefore, it can be deduced from the context that neither Sufis nor Moses would claim that 'God is not always the beloved'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mariko Okada - Tokyo My year abroad in the United States was a fantastic experience. I'm not a shy person, and I was very comfortable speaking to everyone. So I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned many English songs and lots of interesting things about American culture. When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future. Carla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro I spent last year studying English in London. I'm from a small town, and London is a very big city. Sometimes I felt it was too big. There were so many people to talk to, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family, and I really missed my two cats. My roommate was always using our telephone, so I hardly had the chance for a nice long talk with my parents. I think it was a good experience for me, but I'm glad to be home! Alvin Chen - Hong Kong Studying in New Zealand was a fun experience for me, but it was also lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week----with lots of homework. I also kept a diary of my experience. I like to write, and I wrote two or three pages in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things about the culture. I'm really glad I went.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Limestone is located under the soil - Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time The answer is:","output":"The formation of caves and sinkholes through the erosion of limestone. Step-by-step justification: 1. Limestone is located under the soil: This sets the stage for the process, as limestone is a common sedimentary rock that can be dissolved by acidic solutions, such as carbonic acid. 2. Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth: Rainwater becomes slightly acidic by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming a weak carbonic acid solution. 3. The rain falls on the soil over the limestone: The rain, now containing carbonic acid, comes into contact with the soil above the limestone. 4. The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil: The acidic rainwater percolates through the soil, carrying the carbonic acid deeper toward the limestone. 5. The carbon dioxide turns into acid: This step is perhaps redundant, as the rain has already picked up carbon dioxide and formed carbonic acid in the previous steps. 6. The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil: The carbonic acid in the rainwater finally reaches the limestone layer, starting the dissolution process. 7. The acid dissolves the limestone: The carbonic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the limestone, gradually dissolving it and creating channels and voids within the rock. 8. Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time: As more acidic rainwater percolates through the soil and comes into contact with the limestone, the dissolution process continues, further eroding the rock. The final step in this process is the formation of caves, sinkholes, and other karst features as a result of the ongoing dissolution of the limestone by acidic rainwater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the (fictional) Los Angeles International Speedway in California.

Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, only to end up in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road. After being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer Sally Carrera requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave it in a single day, but it turns out to be shoddy and he is ordered to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map.

These individuals come together as a collective and unified group, advocating for their rights, workplace conditions, and fair compensation through unions. The principal reason for the unions constantly going on strike against the airlines for better salaries is to secure higher wages and improved work conditions for their members. Strikes are a form of industrial action used as a negotiation tactic to draw attention to the employees' demands and apply pressure on the airline companies. Although money is often the primary concern, several factors may contribute to the decision to go on strike. These factors include job security, benefits, promotion opportunities, scheduling, pension, and safety regulations. The consistent demand for better salaries and improved working conditions stems from various challenges faced by the airline industry, such as long working hours, irregular schedules, and the necessity for improved safety measures. Unions act as a voice for employees in labor negotiations with the airline companies, and strikes are seen as a last resort when negotiations fail or stall.

His widowed mother Elaine â who has led him to believe he is 12 years old, until William's older sister, Anita, tells their mother to tell the truth, his age is actually 11, from being placed into 1st grade at the age of 5, and skipped 5th grade.

In 1973, 15-year-old William, influenced by the rock albums left by his sister, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego. Rock journalist Lester Bangs, impressed with his writing, gives him a 35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert. He can't get backstage, but opening band Stillwater arrives, and after he flatters them with critical praise they bring him along. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him, partly because of William's new friendship with veteran groupie Penny Lane, though she prefers the term Band-Aid.

His interactions and relationships with the band members, particularly lead guitarist Russell Hammond and lead singer Jeff Bebe, whom William interviews, create an emotional rollercoaster, as he tries to balance professional objectivity with personal attachment. Furthermore, William's relationship with Penny Lane, a veteran groupie, contributes to his emotional growth. Despite their connection, Penny's true feelings are for Russell, thus complicating William's emotional state. Through this relationship, William learns about love, heartbreak, and the complexities of human emotions. Lastly, the pressure of writing a story for Rolling Stone, a prestigious magazine, and their belief that he is older than he is, as well as touring with Stillwater, adds to his emotional turmoil. William tries to maintain a balance between fulfilling his duties as a rock journalist and navigating the world of rock bands, friendships, love, and loyalty. Throughout the movie, William's experiences help him grow emotionally and provide valuable life lessons on dealing with challenging situations, relationships, and self-discovery. He learns the importance of remaining true to oneself while facing the ups and downs of life and navigating the complexities of human emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - An academy (Attic Greek: ; Koine Greek ) is an institution of secondary education, higher learning, research, or honorary membership.  - Attic Greek is the main Greek dialect that was spoken in ancient Attica, which includes Athens. Of the ancient dialects, it is the most similar to later Greek and is the standard form of the language that is studied in ancient-Greek language courses. Attic Greek is sometimes included in the Ionic dialect. Together, Attic and Ionic are the primary influences on Modern Greek.  - The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: \\"occidens\\" \\"sunset, West\\", as contrasted with Orient).  - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.  - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south.  - Byzantium (\\"Byzántion\\") was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople, and later still Istanbul. Byzantium was colonised by the Greeks from Megara in .  - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.  - Not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Elder Olympiodorus the Younger ( Greek :    ; c. 495 -- 570 ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher , astrologer and teacher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire , after Justinian 's Decree of 529 AD which closed Plato 's Academy in Athens and other pagan schools . Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria ( see Alexandrian School ) ; after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians , and was eventually moved to Constantinople .  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\",  \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70).  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

Information:  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\".  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician.   - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Marcin \`\` Novy '' Nowak ( born October 17 , 1975 ) is a Polish death metal musician known for his contribution to the bands Devilyn , Dies Irae , Nader Sadek , Thy Disease , Behemoth , Spinal Cord , Vader , Virgin Snatch and Crucified Mortals .

Pain can be both physical and emotional, and humans have a basic need to protect themselves from threats to their well-being.

Most people are familiar with the \\"trophy wife\\" stereotype that attractive women marry rich men, placing little importance on their other traits, including physical appearance, and that men look for pretty wives but don't care about their education or earnings.      New research, however, by University of Notre Dame Sociologist Elizabeth McClintock, shows the trophy wife stereotype is largely a myth fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers.      In \\"Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?\\" forthcoming in American Sociological Review, McClintock resolves the paradox between the trophy wife stereotype and the evidence that couples match on both physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status.      Using, for the first time, a nationally representative sample of young couples in which both partners were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness, McClintock was able to control for matching on attractiveness. She says prior research in this area has ignored two important factors.      \\"I find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women,\\" says McClintock, who specializes in inequality within romantic partnerships. \\"So, on average, high-status men do have better-looking wives, but this is because they themselves are considered better looking--perhaps because they are less likely to be overweight and more likely to afford braces, nice clothes and trips to the dermatologist, etc. Secondly, the strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity -- in education, race, religion and physical attractiveness.\\"      McClintock's research shows that there is not, in fact, a general tendency for women to trade beauty for money. That is not to say trophy wife marriages never happen, just that they are very rare.      \\"Donald Trump and his third wife Melania Knauss-Trump may very well exemplify the trophy wife stereotype,\\" McClintock says. \\"But, there are many examples of rich men who partner with successful women rather than 'buying' a supermodel wife.      The two men who founded Google (Larry Page and Sergey Brin) both married highly accomplished women--one has a PhD and the other is a wealthy entrepreneur.\\"      McClintock says the trophy wife stereotype is most often wrongly-applied among non- celebrities.      \\"I've heard doctors' wives referred to as trophy wives by observers who only notice her looks and his status and fail to realize that he is good-looking too and that she is also a successful professional--or was before she had kids and left her job,\\" McClintock says.      McClintock's research also indicates that, contrary to the trophy wife stereotype, social class barriers in the marriage market are relatively impermeable. Beautiful women are unlikely to leverage their looks to secure upward mobility by marriage.      # ||||| Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images      Trophy wives are a constant source of media and pop-culture fixation, and for understandable reasons: One, they tend to be beautiful, and two, they tend to be hitched to powerful, prominent men. Underlying the concept, of course, is a particularly old-fashioned notion of gender, of who seeks what in a relationship — but one which has been supported by certain empirical literature on relationship and marriage patterns. An important new study argues that this idea, and the research backing it, may be a myth that can be explained by biased misinterpretations of who is pairing with whom, and why.      The paper, written by Elizabeth Aura McClintock of Notre Dame and published in American Sociological Review, examined a big data set of heterosexual young-adult couples to better figure out how people choose a mate. McClintock discusses two mechanisms at work that potentially help explain the pairing process: matching and exchange. Matching is the notion that people “select a partner with similar characteristics” to themselves when it comes to education, attractiveness, and other characteristics. Exchange, on the other hand, is the idea of someone trading beauty or status to land a partner who has what they lack. The classic example of this is the trophy wife marrying a rich guy — she has beauty but lacks dough, while he has money but ain’t much to look at, so each partner is trading something for something.      McClintock’s argument is that past evidence for so-called “beauty-status exchange” — focusing, naturally, on attractive women settling down with rich men — is built on a misreading of the data. To make a long and somewhat wonky story short, socioeconomic status and beauty are correlated — richer people are more likely to be attractive, and vice-versa (this may be because attractive people are treated better and have an easier time gaining status, because rich people are healthier and can afford better beauty and grooming products, or some combination of these and other factors). This leads to problems when you realize that several of the past studies upon which the idea of beauty-status exchange is built only examined the women’s attractiveness and the men’s status. They ignored how the men looked and the education and/or the status levels of the women.      So let’s say you’re a researcher conducting one of these studies, and you notice that lots of high-status men marry beautiful women. Bam — beauty-status exchange. Only, slow down: What if these results can mostly be explained by matching rather than exchange? If people with high levels of status or beauty simply seek out similarly blessed people, that could explain why high-status men (who are more likely to be attractive) often end up with attractive women (who are more likely to be high status). Like is seeking like: It isn’t necessarily the case that much trading is going on. Without data on male attractiveness or female status, you’d miss these potential dynamics entirely, and instead chalk the patterns in the data up to a trophy-wife mechanism.      That’s the case McClintock makes, writing that her study is the first of its size and scope to look at both partners’ attractiveness and status. Sure enough, she finds scant evidence for beauty-status exchange — and what little evidence she does find is gender-symmetric, meaning men are just as likely to trade their beauty for a woman’s status as vice-versa, and seems restricted to shorter-term relationships.      It’s easy to find oneself flailing about in this methodological morass, but it’s worth understanding what’s going on here. McClintock’s study touches on some extremely important, fundamental questions about how we deal with gender in the social sciences, about how we potentially let our biases creep into the scientific (or “scientific”) method and therefore become legitimatized. No one study can conclusively disprove the idea of beauty-status exchange, but this one certainly puts a sizable dent in it, and it offers a rather compelling-seeming reason as to how so many researchers could have come to believe this idea in the first place.      As McClintock puts it:      This article … demonstrates how the expectations researchers bring to a topic may bias their findings. Assuming that the importance of beauty and status is gendered may cause researchers to overlook men’s attractiveness and women’s socioeconomic resources and thus to misidentify matching as exchange.      Eli Finkel, a psychologist at Northwestern who studies relationships but who wasn’t involved in this study, expanded on this point in an email. “Scientists are humans, too, and we can be inadvertently blinded by their beliefs about how the world works,” he said. “The studies that only looked at men’s (but not women’s) income and only looked at women’s (but not men’s) attractiveness were problematic in that way, as was the peer review process that allowed flawed papers like that to be published. Fortunately, cases like that are the exception rather than the rule, and science tends to do a good job of ferretting them out. That’s what McClintock has done here.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"New research by University of Notre Dame Sociologist Elizabeth McClintock has shown that the \\"trophy wife\\" stereotype is largely a myth, fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers.

Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards   near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels   to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it.

A:","output":"Once Upon a Time is a popular television series that aired from 2011 to 2018. Created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, the show is a fantasy drama that intertwines well-known fairytales and their characters, placing them in the modern world of Storybrooke, Maine. The unique spin on classic fairy tales attracted a wide audience and garnered the show a dedicated fanbase. The series was primarily filmed in and around the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia, Canada. This region is known for its picturesque landscapes, lush forests, and diverse architecture, which beautifully complemented the magical realism of the Once Upon a Time universe. Several specific filming locations contributed to the iconic look and feel of the show. 1. Steveston Village, Richmond: One of the most recognizable filming locations, this charming and historic fishing village served as the backdrop for the fictional town of Storybrooke. Many of the show's iconic locales – such as Granny's Diner, Mr. Gold's Pawn Shop, and Storybrooke Town Hall – can be found in and around the village. The exteriors of these buildings were often shot in Steveston, while interiors were filmed in a studio in Burnaby. 2. Central Park, Burnaby: The beautiful Central Park in Burnaby provided the perfect setting for various scenes that took place in the enchanted forest. Its towering trees, meandering pathways, and serene ponds served as an idyllic backdrop for many of the characters' adventures in the magical realm. 3. Lynn Canyon Park, North Vancouver: Another popular filming location, Lynn Canyon Park, provided the dense, lush forest that is often portrayed in fairy tale settings. The park's suspension bridge, waterfalls, and hiking trails added mystique and grandeur to many scenes throughout the series. 4. Roberts Creek, Sunshine Coast: This tranquil and picturesque waterfront community served as a shooting location for the scenic coastal shots in the show. The area's rugged natural beauty and quiet atmosphere allowed for a seamless blend of reality and fantasy. 5. Vancouver Studios and Bridge Studios, Burnaby: Interiors and soundstage work for the show were primarily done at the two main studios in Burnaby. These locations allowed the production team to create elaborate settings and special effects for the magical worlds that could not be filmed on location. Apart from these primary locations, several other places in the Greater Vancouver area and British Columbia served as the filming sites for specific scenes and episodes. These additional locations include Whytecliff Park, Grouse Mountain, the University of British Columbia, and New Westminster. The diverse, captivating, and beautiful landscapes of British Columbia provided an ideal setting for bringing the world of Once Upon a Time to life. As a result, the show's unforgettable blend of reality and fairytale enchantment has left an indelible mark on audiences worldwide."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the background: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen .

These tasks require careful thought, evaluation, and collaboration, which in turn implies substantial work being conducted by these committees. Furthermore, the context uses the phrase \\"enormous amount of work\\" to describe the efforts of committee members. This statement counters the hypothesis that committees do very little work. Instead, it supports the notion that committees are actively engaged in handling complex issues and are putting in considerable work to find solutions and make improvements in the mentioned areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT:  *unacceptable.  *acceptable....I think the answer is","output":"*unacceptable. A linguist would rate this sentence to be unacceptable linguistically, due to the ambiguity and improper use of prepositions, which make the meaning unclear. Let's break down the issues with the sentence to understand why it is considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The sentence is ambiguous, as it isn't clear whether Cheryl is the one standing while passing the books or if she is making the books stand in a specific order. In either case, the word \\"stand\\" is likely an inappropriate choice of verb to convey the intended action. 2. Improper prepositions: The preposition \\"from\\" is used here to indicate the relationship between Edna and the books. However, it is unclear as to whether this means that the books belong(ed) to Edna, or if Edna previously had possession of the books. If the intention is to indicate that Cheryl is giving the books to Sarah, then a more appropriate preposition would be \\"to\\" (e.g., \\"Cheryl passed the books to Sarah\\"). If the intention is to communicate that the action of standing the books is being done in order to create a specific arrangement, then we might see a sentence like \\"Cheryl stood the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" To revise this sentence and make it linguistically acceptable, we should first clarify its intended meaning. If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl passing the books from Edna to Sarah, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl passed the books from Edna to Sarah.\\" If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl arranging the books in a specific order, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl arranged the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" In either case, by rephrasing the sentence to better clarify the intended meaning and by using appropriate verb and preposition choices, we can create a sentence that a linguist would rate as acceptable linguistically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

In 1650, it was incorporated as a town under its original Indian name, Mattabeseck. It received its present name in 1653. Middletown was included within Hartford County upon its creation on May 10, 1666. In 1784, the central settlement was incorporated as a city distinct from the town. Both were included within newly formed Middlesex County in May 1785. In 1923, the City of Middletown was consolidated with the Town, making the city limits of the city quite extensive.   - The Chicago metropolitan area, or Chicagoland, is the metropolitan area associated with the city of Chicago, Illinois, and its suburbs. With an estimated population of 9.4 million people, it is the third largest metropolitan area in the United States. Chicagoland is the area that is closely linked to the city through geographic, social, economic, and cultural ties.  - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America.

It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations.

Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - Charles Sumner \`\` Chuck '' Stone , Jr. ( July 21 , 1924 -- April 6 , 2014 ) was a Tuskegee Airman , an American newspaper editor , columnist , professor of journalism , and author .

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement.

Given the question: If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases.  When there is more fluid in a tube the pressure in the tube increases or decreases? The answer is:","output":"The answer is: the pressure in the tube increases. Step-by-step logic: 1. Initially, we establish the fact that if blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. This implies a direct correlation between volume and pressure. 2. Applying this concept to the tube scenario, we would assume that the fluid in the tube represents the 'blood volume' in the initial statement, and the pressure in the tube stands for 'blood pressure'. 3. Therefore, going by the first statement, if the volume (in this case, the amount of fluid in the tube) increases, the pressure (in this case, the pressure in the tube) should also increase.  4. Therefore, the answer is that when there is more fluid in a tube, the pressure in the tube increases. \\t This is a basic idea common in areas such as fluid dynamics and health sciences, and it is partially rooted in Boyle's law from physics which states that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when temperature is held constant.

The sentence mentions three children playing with a volleyball and one adult observing them. So, there are four people in total. Step 2: Identify the location. The sentence states that the children are playing in shallow water, which indicates that they are by a body of water, such as a beach, lake, or river. Step 3: Determine if outdoors. Since the children are playing in shallow water and the adult is observing them, it is reasonable to assume that they are outdoors. It is unlikely for such activities to be held indoors.

However, it's important to note that the sentences are independent of each other and could represent different contexts or situations. In such a case, it's possible that both sentences are true within their respective contexts, but contradict each other when taken together. In conclusion, if we accept the first sentence to be true, then we must consider the second sentence to be false, given that they are in the same context. If they refer to different situations, then it's possible for both sentences to be true within their respective contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have shopped at this store for 25 years - jewelry, hats, children's gifts, Dia de Los Muertos items, glass wear, serapes and baskets for parties, and putting together Southwest food baskets for Holiday gifts every year. I have brought visiting family members here for everything from t-shirts to expensive jewelry items. The staff is helpful and friendly. The owner, \\"Hong\\", however - is not. She has a major attitude and has been rude and insulting on more than one occasion. I have had her follow me around like a suspected shoplifter when needing to try on a \\"Double D Ranchwear\\" t-shirt. It isn't my fault the only dressing room is in another area of the store, and \\"Lucita\\" already knew who I was/what I was trying on. Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present.  Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item.  Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case.  My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise,  so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family.  Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists. (Native Americans will usually identify their jewelry by the terms \\"Native American\\", \\"Zuni\\", \\"Navajo,\\" etc - not \\"Indian Made.\\") Further, a majority of her earrings - particularly the Repousse- can be found on eBay.....identical product - 60% less. If one purchases here, I would definitely ask for proof of authenticity. (and they do have some real works of art, but their inventory is a mix).  There's another issue: pricing. She clearly counts on the naive \\"one-purchase tourists\\" as her priority clients, because she has clothing hanging in her (unbelievably disorganized) clothing area that is nearly 3 years old (2012 Double D Ranchwear t-shirt, \\"The Wild Ones\\" for example).  So, from a local who shopped often at this store: I've decided that I can find any of these items elsewhere at any number of businesses that value my patronage. And my sincere apologies to the friendly and helpful staff that have to work under her. It's taken me a long time to write this review, and I kept going back and just avoiding her. In that time, I've discovered her attitude is already widely known around town. Choose the sentiment of this review? Available options: i. negative. ii. positive.","output":"i. negative. This review is decidedly negative. While at first it seems like it might be positive because the writer describes shopping at the store for many years and highlights some of the products they've bought, it quickly descends into a litany of complaints. The reviewer has major issues with the owner's demeanour and the way she interacts with customers, feeling like she was treated like a suspect and insulted, and criticizes the quality and authenticity of some items. The reviewer also accuses the owner of preying on naive tourists and keeping old stock, while also treating her workers poorly. They even state they've decided to take their business elsewhere where it'll be valued, which indicates dissatisfaction with the overall service at the store. The mention of friendly and helpful staff isn't enough to tilt the overall sentiment of the review towards positive. This is because the positive remarks are not only few, but they are also vastly outweighed by the multiple negative statements about the owner's behaviour, identification authenticity of products, pricing methods, and shop organization.

The answer to the question: What are the two names of the work that was well received in Gothenburg in 1860? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ?

To do this, you want to get rid of the -42 on the right side of the equation. Since it's a subtraction, you should add 42 to both sides of the equation to maintain the equality: -72 + 42 = 6*p - 42 + 42 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. -72 + 42 = -30, and -42 + 42 equals 0, so the equation becomes: -30 = 6*p Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, you need to isolate it by eliminating the coefficient, which is 6 in this case. Since 6 is being multiplied by p, you should divide both sides of the equation by 6: -30 / 6 = 6*p / 6 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. -30 / 6 = -5, and 6*p / 6 equals p, so the equation becomes: -5 = p Now you have found the value of p: p = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, it doesn’t look like it’s going to stop anytime soon!      The Biebs might seem like he's reacting to his devastating teenage heartbreak due to his wrecked romance with Selena Gomez, but this oddball behavior might have been in him all along.      According to sources, the only reason we haven’t seen the shirtless, Twitter complaining, late concert giving, sad birthday boy side before is because Selenita kept that shizz in check!      A source revealed his team needed Selena to make the magic that is Justin happen:      “They’d get her to convince him to do things he needed to do. He’d listen to her.”      The power of women!

But we should have realized the quickest way to get a teenage boy to do something is to tell him not to do it. That’s why it doesn’t surprise us that the Biebs has been all about this look lately, wearing the questionable style nonstop over the past two weeks.            He’s strutted around in them while shopping, making appearances, out at a club — and it even appears that a pair of tight-at-the-calves, loose-at-the-crotch white pants are part of the singer’s official tour uniform. (He’s worn them to all his concerts in the U.K. so far.)      And while Bieber is loyal to this one silhouette, he’s not picky about the color, print or style, sporting a blue canvas pair one day, a purple cheetah pair the next, then continuing the streak with a leather design he’s clearly quite taken with.      The more he wears the pants, the more confused we become. Bieber can’t possibly like the way the pants look, right? So he must be putting them on for some other reason. Here are some explanations we came up with:      •One of the last outfits Selena Gomez saw him in before the two split included a pair of these perplexing pants. This is his way of reminding her that despite all the stories, he’s still the same guy she used to be in love with.      •Being the fashion-forward dude that he is, he’s noticed that a skinnier leg is en vogue with men, but the allover supertight style isn’t compatible with his dance moves. So he had to find a type of pant that combined flexibility with fashion. Et voilá: the drop-crotch pant.      •He’s trying to become a spokesperson for the Association of People With Long Torsos and Short Legs.      Tell us: What do you think of Justin Bieber’s drop-crotch pants? Can you think of any other reasons why he might be wearing them?      –Zoë Ruderman      PHOTOS: VOTE ON MORE CONTROVERSIAL STAR STYLES HERE! ||||| Justin Bieber's current tour may be remembered for the debacle at London's O2, where weeping fans and furious parents endured a two-hour wait for his eventual appearance, but the defining image of his UK visit appeared in the press last week.

He's wearing driving gloves, of course; one is raised so that he can show two fingers to the photographer. More tellingly, behind him, ignored by a star preoccupied with having his photograph taken and kept at a safe distance by steel security gates, a pack of fans struggles to make contact. But while a dismissive attitude to fans is one thing, is there more to Bieber's troubles?      1.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a title for this article: The last two Republican presidential primary contests have followed the same script: A conservative candidate wins in Iowa, a relative moderate wins in New Hampshire, and the latter — with broader appeal and all of the establishment’s resources — outlasts the former in a protracted fight for the nomination. But so far this cycle, New Hampshire’s voters aren’t playing along. Donald Trump has led every poll in New Hampshire since June. Candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have struggled to get out of the single digits. The weakness of mainstream candidates in New Hampshire poses a big challenge for the party’s beleaguered establishment. If a candidate acceptable to the party can’t win New Hampshire or Iowa, the G.O.P. will face a bleak choice: undertake the daunting and expensive task of mounting a come-from-behind effort, or grudgingly acquiesce to a candidate it really doesn’t want, like Ted Cruz, but who may be better than someone it can never accept, like Mr. Trump. The extent of the weakness of the establishment in New Hampshire is a striking departure from recent contests. In the polling data that The Upshot has collected from the last three Republican primaries, no one other than Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and George W. Bush led even a single New Hampshire Republican poll in the year ahead of the contest. Not only did surging conservatives like Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich never lead, but they also didn’t usually come close. After all, this is a state where Jon Huntsman won 17 percent of the vote in 2012. The traditional strength of the establishment in New Hampshire is underpinned by all of the state’s demographic characteristics. Self-identified moderate voters made up approximately half of the electorate in the last three contests, according to exit polls, compared with about a third nationally. Evangelical Christians, who represent a majority of Republican voters in the South and Iowa, represent around one-fifth of G.O.P. voters in New Hampshire. How is Mr. Trump doing so well? He’s drawing on many moderate and secular voters who haven’t supported the anti-establishment but usually religious candidates who have fared well in Iowa. The same pattern emerges in national polls, which often show Mr. Trump faring best among self-described moderates. The strength of a populist candidate like Mr. Trump, who opposes free trade and immigration, isn’t without precedent in New Hampshire. In 1992, Pat Buchanan, another anti-trade and anti-immigration candidate, won 38 percent of the vote against the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush. Four years later, Mr. Buchanan actually won the state, narrowly beating the eventual nominee, Bob Dole. But the G.O.P. establishment then was not in anywhere near the danger it is now. This year, the “outsider” candidates, like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz and Ben Carson, possess as much organizational, financial and personal strength as the establishment candidates, or maybe more. This year’s schedule affords the party few opportunities to make a comeback: The contests after Iowa and New Hampshire — the Nevada caucuses, South Carolina and the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday — are all relatively favorable to conservatives. This year’s establishment candidates have shown far less strength, by any measure, than Mr. Dole or George H.W. Bush, who had the resources, name recognition and party backing to survive early setbacks. Mr. Trump is generally polling in the mid-20s in New Hampshire surveys. The large number of moderate, establishment-friendly candidates competing in New Hampshire might split the mainstream vote, preventing any one candidate from consolidating enough support to win. Many of these candidates have little chance to win the nomination, and some, like Chris Christie and John Kasich, barely register in national polls. But over all, Mr. Christie, Mr. Kasich, Jeb Bush, Mr. Rubio and Carly Fiorina combine for nearly 40 percent of the vote in New Hampshire polls, compared with around 25 percent in national surveys. There’s no guarantee that these voters, if their favorite exited, would coalesce behind any one of the other candidates in that group, but surely the establishment would be in a better position if there were not so many viable candidates competing for support in New Hampshire. Right now, there’s no good reason for any of them to leave. All of this creates a lot of danger for the party’s establishment. Its worst-case outcome is what the polls are already showing: a clear win for an unacceptable candidate, and the other candidates so evenly split and so far behind that the contest fails to clarify which candidate the establishment should coalesce behind. But there are other dangers, too, like the possibility that a relatively moderate candidate, like Mr. Kasich, could finish above mainstream candidates who are more acceptable to the establishment. The best case for the establishment, of course, would be if a mainstream candidate won the state and became the clear favorite of party elites in the process, but a strong second-place showing by an acceptable candidate would probably suffice. A strong second place for a candidate acceptable to the party would winnow the moderate wing of the field and position that candidate to ultimately consolidate party support and take a lead later in the primary season. There is a lot of time left until the February primary and just as much precedent for late movement. In 2008, Mr. McCain overcame a 15-point deficit over the final month of the race to defeat Mr. Romney by a comfortable margin. In the last cycle, Rick Santorum was polling in the single digits at this point in Iowa, but he ultimately surged in the final weeks to defeat Mr. Romney. There is enough time for Mr. Trump to fade, even if just by a little, allowing someone else to win. There is enough time for an establishment candidate to break out. There is even enough time for momentum and tactical voting to cause voters to consolidate behind a single candidate. So far, though, none of this has happened. Until it does, the establishment’s path to victory will look much longer than it has in any recent contest. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what causes causes thermal expansion?\\" is \\"kinetic energy\\", given that  molecules moving causes thermal expansion? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the right answer to the question \\"what causes thermal expansion?\\" can indeed be attributed to \\"kinetic energy\\" as one of the key factors, given that the movement of molecules plays a significant role in this phenomenon. However, to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of thermal expansion, it is important to delve deeper into the underlying concepts and mechanisms at work. Thermal expansion is the process by which matter (such as solids, liquids, or gases) expands or contracts when their temperature changes. When a substance is heated, its constituent particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) gain kinetic energy, which results in an increase in their average speed and motion. These particles have a natural tendency to vibrate, rotate, or move due to the intrinsic energy they possess. As the kinetic energy of these particles increases with temperature, they start to occupy more space due to the greater average distance between them, leading to an increase in the volume of the substance. In the case of solids, thermal expansion is mainly caused by the increase in vibrational motion of the constituent atoms or molecules. When heated, these particles vibrate more vigorously, causing the average distance between them to increase. In turn, this leads to the expansion of the solid's lattice structure, subsequently resulting in a macroscopic increase in size. For liquids, the mechanism of thermal expansion is similar, yet slightly different. As the molecules in a liquid gain kinetic energy upon heating, they move faster and spread out, overcoming some of the intermolecular forces that hold them together. This increased molecular motion leads to an increase in the average distance between the liquid's molecules, causing the liquid's volume to expand. Gases, on the other hand, exhibit a more noticeable thermal expansion compared to solids and liquids. Gas molecules, when heated, not only vibrate more intensely but also move at much higher speeds. This increased molecular motion overcomes the weak intermolecular forces acting on the gas particles, thereby causing the gas to expand considerably as the temperature increases. In conclusion, one can consider kinetic energy as an appropriate answer for the cause of thermal expansion, given that the increased motion of particles due to the increase in their kinetic energy leads to the observed expansion in the macroscopic scale. However, it is important to consider the details and underlying mechanisms at play, such as vibrational motion in solids and the overcoming of intermolecular forces in liquids and gases, to have a well-rounded understanding of thermal expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of us regret certain intimate encounters and some are infinitely more glorifying than others, but a squirrel might have some regrets of his own after he mounted a GoPro camera. The unlikely love match occurred as the camera filmed the lustful squirrel eating seeds and nuts. The video begins with the squirrel gingerly making his way up to the food which is laid out invitingly on some stones in front of the  camera. Dinner time: The squirrel gets closer and appears more confident as he begins to eat the seeds and nuts. As the squirrel begins eating he glances into the camera and he appears to be far more curious about the device. However, what happens next is both surprising and amusing. The frisky squirrel turns his back to the camera and moments later he runs behind it. The rustling of the squirrel can then be heard as he gets up close and personal with the GoPro camera which shakes violently during the intimate encounter. The squirrel looks into the camera and he appears to be far more curious about the device. While he is eating the second nut he turns his back to the camera moments before he runs behind the camera. The rustling and the jostling noises begin as the squirrel mounts the camera, which begins to shake. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article describes an amusing encounter between a squirrel and a GoPro camera that was left to record the animal eating seeds and nuts. In the video, the squirrel cautiously approaches the stones where the food is placed and starts eating. During this time, the squirrel becomes increasingly curious about the camera.

What happened to Greek, Roman & Norse gods?","output":"No, these two questions have different meanings and ask for distinct information on Greek, Roman, and Norse gods. Let's look at both questions separately: 1. What are the last names of Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is asking for the last names or surnames associated with deities from three different mythological pantheons: Greek, Roman, and Norse. However, it is important to clarify that gods and goddesses in ancient mythologies generally did not have last names like we do today. For context, here is a brief overview of some major gods and goddesses from each pantheon: Greek mythology: - Zeus: King of the gods and god of the sky, lightning, and thunder - Hera: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth - Poseidon: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Roman mythology: - Jupiter: King of the gods and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning - Juno: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, childbirth, and family - Neptune: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Norse mythology: - Odin: The All-Father, chief of the Aesir, and god of wisdom, war, and poetry - Thor: God of thunder, lightning, storms, and strength - Freyja: Goddess of love, beauty, fertility, and war In mythology, one might argue that gods and goddesses have epithets rather than last names. Epithets are descriptive phrases or terms given to deities to describe their attributes, actions, or roles within their mythology and religion. For example, Zeus is referred to as \\"Zeus Olympios\\" (Zeus of Olympus) or \\"Zeus Xenios\\" (Zeus of hospitality). These epithets provide a form of identification and characteristics, but they are not last names. 2. What happened to Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is seeking information about the historical and cultural development of these three mythological pantheons as well as their influence and transformation over time. Greek gods: The Greek gods were widely worshipped and followed by the ancient Greeks. As time passed and Christianity spread, the influence of Greek gods began to fade. During the Roman Empire, Greek gods were often incorporated into Roman culture and adopted new identities and characteristics. Ultimately, as Roman polytheism declined and Christianity gained prominence, worship and belief in Greek gods diminished further. Roman gods: Initially, the Romans had their gods and followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. As the Roman Empire expanded and came into contact with Greek civilization, they adopted many of the Greek deities, attributing Roman names and identities to them. The rise of Christianity and the eventual adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Emperor Constantine I in the early 4th century AD led to the decline of Roman polytheism. Norse gods: The Norse gods were integral to the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient Norse people. As various Northern European regions, such as Scandinavia and other regions inhabited by Germanic tribes, came into contact with Christianity, conversion began to take place. By the end of the Viking Age (around 11th century AD) and the continued spread of Christianity, Norse polytheism saw a decline, and worship and belief in Norse gods dissipated and became part of folklore, legends, and stories. In summary, while the two questions are related to Greek, Roman, and Norse deities, they are indeed asking for different information. The first question focuses on identifying the last names of these gods, whereas the second question seeks historical context on the evolution and decline of these mythological pantheons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived.  But I can use this background: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\"  What is an answer for this question: Which continent caused less tropical forest destruction?

Choices: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"The Invisible Man is a novel by H.G. Wells that is a standard part of the 12th CBSE English Literature syllabus. In order to get full marks on Invisible Man-related answers in your exam, it is crucial to prepare well by understanding the important questions and their corresponding answers, as well as learning how to structure your answers effectively. For the multiple-choice problem, the answer would be [b]. yes, as both questions aim to prepare a student to achieve the maximum marks in their CBSE English exam. Here are some of the essential questions and answers from The Invisible Man that may help you in your preparation: 1. Q: Describe the central theme of The Invisible Man.    A: The central theme of The Invisible Man explores the consequences of unchecked scientific ambition and the dangers of attempting to play God. The character of Griffin, a brilliant scientist, discovers a method to become invisible. However, his inability to reverse the process and the resultant isolation, coupled with power and lack of moral responsibility, results in a tragic and destructive downward spiral. 2. Q: Explain the significance of the title 'The Invisible Man.'    A: The title 'The Invisible Man' refers to the protagonist Griffin, who becomes invisible due to an experiment gone awry. The title symbolizes not only Griffin's physical invisibility but also the psychological and emotional invisibility he experiences as a result of his condition. It highlights the theme of isolation and alienation, underscoring the idea that invisible forces within our society and psyche can often have a powerful, unintended impact on our lives. 3. Q: Elaborate on the character of Dr. Kemp in The Invisible Man.    A: Dr. Kemp is a scientist and former acquaintance of Griffin. He is rational, level-headed, and empathetic. When Griffin seeks Kemp's help in executing his plans of terror, Kemp refuses and instead tries to apprehend Griffin. His character serves as a foil to Griffin, showing the reader how a responsible scientist should behave. Kemp embodies moral responsibility and the humanist perspective on scientific progress. 4. Q: Discuss the role of setting in The Invisible Man.    A: The setting of The Invisible Man, primarily taking place in a rural English village called Iping, plays a critical role in the novel. The remote, somewhat isolated location allows Griffin to conduct his experiments away from prying eyes while also allowing the villagers to witness strange phenomena without understanding the technology behind it. This setting emphasizes the theme of science versus superstition and highlights Griffin's transformation from a solely scientific pursuit into a much darker and menacing force. To write comprehensive answers to ensure full marks, consider following this structure: 1. Introduction: Begin with a brief introduction of the topic, presenting the context, theme, or character you will be discussing. 2. Body: Divide the body of your answer into clear, well-organized paragraphs. Provide textual evidence and examples to support your ideas. Analyze the significance of these examples and demonstrate how they relate to the overall theme or character development. 3. Conclusion: Sum up your main points and offer a final insight into how the aspect you have discussed contributes to the understanding of the novel as a whole. By studying the important questions, answers, and structuring your responses as per the suggested format, you will increase your chances of performing well and achieving full marks in the CBSE English exam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: WASHINGTON Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has hired high-profile Washington defense attorney Reid Weingarten, according to a government source, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank.      Blankfein, 56, is in his sixth year at the helm of the largest U.S. investment bank, which has spent two years fending off accusations of conflicts of interest and fraud.      The move to retain Weingarten comes as investigations of Goldman and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis continue.      The news spooked already jittery investors. Goldman shares fell sharply in the final minutes of regular trading after Reuters reporting the hiring, finishing down 4.7 percent at 106.51, their lowest level since March 2009.      They slipped further in after-hours trade to 105.45.      The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) in April released a scathing report that criticized Goldman for \\"exploiting\\" clients by unloading subprime loan exposure onto unsuspecting clients in 2006 and 2007, and concluded that its top executives misled Congress during testimony in 2010.      Goldman has said it disagreed with many of the report's conclusions, but took seriously the issues addressed. The Justice Department launched its investigation in late April.      On Monday, Goldman said: \\"As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department's inquiry into certain matters raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset.\\"      Blankfein has not been charged in any civil or criminal case.      \\"Why do you bring in someone like that?\\" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, about Weingarten. \\"It says one thing: that they're taking it seriously.\\"      Robert Hillman, law professor at the University of California at Davis, said the move showed that the CEO \\"has some concern over action that is likely to be taken, presumably by the Justice Department.\\" But he added, \\"It does not signify that he is guilty, or that any action is definitely going to be taken.\\"      Weingarten, whose past clients include a former Enron accounting officer, was in a federal court in New York on Monday for the sentencing of another client, Anthony Cuti, the former CEO of the Duane Reade chain of drugstores, who was convicted of accounting fraud last year. Cuti was sentenced to three years in prison and a 5 million fine.      Weingarten did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.      \\"This was the last thing that Goldman Sachs or any institutions in the sector needed,\\" said Peter Kenny, managing director of Knight Capital in Jersey City, NJ. \\"There is zero tolerance for risk or perceived risk right now.\\"      HIGH-PROFILE CLIENTS      A partner with Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Weingarten has represented a wide array of clients in criminal cases. They include former WorldCom Inc chief Bernard Ebbers, who was later convicted, and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey, who pleaded guilty in exchange for a 5 to 7-year prison term.      In May, his client, former GlaxoSmithKline lawyer Lauren Stevens, was acquitted of charges of lying and obstructing a probe into the company's marketing practices.      \\"I'm used to these monstrously difficult cases where everybody hates my clients,\\" Weingarten told AmericanLawyer.com in May, although he described Stevens as a \\"beloved figure.\\"      Controversy has continued to swirl around Goldman Sachs and Blankfein in the aftermath of the credit crisis in which Goldman was accused of favoring some clients over others, and of sometimes trading against the interest of clients.      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scored a 550 million settlement against the bank in a fraud lawsuit in July 2010, but other investigations continue.      In June, New York prosecutors subpoenaed the bank to explain its actions in the run-up to the financial crisis. In addition to the Justice Department, the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating.      It was not immediately clear what charges, if any, Blankfein could face personally.      One former federal prosecutor, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Blankfein may have hired outside counsel after receiving a request from investigators for documents or other information.      The Senate report raised questions about inconsistencies between testimony from Blankfein and other Goldman executives to Congress and emails unearthed in the Senate investigation. The subcommittee's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, has said the question of whether Blankfein and others committed perjury is up to the relevant federal agencies.      The former prosecutor cautioned that perjury cases were difficult to prove, adding that prosecutors would not bring charges unless they had a \\"rock solid case.\\"      Goldman earlier in August lowered its estimate for future legal costs to 2 billion from its 2.7 billion estimate three months earlier. It said it expects such costs to remain high for the foreseeable future.      (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Additional reporting by Carlyn Kolker, Andrew Longstreth and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn) ||||| Michael Stravato for The New York Times      Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News      Goldman Sachs’s actions during the financial crisis returned to haunt it with a fury on Monday afternoon.      In late trading, shares of Goldman tumbled nearly 5 percent, knocking 2.7 billion off the firm’s market value, after a report that the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten.      Goldman, when confirming the hiring, portrayed it as routine, given the several government investigations faced by the firm. But the sharp reaction in the stock price showed the fragile nerves of investors, who are worried that potential legal liability could damage the firm and its earnings power.      A spokesman for Goldman said executives at the firm were expected to be interviewed by the Justice Department. The agency is conducting an inquiry that stems from a 650-page report produced earlier this year by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. That report said that Goldman had misled clients about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities.      “As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the P.S.I. report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs said in a statement.      While investors apparently feared the worst on Monday, a person close to the matter said that Mr. Blankfein had not been subpoenaed and that no Goldman executive had received an individual subpoena. Goldman is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.      Still, Monday’s stock fall underscored just how vulnerable Goldman’s stock would continue to be until the Justice Department and other authorities finished their investigations.      “Until Goldman resolves its legal issues, the company and the stock are vulnerable to all sorts of perceptions, real or perceived,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities.      With about 20 minutes left in the trading day, Reuters, citing an unidentified government source, reported that Mr. Blankfein had hired Mr. Weingarten. Mr. Weingarten has defended Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and Mike Espy, a former agriculture secretary. Goldman’s stock price quickly tumbled, falling to its lowest level since March 2009. Its shares closed at 106.51.      The stock move also reflected the support Goldman shareholders had for Mr. Blankfein despite the problems the firm’s problems under his stewardship. At Goldman’s stakeholder meeting in May, shareholders voted 97 percent in favor of his leadership. Any suggestion that Mr. Blankfein’s legal woes were mounting, or that he might leave the firm, would be seen as a negative for the stock.      Goldman investors have been on a roller-coaster ride since April 2010, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of duping clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly created by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market’s collapse.      Since then, it has been dogged by investigations and speculation about investigations, all of which have taken its toll on stock. Goldman shares were trading near 180 a share before the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit. Goldman settled that suit a few months later, but its troubles were far from over.      This year came the Senate report, which led to a Justice Department inquiry. And in June, Goldman received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is also investigating Goldman’s role in the financial crisis.      Mr. Blankfein’s decision to hire his own lawyer is not unusual. Legal experts say that it is now common for a company’s chief executive to retain separate counsel from the corporation. It has become rare for a lawyer or law firm to represent both a company and its executives in a government investigation.      Mr. Weingarten, 61, is considered a skilled trial lawyer, having won acquittals for Mr. Espy, the former agriculture secretary, and Mark A. Belnick, the former general counsel at Tyco. He has also suffered his share of courtroom defeats. Mr. Ebbers, the head of WorldCom, was found guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.      On Monday, Mr. Weingarten was in the Federal District Court in Manhattan with his client Anthony Cuti, the former chief executive of Duane Reade, the drugstore chain. A judge sentenced Mr. Cuti to three years in prison for a scheme to falsely inflate the income and reduce the expense that the company reported. A jury convicted Mr. Cuti in June 2010.      Mr. Weingarten did not respond to request for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for his law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, declined to comment.      Steptoe is not the firm most closely associated with Goldman. The bank’s primary outside law firm is Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent and old-line New York law firm. Sullivan represented the firm in its 550 million settlement with the S.E.C. Also, when Mr. Blankfein testified as a witness earlier this year in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager, lawyers from Sullivan coached him on his testimony and accompanied him to court.      A native of Newark, Mr. Weingarten is a graduate of Cornell and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State. Before becoming a criminal defense lawyer, he spent several years as a deputy district attorney in Pennsylvania and then joined the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section.      While at the Justice Department, he spent years bringing cases against corrupt politicians and worked with another young prosecutor, Eric H. Holder. Mr. Holder, now the attorney general of the United States, remains one of Mr. Weingarten’s closest friends. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has hired high-profile Washington defense attorney Reid Weingarten as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Just weeks before Christmas, the firm has decided to close its British call centres. The move was condemned by the GMB and Unison unions, who called for a public inquiry into the way Npower is being run. Npower has decided to close its British call centres, axing almost 2,000 staff just weeks before Christmas. It is understood that sites at Peterlee in County Durham, Thornaby in North Yorkshire, and Stoke will be closed, with the transfer of 1,400 jobs to India, while 570 customer service jobs will go to another company in Britain. Npower is owned by RWE of Germany, which earlier this week dumped a project to build a vast wind farm in the Bristol Channel. Colin Smith, of the GMB, said: ‘This is about cost of living, bad management and naked greed.. ‘At this time of the year, when the Christmas lights are being turned on for most people, Npower workers their families and communities have no Yuletide greetings. ‘They have only fear from a company only interested in their fat-cat salaries and what they can get out of consumers who are paying ever higher energy prices so corporate bureaucrats can get fatter as their reward for failure. 'It is an absolute scandal that a company like Npower can operate as a cartel player in a captive market, while jobs are placed offshore.’ Npower is to move all UK call centres to India. Matthew Lay, Unison national officer, said: ‘Npower have consistently let their customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or the latest customer-service techniques. ‘This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including India. ‘If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for service.’ Its poor record on complaints, a punishing 10.2 per cent price rise and its failure to pay tax have angered many customers of Britain’s most expensive energy firm. But chief executive Paul Massara, who earns £600,000, has rejected calls to give up a bonus of £150,000 awarded for hitting targets for employee and customer satisfaction. Just last week, Npower was named and shamed as the nation’s worst performer for customer service. The company receives 202.5 complaints for every 100,000 customers – five times more than the best energy supplier. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at official customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said Npower’s performance was ‘unacceptable’ and it was unclear how moving call centre services to outside firms would improve the situation. She added: ‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust. Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go.’ The firm is also about to hit customers with a 10.2 per cent rise in the cost of heat and light, which will take average bills up by £139 to just under £1,500 a year. Npower said: ‘Npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK to improve customer service and keep costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers’ bills.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Npower, a big energy company, decided to remove a lot of people from their jobs in the UK and move these jobs to a far away place called India. This is because it costs less money for the company to have people working there. Many people are upset because it is happening close to a special holiday called Christmas, and those people who lost their jobs will have a harder time enjoying the holiday. Some people in charge, like the GMB and Unison unions, are really unhappy about this decision and want to investigate if Npower is being managed correctly. This decision might also hurt Npower's reputation, because they already have many unhappy customers due to high prices and bad service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Egyptian researchers believe they have recognized the mummy of Hatshepsut, the most famous queen to rule ancient Egypt, found in an average tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In. In fact, there has been the idea over the years that one of the mummies may be that of the queen, who ruled from between 1503 and 1482 BC - at the height of ancient prefix = st1 /Egypt's power. The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas  _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty . It was guessed that the mummy might have been hidden in the tomb for safekeeping because her stepson and successor  , Tuthmosis III, tried to wipe out her memory. Hatshepsut stole the power from her young stepson. After her death, records were destroyed and her body was dug out.

Select from: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","output":"c. no. The terms \\"Old Kingdom\\" and \\"Middle Kingdom\\" relate to specific periods in the historical timeline of Ancient Egypt, while \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" doesn't correspond to any particular eras in history. Furthermore, \\"left\\" and \\"young\\" are not chronological or historical terms. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of these periods, it is crucial to look at them separately. 1. The Old Kingdom (2686 - 2181 BCE): The Old Kingdom is usually regarded as the first of three golden eras of Ancient Egypt, followed by the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom period is marked by some of Egypt's most well-known accomplishments, primarily in art and architecture. The Old Kingdom era is sometimes referred to as the \\"Age of Pyramids,\\" due to the construction of the most famous Egyptian pyramids during this time. The Step Pyramid of Djoser, the first pyramid of Egypt, built by the architect Imhotep, is a notable example. Other renowned pyramids constructed during this period include the Great Pyramid of Giza, which was built for the Pharaoh Khufu, as well as the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure. During the Old Kingdom, pharaohs and their administrations achieved remarkable political stability and organization. The central government was highly active, and civil service was introduced. The artistic achievements of this period are also significant, as art became more formalized and idealized, setting the standards for later periods. The Old Kingdom finally came to an end because of increasing political instability, regional rivalries, and droughts. This led to a period of decline known as the First Intermediate Period. 2. The Middle Kingdom (2055 - 1650 BCE): The Middle Kingdom is characterized by a period of reunification and stability after the chaos and disarray that marked the First Intermediate Period. The Pharaohs Mentuhotep II and Amenemhat I are credited with reuniting Egypt during this time. This period is known for its significant advancements in various forms of art, literature, and architecture. The Middle Kingdom produced the first known pieces of Egyptian literature, such as the 'Tale of Sinuhe' and the 'Instructions of Amenemhat.' The art of this period exhibits more realism and portrays people in more personal and individual ways, as opposed to the Old Kingdom's formalized style. The Middle Kingdom also saw developments in architectural techniques. The period featured a shift from pyramids to rock-cut tombs. Osiride columns and papyrus capitals were also introduced during this era. The decline of the Middle Kingdom can be attributed to various factors, including weak pharaohs, internal strife, and the invasion of the Hyksos, a group from Western Asia. This decline led to the Second Intermediate Period, which eventually gave way to the New Kingdom, the third major era of Ancient Egypt. In conclusion, \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" does not follow the historical context or timeline of Ancient Egypt. It is important to recognize the specific concepts, achievements, and events of the Old and Middle Kingdoms to better understand their place in the grand narrative of ancient Egyptian civilization."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Question: What do you see for entertainment on a screen? Options: - movie - casino - theatre - show - comedy  The answer is \\"movie\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"movie\\" because movies are a popular form of visual entertainment that are specifically created to be viewed on a screen. They are a versatile and engaging medium that caters to various tastes and preferences, offering a wide range of genres, themes, and narratives to capture the imagination and provide a compelling viewing experience. Movies are an ideal choice for entertainment on a screen because they cater to an individual's or group's specific interests, mood, and desired level of engagement. A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a form of storytelling that uses moving images to tell a fictional or non-fictional narrative. These moving images are created by capturing a series of still images with photographic equipment and then projecting them in rapid succession onto a screen, creating the appearance of continuous motion. The process of creating movies typically involves a combination of various elements, such as cinematography, sound design, editing, and direction, to craft a cohesive and engaging story that is both visually and emotionally captivating. The other options provided - casino, theatre, show, and comedy - may also offer entertainment on a screen, but not in the same way or to the same extent as movies.  Casinos are primarily associated with gambling and gaming, with screen-based entertainment often being a secondary consideration. Casino screens usually display information related to games, such as roulette wheels or slot machines, rather than conveying a comprehensive narrative or evoking an emotional response. Theatre refers to the art of live performance and typically takes place on a stage, not on a screen. Although recorded theatrical performances can be enjoyed on a screen, the primary medium for theatre is still a live, in-person experience. A \\"show\\" is a more general term that can encompass various forms of entertainment, from live performances to television series. In some cases, a show may be an appropriate answer when referring to screen-based entertainment, such as when watching a TV series. However, the term is not as specific or definitive as \\"movie\\" when addressing entertainment on a screen. \\"Comedy\\" is a genre of entertainment rather than a specific format. While it is true that comedy can be enjoyed on a screen in the form of comedic movies or TV shows, the term itself does not directly indicate a screen-based form of entertainment. In summary, the answer \\"movie\\" is the most fitting of the provided options because movies are specifically produced for the purpose of providing visual entertainment on a screen. They encompass a vast array of narrative styles, genres, and themes, making them appealing and engaging to diverse audiences. While the other options may offer varying levels of screen-based entertainment, none of them are as focused, versatile, or universally enjoyable as movies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is Xenodiagnosis?","output":"Xenodiagnosis is a method of identification used for certain infectious agents, particularly when it is difficult to directly demonstrate their presence in a patient. In this technique, an uninfected vector, typically an insect, is allowed to feed on the blood of a person suspected of carrying the infectious agent.

Given the following context:  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister (concert master) of the Weimar Hofkapelle (court chapel) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. The position was created for him, possibly on his demand, giving him \\"a newly defined rank order\\" according to Christoph Wolff.From 1695, an arrangement shared the responsibility for church music at the Schlosskirche (court church) between the Kapellmeister Samuel Drese and the Vize-Kapellmeister Georg Christoph Strattner, who took care of one Sunday per month while the Kapellmeister served on three Sundays. The pattern probably continued from 1704, when Strattner was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm. When Konzertmeister Bach also assumed the principal responsibility for one cantata a month, the Kapellmeister's workload was further reduced to two Sundays per month.The performance venue on the third tier of the court church, in German called Himmelsburg (Heaven's Castle), has been described by Wolff as \\"congenial and intimate\\", calling for a small ensemble of singers and players. Performers of the cantatas were mainly the core group of the Hofkapelle, formed by seven singers, three leaders and five other instrumentalists. Additional players of the military band were available when needed, and also town musicians and singers of the gymnasium. Bach as the concertmaster probably led the performances as the first violinist, while the organ part was played by Bach's students such as Johann Martin Schubart and Johann Caspar Vogler. Even in settings like chamber music, Bach requested a strong continuo section with cello, bassoon and violone in addition to the keyboard instrument.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm?

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.
