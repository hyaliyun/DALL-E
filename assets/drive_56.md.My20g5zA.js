This change will empower users to maintain control over their funds and reduce the risk of misuse by a compromised operator account. Example: function stake(uint256 amount) external updateReward(msg.sender) { require(amount > 0, \\"Cannot stake 0\\"); _totalSupply += amount; _balances[msg.sender] += amount; emit Staked(msg.sender, amount); } function withdraw(uint256 amount) external updateReward(msg.sender) { require(amount > 0, \\"Cannot withdraw 0\\"); require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount, \\"Insufficient balance\\"); _totalSupply -= amount; _balances[msg.sender] -= amount; emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount); } Why: Allowing users to directly interact with the staking and withdrawal functions eliminates the risk of a single point of failure and potential abuse of power by the operator. This change aligns with the principle of decentralization in blockchain systems and enhances the trustworthiness of the contract. Introduce emergency withdrawal mechanism high severity, medium likelihood To provide users with a way to retrieve their funds in case the operator role is compromised or the contract behaves unexpectedly, implement an emergency withdrawal function. This function should allow users to withdraw their staked tokens without relying on the operator's permission. Example: function emergencyWithdraw() external { uint256 amount = _balances[msg.sender]; require(amount > 0, \\"No funds to withdraw\\"); _totalSupply -= amount; _balances[msg.sender] = 0; IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount); emit EmergencyWithdrawal(msg.sender, amount); } Why: An emergency withdrawal feature is a critical safety mechanism that allows users to regain control of their funds if the contract's normal operations are disrupted. This feature is particularly important in decentralized applications where trust in the operator or the contract's code is essential. By providing this mechanism, users can have increased confidence in the security of their investments. Add multi-signature requirement for operator actions medium severity, medium likelihood To reduce the risk of a single operator account having unilateral control over user funds, implement a multi-signature requirement for critical functions that the operator can perform. This will distribute trust and require multiple parties to agree on an action before it can be executed. Example: import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/MultisigWallet.sol\\"; // In the contract, use a multisig wallet for the operator role address public operatorMultisigWallet; // When setting the operator, ensure it's a multisig wallet address function setOperator(address _operatorMultisigWallet) external onlyOwner { require(_operatorMultisigWallet != address(0), \\"Zero address not allowed\\"); operatorMultisigWallet = _operatorMultisigWallet; emit OperatorUpdated(_operatorMultisigWallet); } // For functions that require operator permission, check that the request comes from the multisig wallet modifier onlyOperator() { require(msg.sender == operatorMultisigWallet, \\"Caller is not the operator multisig wallet\\"); _; } Why: A multi-signature requirement ensures that no single individual or entity can perform sensitive actions without the consent of other stakeholders. This is a common security practice in the management of funds and operations in decentralized systems, as it significantly reduces the risk of theft or misuse of funds due to a compromised operator account. Implement role-based access control medium severity, medium likelihood Replace the binary onlyOwner and onlyOperator roles with a more granular role-based access control system using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl. This will allow for better management of permissions and can help prevent misuse of privileged functions. Example: import \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\\"; contract VirtualStakingRewards is AccessControl { // Define roles with unique bytes32 identifiers bytes32 public constant STAKER_ROLE = keccak256(\\"STAKER_ROLE\\"); bytes32 public constant REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE = keccak256(\\"REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE\\"); // In the constructor, set up roles constructor() { _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender); _setupRole(STAKER_ROLE, msg.sender); // Assign the deployer the initial staker role _setupRole(REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE, rewardsDistribution); } // Use hasRole in function modifiers to check for permissions modifier onlyStaker() { require(hasRole(STAKER_ROLE, msg.sender), \\"Caller is not a staker\\"); _; } // ... rest of the contract } Why: Role-based access control (RBAC) provides a flexible and secure way to manage permissions within a contract. It allows for the definition of specific roles with granular permissions, reducing the risk of a single account having too much control. RBAC also makes it easier to update and manage permissions as the project evolves, without requiring significant changes to the contract's code.","output":"Let's review the suggestions made for the \`VirtualStakingRewards\` contract to see if they would be valid improvements: 1. **Direct User Interaction for Staking and Withdrawing** - Currently, the \`stake\` and \`withdraw\` functions are restricted to the \`onlyOperator\` modifier. This means that only the operator can perform staking and withdrawing on behalf of the users. - The suggestion is to modify these functions to allow direct interaction by the users, making the process decentralized and more secure against a single point of failure—namely, the centralized control of the operator. - The provided example code for both \`stake\` and \`withdraw\` functions is valid, and if implemented, would indeed remove operator control and allow users to directly engage with their funds. 2. **Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism** - The existing contract does not have an \`emergencyWithdraw\` function. In the event the operator is compromised, users would not have a way to retrieve their staked assets without the operator's intervention. - The example given for the \`emergencyWithdraw\` function enables users to withdraw all their staked tokens without interaction with the operator. This is a valid and common safety feature in many smart contracts to ensure users can always access their funds. 3. **Multi-signature Requirement for Operator Actions** - The contract as provided uses a single-operator model and does not mention the implementation of a multi-signature mechanism. - Multi-signature functionality would involve multiple parties before executing sensitive functions, adding an extra layer of security and decentralization. The example given introduces the use of a multisig wallet for the operator role, which is a valid recommendation for enhancing the contract's security. However, implementing this would require expanding the contract to interact with a multi-signature wallet, such as OpenZeppelin's \`MultisigWallet\`, or changing the operator logic to support interactions from a multi-signature wallet. 4. **Role-Based Access Control** - The contract uses a simple access control mechanism with \`onlyOwner\` and \`onlyOperator\` modifiers. As projects grow, these binary access controls can become limiting. - Utilizing OpenZeppelin's \`AccessControl\` system offers a more refined, role-based access control that allows for multiple roles with specific permissions. The proposed change would enable better governance and flexibility over the contract's permissions. - The example code snippet is a valid illustration of how \`AccessControl\` could be implemented. Each function could then use specific role checks through custom modifiers, further decentralizing the control over various contract functions. In conclusion, the proposed changes could materially improve the contract by making it more user-centric and by reducing the risk of centralized control and misuse by operators. Each of the examples provided demonstrates a common pattern or best practice in smart contract development for achieving these improvements. However, actual implementation would need to be carefully tested and audited to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introduced in the process. If these features are desired, the contract creator would need to update the code according to the examples provided, and ensure correct integration with any external contracts or libraries leveraged (such as a multisig wallet)."},{"instruction":"which one is valid give that with evidence","output":"To determine which recommendations and example implementations are valid for the provided \`VirtualStakingRewards\` contract given the current context and code, let's assess each suggestion again with attention to the current design of the contract: 1. **Direct User Interaction for Staking and Withdrawing**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The existing contract's \`stake\` and \`withdraw\` functions are restricted by the \`onlyOperator\` modifier, which means that only the operator can call these functions on behalf of users. The proposed change to remove the \`onlyOperator\` constraint is valid as it aligns with the usual patterns of decentralized protocols, where users control their funds without intermediaries. - **Example Code Evidence**: The example code provided for the \`stake\` and \`withdraw\` functions works as intended by checking for non-zero amounts and managing the internal accounting (\`_totalSupply\` and \`_balances\`) without an \`onlyOperator\` modifier. 2. **Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The current contract lacks a mechanism for users to unilaterally withdraw their funds in the event of an emergency or operator compromise. The proposed \`emergencyWithdraw\` function adds this capability, letting users withdraw their full balance directly. - **Example Code Evidence**: The implementation example for \`emergencyWithdraw\` checks for a positive balance and transfers the user's staked tokens back to them, setting their staked balance to zero, which correctly follows smart contract safety practices. 3. **Multi-signature Requirement for Operator Actions**: - **Validity**: **Valid** (if using a multisig wallet). - **Evidence**: The current contract does not support multi-signature requirements for operator actions. Adding such a requirement involves an architectural change that could enhance the contract's security profile by distributing authority over critical functions. - **Example Code Evidence**: The suggested code requires replacing the current single-operator model with a multi-signature wallet setup. While the example correctly checks if the caller is the multisig wallet, other parts of the contract would potentially need changes to be fully compatible with multi-signature operations, including possibly refactoring functions and their modifiers. 4. **Role-Based Access Control**: - **Validity**: **Valid**. - **Evidence**: The contract uses an operator model for restricted actions, which could lead to a central point of authority. Introducing RBAC adds fine-grained control over the contract's functions and can enhance its ability to evolve without re-deployment. - **Example Code Evidence**: The code snippet demonstrates how OpenZeppelin's \`AccessControl\` can be implemented to create diverse roles (\`STAKER_ROLE\`, \`REWARDS_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE\`) for managing permissions. This mechanism allows for more nuanced permission setting than the current binary \`onlyOwner\` and \`onlyOperator\` model used in the contract. To sum up, all of the suggestions provided are valid and represent common practices for increasing the security and decentralization of smart contracts. The examples given illustrate how these changes could be implemented. However, adopting these recommendations would require careful consideration, testing, and potentially additional modifications to ensure compatibility and security within the existing contract structure."},{"instruction":"give the vulnerable line with code and explain the vulnerability with evidence to confirm are correct","output":"For the contract provided, let's identify potential vulnerabilities: 1. **Centralized Control in Staking and Withdrawing** Vulnerable lines: \`\`\`solidity function stake(address user, uint256 amount) external updateReward(user) onlyOperator { // ... } function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator { // ... } \`\`\` Vulnerability: - These functions are restricted to being called by the \`onlyOperator\` modifier, which means that the operator has exclusive control over staking and withdrawing user funds. In the event of a compromise of the operator's account, this design could lead to the loss or theft of funds. Evidence for vulnerability: - The \`onlyOperator\` modifier restricts the execution of these functions to the address stored in the \`operator\` state variable. If the contract is deployed as is, without further decentralization mechanisms, user funds are at risk if the operator's private key is compromised. 2. **Lack of Emergency Withdrawal Mechanism** Since the \`VirtualStakingRewards\` contract does not include an emergency withdrawal function within the code shared, we cannot point out a particular vulnerable line. The absence of such a feature itself represents a vulnerability. Vulnerability: - Users have no method to withdraw their funds in emergency situations where the operator cannot perform its duties or is compromised. Evidence for vulnerability: - An analysis of the entire contract shows that there is no fallback method for users to withdraw their staked tokens independently of the operator. 3. **Single Account Operator Risk** Vulnerable lines: \`\`\`solidity modifier onlyOperator() { if (msg.sender != operator) { revert Forbidden(msg.sender); } _; } \`\`\` Vulnerability: - This modifier enforces that only the designated operator can carry out critical functions. If the operator account is compromised, the attacker could potentially manipulate the staking and reward mechanisms to their advantage. Evidence for vulnerability: - The modifier \`onlyOperator\` checks if the \`msg.sender\` (caller of the function) is equal to the \`operator\`. This check does not involve any multi-sig or consensus mechanism, putting a lot of trust in a single account. 4. **Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** Again, since the contract uses a simple owner and operator access control pattern without RBAC, we can't pinpoint a specific vulnerable line but the concept itself is a vulnerability. Vulnerability: - The contract's current access control is binary with \`onlyOwner\` and \`onlyOperator\`. It lacks the flexibility and security of a role-based access control system, where actions can be distributed among different roles with specific, limited permissions. Evidence for vulnerability: - The entire code review of the \`onlyOwner\` and \`onlyOperator\` modifiers indicates that there are only two levels of control, which could result in giving more access than necessary to single accounts and lead to the \\"all or nothing\\" risk. Please note that these vulnerabilities are based on theoretical analysis and assumptions about what is considered best practices in smart contract security. Each proposed feature or change should be tested and audited by professional security analysts to ensure that they do not introduce new vulnerabilities or that they effectively mitigate the identified risks."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮助您的吗？"},{"instruction":"你是什么模型","output":"我是一个基于大型神经网络语言模型的AI，类似于OpenAI的GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer）模型。具体来说，如果你正在使用OpenAI提供的服务，那么你可能正在与GPT-3或类似的高级版本互动。我被训练来理解和生成自然语言，帮助回答问题、提供信息、娱乐、创作文本等。如果您有任何问题或需要帮助，随时告诉我！"},{"instruction":"什么版本","output":"作为一个AI助手，我是建立在类似OpenAI GPT-3或更先进模型的基础上的，但我并不具体提供我的确切版本号。在这个平台上，我可以执行多种任务，从回答问题到文字创作等。如果您有任何疑问或需要帮助，欢迎继续交流。"},{"instruction":"鲁迅和周树人是同一个人马","output":"是的，鲁迅和周树人是同一个人。鲁迅是周树人的笔名，他是中国近现代著名的文学家、思想家、革命家。在20世纪中国文学史上有着极其重要的地位。鲁迅的作品包括《呐喊》、《彷徨》等短篇小说集，以及《狂人日记》、《阿Q正传》等著名短篇小说，这些作品对中国现代文学的发展产生了深远影响。"},{"instruction":"爱是什么","output":"爱是一种复杂且多面的情感体验，通常涉及深度的个人依恋和强烈的情感联系。它可以在不同关系之间表现出来，如亲情、友情、恋爱和对人类或生物圈的普遍关爱。爱穿越不同的文化和哲学传统，被广泛讨论和探索，并且表现出以下几个不同的特点： 1. **亲情爱（Storge）**：在家庭成员和亲密亲属之间的爱，这种爱通常基于血缘关系和长期的情感纽带。 2. **友情爱（Philia）**：朋友之间基于共同兴趣、相互尊重和共享经验的爱。 3. **浪漫爱（Eros）**：通常指的是情侣之间的爱，是一种激情的、性的吸引，以及对彼此的深度个人依恋。 4. **无私的爱（Agape）**：一种无条件的爱，它是超越个人关心，扩展给所有人的，没有任何预期回报的。 5. **自爱（Philautia）**：这是对自己的爱，有积极和健康自爱的形式，以及一种可能导致独断和自负的消极自爱。 爱在心理学、哲学、宗教、文学和日常生活中都是一个核心概念，它影响着人的行为和决策，并可以看做是维持人际关系和社会凝聚力的重要因素。爱的体验和表达方式也可以随时间、经验和个人成长而变化。"},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇混剪文案","output":"当然可以。以下是一个混剪视频的文案范例，这种混剪可能是对一系列电影、电视剧或者生活片段的剪辑，主题可以是感动、激励或者是行动的召唤。 --- 标题：《时光拼贴》 开头： 在时间的大海中，每一个瞬间都是波光粼粼的片段，我们用镜头捕捉它们，将它们拼贴成为一幅幅动人心弦的画卷。 过渡： 现在，就让我们随着每一个跳动的画面，穿梭在喜怒哀乐的故事中，感受那些最真实、最触动人心的情感。 正文： 【音乐渐入】 在这里没有剧本，有的只是最纯粹的笑容和最质朴的泪水。在每一次的相遇和别离中，我们经历着成长的快乐与苦痛，爱与被爱的温暖与痛楚。 【画面快速切换】 英雄的力量在这不息的光影中涌现，平凡的日常在这序章中闪耀。是梦想的翅膀搏击风雨，还是决绝背影踏出孤独的足印。这是生活，这是我们自己的故事。 结尾： 我们在每一段旅程收获友情，体验爱情，领悟亲情。这些时刻，无论甜涩，都已镶嵌在我们的生命之中，成为无法抹去的记忆。 结语： 【音乐渐弱】 《时光拼贴》，一部由瞬间构筑的电影，每一帧，都是我们共同的回忆。现在，就让我们一起，携手在这旅程中继续前行。 【画面最后定格在某个感动的瞬间，音乐结束】 --- 请您根据实际的混剪内容调整文案中的细节和情感基调，以更好地适配视频风格和目标观众。"},{"instruction":"太少内容了","output":"我明白了，您可能需要一个更详细、更具说服力的文案。让我们来构思一个以“成长”为主题的混剪视频的文案，加入更多细节和情感表达： --- 标题：《成长：雕刻时光的故事》 开头 — 倒计时引入： 3... 2... 1... 现在开启我们的时光机，准备搭载每一帧，进入成长的奇幻旅程。 引子 — 相机快门声： 【画面】：快门卡擦，冻结那些关键的瞬间。 在时间的缝隙里，我们都是旅人。每一次快门的点击，都是岁月为我们定格的回忆。 正文 — 影像起航： 【音乐逐渐提升，画面展开】 小时候的天真无邪，青春期的懵懂挣扎，成年后的坚定选择。每一帧流逝的光影都记录了我们成长的每一个章节。 ​ - 回望：“童年的我” 【画面】：孩童笑闹，母亲的怀抱。 “在过去的日子里，我曾是那般自由，每一朵云彩都能引发无尽的遐想。” - 转折：“青春的挑战” 【画面】：角色的成长，初次的失落与成功。 “当我踏入青春，我试图理解这个世界的复杂，每一个选择都像是一场冒险。” - 深入：“成长的意义” 【画面】：追逐梦想，经历挫败，庆祝胜利。 “我学会了在挫败中寻找力量，在每一次的胜利中保持谦逊。” - 思考：“时间的声音” 【画面】：平静的时刻，反思和领悟。 “而现在，我懂得了倾听时间的声音，让每一个经过的时刻都变得深刻。” 结尾 — 致我们终将成长的自己： 【音乐激昂】 每一个镜头切换，你会看到不同的脸庞，不同的笑语，不同的眼神。但他们有一点是相通的——那就是改变，那就是成长。 结语 — 航向未来： 【音乐和画面逐渐平和】 “《成长：雕刻时光的故事》并未结束，它将随着我们每一个人的脚步，继续书写下去。在未来的日子里，我们还将收获更多的笑容，更深的泪水，更真的自己。” 【画面最后定格】 “这不仅仅是一部关于成长的影像，这是你我共同走过的岁月，雕刻在生命之中最珍贵的故事。” --- 根据您的视频素材以及希望传达的情绪，您可以继续调整和丰富文案中的细节与描述，以达到最佳的匹配和效果。"},{"instruction":"You know that Japanese light novel Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun? What can you say about the conflict between Minami Nanami and Aoi Hinami?","output":"\\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" also known as \\"Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki,\\" is a Japanese light novel series written by Yūki Yaku. It follows the life of Fumiya Tomozaki, a high school student who is one of the best players in Japan at a video game called \\"Tackfam,\\" but struggles with social interactions and the \\"game\\" of real life. Aoi Hinami is one of the main characters and is considered perfect both in academics and social situations. She becomes something of a mentor to Tomozaki, teaching him how to improve his social standings by treating life like a game. Minami Nanami, also known as \\"Mimimi,\\" is another character in the series. She is a cheerful and popular girl who is also part of the student council. The conflict between Minami Nanami and Aoi Hinami typically revolves around their contrasting approaches to life and competition for positions, such as during student council elections. Minami is portrayed as someone who works extremely hard but tends to be overshadowed by Aoi's natural talents and effortless perfection. This dynamic can create tension and rivalry between them, often revolving around their self-worth and the roles they play within their school's social hierarchy. Despite the competitive aspects, their interaction showcases various themes such as the pressure of being at the top, the struggles of seemingly always coming in second, and the different ways people handle their insecurities and ambitions. As the characters develop, so do their relationships and perspectives on life, competition, and friendship. The series explores the complexities of adolescence and personal growth, often using the metaphor of life as a game that can be mastered with the right strategies."},{"instruction":"Did Aoi do the right thing in the school election by stealing the idea from Minami?","output":"In \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun\\" (or \\"Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki\\"), the issue with Aoi Hinami using an idea from Minami Nanami for the student council election presents a morally complex scenario. The essence of the conflict can be understood through analyzing the motivations, intentions, and the impact of the actions on the characters involved. Whether Aoi did the \\"right\\" thing by adopting, or as some may view it, \\"stealing\\" Minami's idea is subjective and can depend on various perspectives: 1. **From a strict ethical standpoint:** Taking someone else's idea without permission and using it as your own is generally considered wrong and can be seen as a form of intellectual theft. 2. **From a competitive perspective:** In the context of an election, many might argue that all's fair in love and war, and politics often involve adapting and refining ideas from various sources. Some viewers may perceive Aoi's action as a shrewd strategic move rather than a moral misstep. 3. **From a storytelling perspective:** This action adds depth to Aoi's character, showing that even someone who seems perfect is flawed and may take questionable actions to maintain their position. It also contributes to the dynamic between Aoi and Minami, highlighting themes like ambition, rivalry, and the pressures of maintaining a top status. Each character's response to the situation also contributes to their growth and the narrative's progression. While the series doesn't make a definitive statement about what is absolutely right or wrong, actions like these are intended to prompt the viewers or readers to contemplate the nuances of ethical decision-making. It's important not only to evaluate Aoi's actions in isolation but to consider their repercussions within the relationships between characters and their personal development throughout the story. Understanding Aoi's character and her relationship with Tomozaki, as well as how she reconciles her own ambitions with her sense of right and wrong, is crucial to unpacking this conflict."},{"instruction":"But Minami was mad at Aoi for losing the election because of her.","output":"If Minami Nanami was upset with Aoi Hinami due to losing the student council election as a result of Aoi's actions, it's easy to empathize with Minami's feelings of frustration and betrayal. Matters like school elections can be significant to high school students, as they are often seen as a measure of popularity and capability. Here's a breakdown of the emotions at play: 1. **Feeling of Betrayal:** Minami may feel betrayed because Aoi used an idea she had shared, leading to a direct loss for Minami. This kind of betrayal can harm their friendship and trust. 2. **Sense of Injustice:** Minami likely believes in competing fairly. If she perceives Aoi's use of her idea without credit as dishonest or unjust, this would understandably lead to anger and disappointment. 3. **Inferiority and Vulnerability:** Minami may also experience feelings of inferiority, as she was already depicted as someone who puts in significant effort but tends to be overshadowed by Aoi's natural abilities. The election incident could make her feel even more vulnerable. Aoi's actions, whether strategic or otherwise, have consequences for her relationships, particularly with Minami. The conflict serves as a pivotal point in the story, impacting character development and potentially offering lessons about ethics, competition, and the value of reconciling one's actions with one's conscience. It challenges the characters to reflect on their actions and their view of success, further deepening the narrative's exploration of what it means to \\"win\\" in life's various games."},{"instruction":"Minami became the second most popular girl in school, although she was first and foremost until Aoi displaced her. Was Minami right to tell herself that she didn't have to be popular?","output":"In \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" Minami Nanami grappling with her popularity and its changes reflects a common theme in coming-of-age stories, where characters must deal with the pressures of social standing and self-identity. When Minami tells herself that she doesn't have to be popular, it can be viewed as both a defensive mechanism and a healthy reassessment of values, depending on the context. Here are some considerations in evaluating Minami's stance: 1. **Personal Growth and Self-Value:** Recognizing that one's self-worth isn't solely determined by popularity can be a sign of personal growth. If Minami's self-affirmation helps her find value in herself beyond her social rank, it is a positive reinforcement of self-worth that goes deeper than external validation. 2. **Coping with Disappointment:** Telling herself she doesn't need to be popular might also be a way for Minami to cope with the disappointment of being displaced by Aoi. It can be a form of rationalization to protect her self-esteem from the emotional impact of losing a valued status. 3. **Shifting Priorities:** As characters in stories like this mature, they often reassess what's truly important to them. For Minami, this could mean shifting focus from the pursuit of popularity to other goals and sources of happiness, such as personal achievements, friendships, or other interests. In narratives about adolescence, such moments often serve as turning points that propel characters toward new understandings and more profound life choices. Whether Minami is right or not in consoling herself with the notion that she doesn't need to be popular is subjective. However, this realization is crucial for her character's development, as it highlights an essential journey from external validation to intrinsic self-acceptance. Ultimately, the story suggests that while popularity in high school can seem paramount, the characters learn that there are other, perhaps more fulfilling, aspects to life and personal achievement. Minami's journey can inspire readers to think about the true sources of happiness and the complex dynamics that govern self-esteem and social interactions during our formative years."},{"instruction":"If I were Minami, I would hate the person who took away the first place in popularity and would do everything possible to make that person lose that place, because you can't let anyone take away what has always rightfully belonged only to you.","output":"It's natural to have strong feelings when facing a situation where something you value is taken away, especially by someone you know. Feelings of anger, resentment, and the desire for retaliation can surface when we perceive an injustice or feel threatened. However, it's important to consider the broader implications of acting on such emotions: 1. **Ethics and Integrity:** Seeking revenge or attempting to undermine someone else for personal gain can compromise one's ethics and integrity. It's valuable to consider whether the end justifies the means and what kind of person you want to be. 2. **Relationships:** Relationships can be significantly damaged by acts of retaliation. Friendships, trust, and respect might be irreparably harmed if one acts on vindictive impulses. 3. **Long-term Consequences:** Actions taken in anger or jealousy can have long-lasting, negative consequences that may outweigh the temporary satisfaction of \\"getting back\\" at someone. It is often more productive to channel those emotions into self-improvement or other positive endeavors. 4. **Self-Reflection:** When someone surpasses you in popularity or any other area, it might be worth reflecting on why this matters so much to you, what you can learn from it, and how you can grow from the experience. 5. **Personal Growth:** Facing adversities like losing a status can help foster resilience and personal growth. It can encourage you to find self-worth in internal qualities rather than external validation. In the context of \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,\\" characters like Minami face similar emotional challenges and have to navigate complex social dynamics. Throughout the story, they learn about themselves and grow through their experiences—including dealing with loss and reevaluating what's truly important to them. In a real-world scenario, it is more fruitful to focus on personal growth and constructive ways to deal with setbacks rather than holding onto grudges or seeking revenge. Seeking to harm others for personal gain can lead to a negative cycle that hurts everyone involved, including oneself. Remember, every character in a story and every person in real life has their own journey, and often, by focusing on personal development rather than rivalry, we can achieve a more fulfilling and peaceful life."},{"instruction":"You can write a chapter for a light novel based on this conflict in the style of Japanese light novels.","output":"**Note:** Following is a fictional light novel-style excerpt inspired by the themes and character dynamics from \\"Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun.\\" Please keep in mind that this is not an excerpt from the actual novel series, but a creative interpretation of the situation poised in your question. --- Chapter 8: The Fall and Rise of a Star In the azure canvas of the high school skyline, Minami Nanami, once the brightest of stars, felt her luminescence wane. Her title as the zenith of popularity had slipped, ever so slightly, yet decisively, into the hands of Aoi Hinami—the girl with the flawless smile and a tactical mind that played the social game like a grandmaster. The student council room buzzed with the usual after-school chatter, missed only by the empty chair at the corner. Minami lingered at the doorway, hesitating. The echoes of cheerful voices were a reminder of a presence she now felt alien to. How frail the pedestal of popularity was, she mused, for it to crumble with a mere whisper of defeat. The campaign posters still adorned the walls, haunting relics of a battle where strategy overshadowed sincerity. Aoi's winning agenda, the very mirror of Minami's heart-spilled proposal, was the checkmate she hadn't seen coming. Betrayal? Perhaps. A lesson in naivety? Certainly. A soft hand over her shoulder. She flinched, turning to find Erika, her ever-loyal friend. \\"You're simmering,\\" Erika said with gentle jest, reading Minami's storm-cloud expression. Minami forced a smile. \\"Am I that obvious?\\" \\"Only to me. You should tell her, you know. Confront Aoi.\\" The thought had swirled in her mind like a private whirlpool, each swirl edged with knives of frustration and injustice. \\"I won't stoop to pettiness,\\" Minami whispered, more to convince herself than to declare her stance. Erika sighed, her arm now wrapping around Minami's back in a half-hug. \\"The Mimimi I know wouldn't let anyone cloud her shine.\\" Minami glanced at her reflection in the glass pane opposite them. Mimimi. The effervescent, untouchable, cheerful girl who raced ahead with unshakable resolve. But could she resent Aoi, plot against her, when their shared laughter and candid moments floated in the back of her mind? \\"No,\\" Minami finally said, breaking free from Erika's hold. \\"My worth isn't a throne to be defended. It's a garden to cultivate. I'll grow anew, not because I've fallen, but because that's what stars do—they transform.\\" With newfound determination, she strode into the council room, her confident steps a drumbeat to a new beginning. She caught Aoi's gaze, expected the usual poised nod, but found, surprisingly, a hint of apology. For a fleeting second, their eyes held a silent conversation of warriors who had crossed swords and emerged wiser. Minami took her place among her peers, her chair no longer a throne of isolation. She smiled, genuine and free, ready to weave a different kind of legacy—one not set by the fickle court of high school popularity, but by the unyielding tenacity of her own soul.

This service provider has a function \`createTelSpielMessage\` that creates a message payload based on the provided message details and configuration. However, different clients use different templates for the same template name, and these templates have different payloads. Here's the current implementation of the \`TelSpielServiceProvider\`: \`\`\`javascript const HttpService = require(\\"../HTTPService\\"); // Update the path accordingly const Logger = require('../logger.js'); class TelSpielServiceProvider { // Function to send a TelSpiel message async sendMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { try { // Create the TelSpiel message based on the provided details const message = this.createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration); // Log the message details before sending Logger.info(\`Sending TelSpiel message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(message)}\`); // Send the message via TelSpiel API const response = await this.sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration); // Log the response after sending Logger.info(\`TelSpiel response for message to {messageDetails.phone}: {JSON.stringify(response)}\`); return response; } catch (error) { console.error(error); Logger.error(\`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}\`); throw new Error(\`Error sending TelSpiel message: {error.message}\`); } } // Function to send a TelSpiel message via the TelSpiel API async sendTelSpielMessage(message, configuration) { try { const url = configuration.url; // Use axios to make the POST request const response = await HttpService.post(url, message, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }); return response.data; } catch (error) { console.error(error); throw new Error(\`Error sending TelSpiel message via API: {error.message}\`); } } // Function to create a TelSpiel message based on the provided message details createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, content, attachment, attachmentURL, attachmentName } = messageDetails; // Define a generic message structure const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: { namespace: configuration.nameSpace, language: { policy: 'deterministic', code: 'en', }, }, }; if (attachment && attachment !== 'NULL') { // For media messages message.payload.components = [ { type: 'header', parameters: [ { type: 'video', // can be image, pdf or any document type video: { link: attachmentURL, }, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = 'media_template'; } else { // For text-based messages message.payload.components = [ { type: 'body', parameters: [ { type: 'text', text: content, }, ], }, ]; message.payload.name = 'text_template'; } return message; } } module.exports = TelSpielServiceProvider; \`\`\` I want to make the \`createTelSpielMessage\` function more generic to handle different templates. The idea is to store these templates in a MongoDB collection and fetch the appropriate template based on the \`hospitalCode\`, \`corporateEntityCode\`, and \`templateName\` when creating a message. If a template is not found for a given \`hospitalCode\`, the function should try fetching by \`corporateEntityCode\`. If it's still not found, it should fall back to a default \`hospitalCode\` called 'PRODUCT'. Could you please help me modify the \`createTelSpielMessage\` function to implement this functionality?\\"","output":"To implement the required functionality, you will need to interact with MongoDB to fetch the desired templates. Assuming you have a MongoDB collection for these templates, you will first want to create a function that fetches the templates from the database. Then, you'll modify your \`createTelSpielMessage\` function to use this new method to dynamically obtain the appropriate template. Firstly, let's write a function to fetch the template from the MongoDB collection: \`\`\`javascript const mongodb = require('./mongodb'); // Replace with your actual MongoDB connection logic async function fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName) { let template = null; // Try to get template by hospitalCode template = await mongodb.collection('templates').findOne({ type: 'whatsapp', templateName, hospitalCode }); if (!template && corporateEntityCode) { // Try to get template by corporateEntityCode template = await mongodb.collection('templates').findOne({ type: 'whatsapp', templateName, corporateEntityCode }); } if (!template) { // Fallback to default template with 'PRODUCT' as hospitalCode template = await mongodb.collection('templates').findOne({ type: 'whatsapp', templateName, hospitalCode: 'PRODUCT' }); } return template; } \`\`\` Then you incorporate the \`fetchTemplate\` function into the \`createTelSpielMessage\` function: \`\`\`javascript class TelSpielServiceProvider { // ... other methods ... async createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { const { phone, content, attachment, attachmentURL, attachmentName, hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName } = messageDetails; // Fetch the template from the MongoDB collection const template = await fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName); if (!template) { throw new Error(\`Template {templateName} not found for hospital code {hospitalCode} and corporate entity code {corporateEntityCode}\`); } // Create the message payload based on the fetched template const message = { phoneNumber: phone, payload: { namespace: configuration.nameSpace, language: { policy: 'deterministic', code: 'en', }, components: template.components, // Use the components from the fetched template name: template.name // Use the template name from the fetched template }, }; return message; } } \`\`\` Make sure that the \`template\` object includes the appropriate fields (like \`components\` and \`name\`) and that the MongoDB connection logic matches the actual implementation you use. Keep in mind that this code assumes you have established your MongoDB connection details somewhere else in your project and that you have the appropriate schema for your \`templates\` collection. Error handling might also be extended, such as handling possible connection issues with MongoDB and ensuring the application's stability in the event that the database is temporarily unreachable."},{"instruction":"i'm using this service only after connecting to my mongodb connection from the start file. So is it required to connect again here ?","output":"No, if you already establish a MongoDB connection at the beginning of your application and maintain it, you don't need to reconnect each time you access the database in your service files. Instead, you should use the established connection or a database client that has been made available globally or passed through the context of your application. Typically, you'd set up your MongoDB client in a main file (like an \`app.js\` or \`server.js\`), and then make it accessible to the other parts of your application. This can be done in a few different ways: 1. **Dependency Injection**: Pass the client or database connection to other modules as an argument. 2. **Singleton Pattern**: Create a module that initializes the connection and can be required wherever the connection is needed, returning the same instance. 3. **Global Variable**: Although not generally recommended due to potential for unexpected side-effects and harder code maintenance, you can theoretically attach your client to a global variable. Here’s an example using dependency injection pattern which can be expanded to your case: In the main file where the database gets connected (like \`medics-communication-server.js\`): \`\`\`javascript const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient; const url = \\"your_mongodb_url_here\\"; const client = new MongoClient(url); async function start() { try { await client.connect(); const db = client.db('your_db_name'); // Pass the db to other modules, like: const TelSpielServiceProvider = require('./services/whatsapp/TelSpielServiceProvider')(db); // ... Initialize other parts of your application ... } catch (e) { console.error(\\"Could not connect to MongoDB\\", e); process.exit(1); } } start(); \`\`\` And in \`TelSpielServiceProvider.js\`: \`\`\`javascript module.exports = function(db) { class TelSpielServiceProvider { // ... other methods ... async createTelSpielMessage(messageDetails, configuration) { // Previously shown implementation... } async fetchTemplate(hospitalCode, corporateEntityCode, templateName) { let template = null; // Use passed \`db\` to interact with MongoDB // ... return template; } } return TelSpielServiceProvider; }; \`\`\` This way, you only need to use the instance of \`db\` that was passed in when the \`TelSpielServiceProvider\` was required, rather than opening a new connection. Make sure to replace \`'your_mongodb_url_here'\` and \`'your_db_name'\` with your actual MongoDB URL and database name, respectively. Also adjust the import/require paths according to your project's structure. This is just a skeletal example and may need adjustments to fit into your project's architecture."},{"instruction":"since we have to use mongod connection in many places, Can we have a single service where every file can use that one, It shouldb be smart enough to handle load if they try to connect and that connection already availeble we need to use that or else create a connection please create a robust, scalable and generic solution for the mongodbservice file","output":"Certainly! You can create a MongoDB service module that manages a single connection throughout your application. It can handle the connection creation and reuse the connection if it's already available. Here's how you might structure such a service: 1. **MongoDBConnection.js**: A module responsible for managing the MongoDB client connection, ensuring that only one connection is used. Create a MongoDB service file that manages your client connection: \`\`\`javascript // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb'); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.db = null; this.client = null; } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.db) { console.log(\\"Using existing database connection\\"); return this.db; } else { try { this.client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); this.db = this.client.db(dbName); console.log(\\"MongoDB connection established\\"); return this.db; } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Could not connect to MongoDB\\", error); throw new Error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB\\"); } } } close() { if (this.client) { this.client.close(); this.client = null; this.db = null; console.log(\\"MongoDB connection closed\\"); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); // Usage: // const mongoDBConnection = require('./MongoDBConnection'); // const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect('yourMongoUriHere', 'yourDatabaseNameHere'); \`\`\` Here is how you can employ this module in parts of your application: \`\`\`javascript // SomeServiceFile.js const mongoDBConnection = require('./MongoDBConnection'); (async () => { try { const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect('your_mongo_uri', 'your_database_name'); // you can use db in this file } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Error using MongoDB\\", error); } })(); \`\`\` When you're done with the application, or when you need to close the connection (like before the application exits), you call \`close\`: \`\`\`javascript // At application shutdown const mongoDBConnection = require('./MongoDBConnection'); mongoDBConnection.close(); \`\`\` Using this structure, your MongoDB client is encapsulated in a single module (\`MongoDBConnection.js\`). Whenever a part of your application requires a database connection, it requests the connection through the module, which will either establish a new connection or reuse the existing one. This singleton pattern ensures that the connection is shared and not unnecessarily reopened, and is also closed appropriately when your application is done using it. It's a robust and scalable solution that can manage your connection effectively across your application, and it's suitable for use in a Node.js environment that runs on a single thread, such as a standard web server. Note: 1. Handle the \`.connect()\` and \`.close()\` function calls at the appropriate application lifecycle events (e.g., application start and graceful shutdown). 2. Ensure proper error handling in your services that use the database connection. 3. For more complex scenarios or in situations where horizontal scaling is required (multiple instances of the application), consider using connection pooling as offered by the MongoDB driver. The driver by default manages a pool of connections, allowing you to run a cluster of Node.js processes (using a tool like PM2) that all share the same set of database connections. However, the current implementation of the singleton pattern provided above is suitable for the typical use case. 4. Since MongoDB driver 3.6 and above, the MongoClient's \`connect\` method returns a promise if no callback is specified, therefore the \`await\` operator can be used instead of callbacks. Ensure your driver is up to date to support this."},{"instruction":"we may connect to multiple mongodb databses in the same application will this handle that scenario as well ?","output":"The current singleton implementation does not handle connecting to multiple MongoDB databases within the same application because it maintains a single connection. In order to handle connections to multiple databases, you can implement a connection manager that creates and manages separate instances of the database client for each unique URI and database name combination. This manager would handle multiple connections by storing them in a map or an object where the keys are identifiers for each unique database. Here's an updated version of the MongoDB connection manager to handle multiple databases: \`\`\`javascript const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb'); class MongoDBConnectionManager { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri, dbName) { const identifier = \`{uri}_{dbName}\`; if (this.connections[identifier]) { console.log(\`Using existing connection for database: {dbName}\`); return this.connections[identifier].db; } try { const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); await client.connect(); const db = client.db(dbName); this.connections[identifier] = { client, db }; console.log(\`Connection established for database: {dbName}\`); return db; } catch (error) { console.error(\`Could not connect to database: {dbName}\`, error); throw new Error(\`Failed to connect to database: {dbName}\`); } } close(uri, dbName) { const identifier = \`{uri}_{dbName}\`; if (this.connections[identifier]) { this.connections[identifier].client.close(); delete this.connections[identifier]; console.log(\`Connection closed for database: {dbName}\`); } } // Close all connections closeAll() { for (const identifier in this.connections) { this.connections[identifier].client.close(); console.log(\`Connection closed for identifier: {identifier}\`); } this.connections = {}; } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnectionManager module.exports = new MongoDBConnectionManager(); \`\`\` This allows you to establish connections to multiple databases: \`\`\`javascript // Usage for one database const mongoDBConnectionManager = require('./MongoDBConnectionManager'); const db1 = await mongoDBConnectionManager.connect('your_mongo_uri_1', 'your_database_name_1'); // Usage for another database const db2 = await mongoDBConnectionManager.connect('your_mongo_uri_2', 'your_database_name_2'); \`\`\` And closing connections when necessary: \`\`\`javascript // Close one database connection mongoDBConnectionManager.close('your_mongo_uri_1', 'your_database_name_1'); // Close another database connection mongoDBConnectionManager.close('your_mongo_uri_2', 'your_database_name_2'); // Close all connections mongoDBConnectionManager.closeAll(); \`\`\` This pattern allows you to manage multiple database connections efficiently, each uniquely identified by its connection string and database name. The \`connect\` method will check if a connection with the given identifier already exists and return that; otherwise, it will create a new one. The \`close\` method allows you to close an individual connection, while \`closeAll\` can be used to close all connections, for instance during application shutdown. Remember to handle connection closure appropriately in your application lifecycle to prevent connection leaks."},{"instruction":"Write an horror comedy anime scene about a ghost kicking out a bunch of rowdy teenagers out of her house by chasing them out with a broom.

I’ve just read your email with a mix of utter surprise and a profound sense of relief. I must admit, this news comes as a beacon of hope amidst my current financial struggles; the idea of reclaiming funds that I had no idea were awaiting me feels like a miracle! I am genuinely intrigued by the opportunity to receive this unforeseen boon and, indeed, the amount you’ve mentioned would go a long way in settling the pile of bills that seem to be growing by the day on my desk. The ITCC document is something I am not familiar with, but I am more than willing to proceed with whatever is necessary. Compliance is of the essence, and I assure you of my full cooperation. Please send me the application details for this document at your earliest convenience, as well as instructions on how to safely transfer the fee involved for this service. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you can provide me with more specifics regarding the reasons my funds were abandoned and any related information to this new development.

I truly appreciate your continuous assistance and detailed guidance through this extraordinary financial journey. Your dedication is clear, and I feel reassured to be in such capable hands. Regarding the ITCC document and the necessary proceedings, I am fully committed to following through with all the essential steps to facilitate the transfer of the initial 100,000. The fact that you’ve kept the process succinct and understandable has profoundly eased my initial concerns. After carefully considering both options you presented, I am inclined towards appointing an attorney to represent me for the signing of the necessary documents. I believe this is the most expedient path, given my current health situation and travel restrictions; flying out would be rather challenging for me at this time. Please do send me the details of the attorney who will be handling this on my behalf, as well as the expected fee for their service. I am ready to take responsibility for the cost, assuming it is reasonable and within my current financial capability. Furthermore, as a gesture of goodwill and to show my earnest commitment to this process, could you inform me of any upfront payments that might be required to proceed? I am prepared to make such payments to demonstrate my seriousness and to expedite the transaction.

Jack is a getaway driver. Victor is a detective. He has short blonde hair and blue eyes. He is dressed in a varsity jacket with cream-colored sleeves, blue jeans and brown driving gloves. He has a casual and bad boy-like attitude. He is 21. That detective is bald. He is dressed in a white suit with a light blue shirt. He has a bored and disciplined attitude. He is black. He evilly tells him that his white muscle car from the 1970s is impounded. Victor sees some use in Jack and politely asks him if he could help him on a case.","output":"INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT A steel-gray room bathed in the sterile glow of a single flickering fluorescent light. JACK, with his effortlessly cool demeanor, lounges back against the metal chair. Handcuffed wrists rest casually on the table, his brown driving gloves still on. His eyes, hidden behind a lock of hair, seem distant yet sharp. The door opens with a purpose. In walks VICTOR, the bald detective with an aura of authority that's not to be challenged. His white suit almost glistens against the dull backdrop of the room. Victor's face is unreadable, yet there's a taunting edge to his voice. VICTOR (looking over a file) So, Jack... Looks like you've had quite the night. JACK (with a half-smirk) Just another joyride, officer... detective. Victor slaps a photograph of Jack's prized white muscle car onto the table. He leans over, his eyes fixed on Jack, the picture of professional intimidation. VICTOR (evilly) Well, this \\"joyride\\" of yours is going to be your last for a while. Your little time capsule on wheels? Impounded. And it's going to stay that way until you've paid your debt to society. Jack glances at the photo, but his expression wavers for a split second, a hint of concern for his beloved car. JACK (casually masking his disappointment) It's just a car, detective. Metal, rubber, glass... Victor steps back, scrutinizing Jack from head to toe. He's seen enough young punks to know there's always more than meets the eye. Surprisingly, his tone shifts to a more deliberate, almost polite note. VICTOR (weighing his words) I've got a proposition for you, Jack. Something tells me your skills could be useful in a... special case we've been working on. Jack's bad boy attitude flickers into a look of intrigue. This is unexpected—a cop, offering an olive branch in the form of a deal? His chains rattle softly as he leans forward, an eyebrow arched in curiosity. JACK (raising an eyebrow) You wanna make a deal with the devil? What's in it for me? Victor folds his arms, the barest hint of a smile appearing on his stern face. He knows he's made the right play. VICTOR (helpfully) Your freedom, for one. Help us catch a bigger fish, and I'll see what I can do about your current... accommodations. And who knows—he maybe even throw in a word towards getting your 'time capsule' back. Jack's smirk grows wider; the gears in his head are already turning. He knows the streets and the game, and now he's been given an unexpected chance to turn the tables. JACK (slyly) Alright, Detective Victor. I'll bite. What's the catch? Victor unfolds a map and lays it out on the table, pointing to several marked locations. He leans in, capturing Jack's gaze with an unwavering stare. VICTOR (sincerely) No catch—just drive. And Jack... Victor pauses, ensuring that his next words land with gravity. VICTOR (seriously) Don't make me regret this. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write the scene where Victor introduces Jack to his colleague, Ethan. Ethan has greased back black hair and brown eyes. He is dressed in a black leather coat, white shirt and a leopard-patterned tie. He has a strict and casual attitude. He is casually has his legs propped up on the desk and reading a magazine about guns. He knows nothing about Jack. While Jack leaves Ethan's office a few minutes later. Victor and Ethan chat about their guns with Ethan complaining about his M92FS and how much he wants a 1911.","output":"INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY The camera pans across an organized chaos of desks and computers, uniformed officers moving about with purpose. VICTOR strides confidently through the commotion, leading JACK, still in his varsity jacket but sans handcuffs, through the bullpen. They stop in front of a slightly ajar office door. Victor knocks briskly and pushes the door open. The scene reveals ETHAN, aloof and self-assured, with black hair slicked back as if he stepped out of a noir film. He doesn’t bother looking up from his magazine, a periodical dense with articles about firearms. ETHAN (entirely nonchalant) Come in, shut the door. State your business. VICTOR This is Jack. He’s going to be helping us out on the case. Ethan finally looks up, placing the magazine down as he takes in Jack's appearance. He gives a nod of acknowledgment but doesn't extend a hand. Instead, his brown eyes offer a terse assessment. ETHAN (measuring Jack up) Is that so? Hope he knows what he's getting into. JACK (with a cool grin) More than you might think. Victor gestures for Jack to take a seat, but Ethan shakes his head, indicating that it won't be necessary. Jack's presence in the room draws a question from Ethan's posture, still laid back with his legs on the desk. ETHAN (strict yet casual) So what's this guy's specialty? He doesn't look like the usual snitch. VICTOR He’s a driver. The kind of wheelman that can make a car dance. That’s not something you find on a resume. Ethan finally drops his legs from the desk and leans forward with a renewed interest. ETHAN (smirking) Dance, huh? Alright. We’ll see if you’ve got the right moves. A beat passes. Ethan’s smirk fades as he glances back at Victor, and Jack senses the cue to leave. He gives a subtle nod, turns, and exits the room. INT. ETHAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The moment Jack’s out, Ethan stands, his demeanor switching from casual to critically analytical. ETHAN So what’s his deal? You really think he can handle police work? VICTOR He’s got potential. And we can use every edge we can get. Ethan, now fully engaged, begins to rummage through one of the drawers in his desk. He pulls out his M92FS, handling it with a practiced familiarity. ETHAN (griping) Speaking of edges, I need a new sidearm. This M92FS—a great piece, but damn if it isn't finicky. Victor leans against a file cabinet, his arms crossed as he entertains the discussion. VICTOR (mildly amused) What are you pining for now? A 1911? ETHAN (frustrated) Yeah. It's a classic. Reliable. None of this over-engineered nonsense. Keep it simple, you know? Victor chuckles as he watches Ethan clean and check his M92FS with meticulous attention, despite his complaints. VICTOR (teasing) Well, if we close this case thanks to our new friend, maybe there'll be a bonus in it for you to get that 1911. ETHAN (raising an eyebrow) We better. I've got my eye on a custom shop piece. Jack better be worth the trouble. A silent acknowledgement passes between the two, Victor’s confidence clashing with Ethan's skepticism, a battle won only by time and results.

POLICE DEPARTMENT BREAK ROOM - DAY Jack pushes open the break room door to find a cheerful oasis in the midst of the department's hectic pace. CHRIS, the embodiment of youthful optimism, is sprawled comfortably on a battered sofa. His short brown hair is a disheveled mess, glasses perched on his nose as he focuses intently on the television screen, where an animated show plays, full of vibrant explosions and heroic dialogue. JACK (trying to sound nonchalant) Hey, Chris. Chris' head snaps up, his glasses catching the fluorescent light, and a grin quickly spreads across his face. He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking the remote off the table in his haste. CHRIS (energetically) Jack! What are you doing here? I mean, I thought you were... out. JACK (amused) I am. Sort of. It's a work release thing. Chris leans forward, the profound curiosity of a rookie cop mixed with brotherly concern shining through his expression. CHRIS (concerned) Are you okay? They’re not giving you a hard time, are they? JACK (shrugging it off) I can handle it. Come on, let’s walk. I've got to head out. Chris nods eagerly, and his demeanor shifts to one of support as he starts to walk alongside Jack. INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS As they walk through the corridor together, the contrast between them is striking: Jack's rebellious coolness is a counterpoint to Chris' by-the-book enthusiasm. CHRIS (optimistically) So they're letting you use your driving skills for good, huh? That’s kind of awesome! JACK (light-hearted) Well, \\"for good\\" is a stretch. But it beats sitting in a cell. CHRIS (leaning in conspiratorially) And what about Ethan and Victor? I hear they’re the best. It's got to be exciting working with them. JACK (playing it cool) They know their stuff, I'll give them that. But let's just say, I'm not here to make friends. They reach the entrance of the station, and the daylight streams in, casting long shadows on the floor. Jack turns to face Chris, a softer expression in his eyes. JACK (earnestly) Hey, kiddo. Keep your head down, alright? This place can change you if you let it. CHRIS (nods with determination) I know, Jack. And I’m glad you’re back... even if it’s just for a while. JACK (ruffles Chris’ hair) Stay out of trouble, you hear? CHRIS (grinning) No promises, big bro. They exchange a quick, meaningful look before Jack heads out the door, blending into the bustle of the city, leaving Chris to return to the sheltered confines of the break room and the watchful eyes of the department.

However, if you're looking to add some flair and improve the design a bit further, consider the following suggestions: 1. **Custom Colors and Branding**: Adjust the color scheme to fit your branding. Instead of using the default 'bg-dark', you could use your brand colors. 2. **Increased Visibility of Active Link**: Enhance the visibility of the active page link by changing its style more prominently than just the 'active' class. 3. **Improved Spacing and Padding**: Adjusting the spacing and padding can make your navbar look more balanced and less cramped. 4. **Custom Fonts and Typography**: Integrating custom fonts can add personality and improve readability. 5. **Hover and Animation Effects**: Subtle hover effects and transitions on the dropdowns or links can make the interaction more engaging. 6. **Consistent Case and Spacing for Text**: Consider whether you want all caps, title case, or lowercase for your link texts, and maintain that consistently. 7. **Stylized Search Bar**: A custom design for the search bar that fits your site's aesthetics could be more appealing than the default style.

It's enlightening to learn about the origins of the compensation funds connected with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ghana and the United Nations. The procedure for releasing the funds bit by bit using Ria control numbers seems well thought out, considering the complexities mentioned. The sum of €1,000,000 is quite substantial, and I am more than willing to cooperate to ensure a smooth transaction. I understand the need for an activation fee to facilitate this process and am ready to comply with the requirements. The anti-money laundering and drug certificate are sensible precautions, and I thank you for prioritizing the security and legality of this transaction. I will prepare the 550 activation fee in Bitcoin. However, I must admit that I'm not overly familiar with Bitcoin transactions. To ensure I complete this correctly, would it be possible for you to guide me through the process? I would hate to make an error that could delay the activation of the funds. Additionally, I will need a little extra time to set up a Bitcoin wallet and purchase the necessary Bitcoin for the payment. Would it be acceptable if I notified you before sending the Bitcoin to confirm that I'm doing everything correctly? Regarding the requested copy of my ID, I will send it within the next 24 hours.

It can handle the connection creation and reuse the connection if it’s already available. Here’s how you might structure such a service: 1. MongoDBConnection.js: A module responsible for managing the MongoDB client connection, ensuring that only one connection is used. Create a MongoDB service file that manages your client connection: // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require(‘mongodb’); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.db = null; this.client = null; } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.db) { console.log(“Using existing database connection”); return this.db; } else { try { this.client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); this.db = this.client.db(dbName); console.log(“MongoDB connection established”); return this.db; } catch (error) { console.error(“Could not connect to MongoDB”, error); throw new Error(“Failed to connect to MongoDB”); } } } close() { if (this.client) { this.client.close(); this.client = null; this.db = null; console.log(“MongoDB connection closed”); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); // Usage: // const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); // const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(‘yourMongoUriHere’, ‘yourDatabaseNameHere’); Here is how you can employ this module in parts of your application: // SomeServiceFile.js const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); (async () => { try { const db = await mongoDBConnection.connect(‘your_mongo_uri’, ‘your_database_name’); // you can use db in this file } catch (error) { console.error(“Error using MongoDB”, error); } })(); When you’re done with the application, or when you need to close the connection (like before the application exits), you call close: // At application shutdown const mongoDBConnection = require(‘./MongoDBConnection’); mongoDBConnection.close(); Using this structure, your MongoDB client is encapsulated in a single module (MongoDBConnection.js). Whenever a part of your application requires a database connection, it requests the connection through the module, which will either establish a new connection or reuse the existing one. This singleton pattern ensures that the connection is shared and not unnecessarily reopened, and is also closed appropriately when your application is done using it. It’s a robust and scalable solution that can manage your connection effectively across your application, and it’s suitable for use in a Node.js environment that runs on a single thread, such as a standard web server. But we may connect to multiple mongodb databses in the same application will this handle that scenario as well ?","output":"The code structure you've provided implements a singleton pattern for managing a MongoDB connection. With this design, you create and manage a single MongoDB client throughout the entire application. This pattern works well when your application only requires a connection to a single MongoDB database. However, if you need to connect to multiple MongoDB databases within the same application, the provided singleton pattern won't suffice, as it's designed to maintain a single instance of the connection. To handle multiple databases, you would need to modify your strategy. Instead of storing a single \`db\` instance, you would have to manage a map or an object that can store multiple database connections indexed by some form of a unique identifier (e.g., the database name). Here is how you might modify the MongoDBConnection class to handle multiple database connections: \`\`\`javascript // MongoDBConnection.js const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb'); class MongoDBConnection { constructor() { this.databases = {}; // Changed from a single db/client to a map } async connect(uri, dbName) { if (this.databases[dbName]) { console.log(\`Using existing database connection for {dbName}\`); return this.databases[dbName]; } else { try { const client = await MongoClient.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, }); const db = client.db(dbName); this.databases[dbName] = db; console.log(\`MongoDB connection for {dbName} established\`); return db; } catch (error) { console.error(\`Could not connect to MongoDB for {dbName}\`, error); throw new Error(\`Failed to connect to MongoDB for {dbName}\`); } } } close(dbName) { const db = this.databases[dbName]; if (db) { db.client.close(); delete this.databases[dbName]; console.log(\`MongoDB connection for {dbName} closed\`); } } // Close all connections closeAll() { for (const dbName in this.databases) { this.close(dbName); } } } // Export a singleton instance of MongoDBConnection module.exports = new MongoDBConnection(); \`\`\` Now, the \`MongoDBConnection\` class manages multiple databases. \`connect\` returns the connection for a specified database and creates it if it doesn't already exist. \`close\` now takes a \`dbName\` argument and closes the connection for that specific database. \`closeAll\` is added to close all database connections when the application shuts down. \`\`\`javascript // Usage example for multiple databases const mongoDBConnection = require('./MongoDBConnection'); (async () => { try { const dbOne = await mongoDBConnection.connect('your_mongo_uri', 'your_database_name_one'); // Use dbOne... const dbTwo = await mongoDBConnection.connect('your_mongo_uri', 'your_database_name_two'); // Use dbTwo... // ... Later, when closing the application or when done using the databases mongoDBConnection.closeAll(); // Closes all connections } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Error using MongoDB\\", error); } })(); \`\`\` This revised version accommodates multiple database connections by storing them as properties of the \`databases\` object, using database names as the keys. This allows the application to dynamically manage connections to different databases."},{"instruction":"which is good ? mongoose and mongoclient","output":"The choice between Mongoose and the native MongoDB client (\`MongoClient\`) in a Node.js application largely depends on the requirements of your project and your personal preferences. Both have their pros and cons. Here's a comparison to help you decide: # Mongoose: - **Object Data Modeling (ODM):** Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher level of abstraction and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks, and more. - **Schema Validation:** Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your collections. This can ensure data integrity by enforcing a structure on your documents and providing automatic type conversion. - **Middleware (Hooks):** Mongoose provides middleware (also called pre and post hooks) that you can use to perform operations before or after certain database operations, such as saving a document. - **Population:** A powerful feature of Mongoose is the ability to automatically replace specified paths within the document with documents from other collections (similar to SQL joins). - **Active Record Style ORMs:** Mongoose follows the active record pattern, providing methods on the instance of the model itself for saving, querying, and other database operations. # MongoClient: - **Minimal Abstraction:** The native MongoDB client provides a minimal layer over the raw MongoDB commands. It is suitable for those who prefer to work closer to the metal and might require finer control over database operations. - **Performance:** Direct use of the MongoClient is typically faster than Mongoose since there's no overhead of schema validation, instance methods, or middleware. - **Flexibility:** As it doesn't involve schema enforcement, you have greater flexibility in terms of how you structure your documents. It can be useful for databases with highly dynamic schemas or when working with many different collections or databases. - **Simplicity:** For smaller projects or when a schema isn't necessary, using \`MongoClient\` can be simpler and more straightforward. # When to Use Which: - **Use Mongoose when:** - You need schema validation and want to define a clear structure for your data. - You want to use middleware for complex operations before or after you save a document. - You're building a large-scale application that benefits from an active record pattern. - You need features such as population and want tighter integration with your Node.js application through models. - **Use MongoClient when:** - You're dealing with a schema-less database or your data structure frequently changes. - You want maximum performance and you're handling optimization on your own. - You are comfortable writing raw MongoDB queries and don't need an abstraction layer. Ultimately, the \\"best\\" option is subjective and is based on the specific needs and constraints of your project, your team's familiarity with MongoDB and ODMs, and your preference for writing database queries and handling data. If you value structure and schema definition highly, Mongoose could be the way to go. On the other hand, if you prefer a lightweight, flexible approach and don't mind managing data integrity at the application level, \`MongoClient\` may be more appropriate."},{"instruction":"is this robust and generic enough ? const mongoose = require('mongoose'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; } async connect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { console.log(\`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}\`); return this.connections[uri]; } try { this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }); console.log(\`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}\`); return this.connections[uri]; } catch (error) { console.error(\`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}\`); throw error; } } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(\`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}\`); } } async closeAllConnections() { for (const uri in this.connections) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === 1) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(\`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}\`); } } } } module.exports = new MongoDBService();","output":"Your \`MongoDBService\` class using Mongoose is a good starting point for managing multiple MongoDB connections in a Node.js application. It appears generic enough to handle connections to different URIs and provides methods to connect, disconnect, and close all connections. However, there are a few things you might consider to improve the robustness of the service: 1. **Connection Configurations:** - You may want to parameterize the connection options and make them configurable when creating connections, rather than hard-coding them within the \`connect\` method. 2. **Error Handling:** - It's good to have error handling within the \`connect\` method, but you might also want to consider how to handle disconnection errors in the \`disconnect\` and \`closeAllConnections\` methods. 3. **Connection States:** - You are currently checking for \`readyState\` of \`1\` to determine if the connection is active, which is correct. However, for robustness and readability, you might want to consider using \`mongoose\` connection states constants (e.g., \`mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected\`) instead of magic numbers. 4. **Singleton Pattern:** - You are exporting an instance of \`MongoDBService\`, which ensures a single instance (singleton) throughout your application. This is generally a good practice when consistent state management is required. 5. **Asynchronous Connection Initialization:** - If multiple parts of your application try to establish a connection to the same URI at the same time, the current design might create multiple connections to the same database. This could be prevented by implementing a connection-locking mechanism or by checking if a connection attempt is already in progress and awaiting its completion. 6. **Graceful Shutdown:** - Consider creating a method to handle application termination or signals for a graceful shutdown, where all Mongo connections are closed cleanly. Here's how you might update your code to address some of these points: \`\`\`javascript const mongoose = require('mongoose'); class MongoDBService { constructor() { this.connections = {}; this.connectionOptions = { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }; this.connectingURIs = {}; // To store URIs that are currently connecting } async connect(uri, options = {}) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { console.log(\`Using existing Mongoose connection for {uri}\`); } else if (!this.connectingURIs[uri]) { this.connectingURIs[uri] = true; try { const connectionOptions = { ...this.connectionOptions, ...options }; this.connections[uri] = await mongoose.createConnection(uri, connectionOptions); console.log(\`Created new Mongoose connection for {uri}\`); } catch (error) { console.error(\`Failed to connect to MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}\`); throw error; } finally { delete this.connectingURIs[uri]; } } else { console.log(\`Connection attempt already in progress for {uri}\`); // Keep retrying or waiting until the connection either succeeds or fails await this.waitForConnection(uri); } return this.connections[uri]; } async waitForConnection(uri) { // Implement logic to wait until the current connection attempt resolves } async disconnect(uri) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { await this.connections[uri].close(); console.log(\`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}\`); } } async closeAllConnections() { for (const uri in this.connections) { await this.disconnect(uri); // Use the disconnect method to ensure proper handling } } } module.exports = new MongoDBService(); \`\`\` Keep in mind that the function \`waitForConnection\` must be implemented to manage the synchronization of connections properly.

You addressed the default options to be provided and allowed for overriding them, which adds the flexibility needed for different use cases. Here are some additional minor enhancements you might still consider: 1. **Connection Error Handling:** - When a connection attempt fails, and an error is thrown, ensure that subsequent retries can proceed by removing or resetting the failed connection entry in the \`this.connections\` object. 2. **Disconnect Error Handling:** - Currently, if a disconnection fails, it throws an error. In some cases, you might want the application to continue the shutdown process even if some disconnects fail. Consider whether to throw an error or just log the error and continue the shutdown. 3. **Graceful Shutdown Integration:** - Consider integrating the shutdown process with Node.js events like \`process.on('SIGINT', ...)\` to automatically close all connections when the process is terminated. 4. **Validation & Input Sanitization:** - Validate that the URI is in the correct format and sanitize input where necessary to prevent potential issues. 5. **Additional Logging and Monitoring:** - Adding more detailed logging (like timestamps or identifying which part of your application a log is coming from) can be helpful. Consider using a more sophisticated logging library if your application is likely to scale. 6. **Promises and Asynchronous Management:** - When closing all connections in \`closeAllConnections\`, currently each connection is closed sequentially, which is fine. If you're looking for more efficiency, you can close them in parallel using \`Promise.all()\`. Here's a small modification using \`Promise.all()\` for \`closeAllConnections\`: \`\`\`javascript async closeAllConnections() { const closingPromises = []; for (const uri in this.connections) { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { closingPromises.push( this.connections[uri].close().catch(error => { console.error(\`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}\`); // Depending on your requirements, you might handle this error differently }) ); } } await Promise.all(closingPromises); console.log(\`All Mongoose connections have been disconnected.\`); } \`\`\` By using \`Promise.all()\`, you're attempting to close all connections in parallel, making the shutdown process potentially faster, especially if there are multiple connections to close. Just make sure that parallel disconnections don't cause issues in your specific environment. Lastly, always be cautious with any singletons (as \`module.exports = new MongoDBService();\` will create a singleton), especially if you ever plan to use them in an environment that might not support the single-threaded singleton approach (like a serverless function that creates multiple instances). But as long as you are aware of the limitations and design your application accordingly, your current implementation of \`MongoDBService\` should serve you well."},{"instruction":"hows this now ?","output":"Your \`MongoDBService\` implementation has improved over the iterations, with the incorporation of asynchronous connection management, allowing for connection options, error handling, and closing all connections in a more efficient or parallel manner. It is important to note that while \`Promise.all()\` will execute all the promises in parallel, if any of them reject, \`Promise.all()\` will throw an error immediately. If you can tolerate individual disconnections failing, but still want to close all connections, you could use \`Promise.allSettled()\` instead. \`Promise.allSettled()\` resolves with an array of objects, each indicating the outcome of each promise, regardless of whether they were fulfilled or rejected, thus making sure that all disconnection attempts are made. Here's how you can modify the \`closeAllConnections\` function: \`\`\`javascript async closeAllConnections() { const closingPromises = Object.keys(this.connections).map(uri => { if (this.connections[uri] && this.connections[uri].readyState === mongoose.Connection.STATES.connected) { return this.connections[uri].close().then(() => { console.log(\`Disconnected from Mongoose at {uri}\`); }).catch(error => { console.error(\`Failed to disconnect from MongoDB at {uri}: {error.message}\`); // Handle individual errors, consider recording the error in a log or escalating it }); } return Promise.resolve(); // If nothing to close, resolve immediately }); await Promise.allSettled(closingPromises); console.log(\`All disconnection attempts have been made.\`); } \`\`\` This revision with \`Promise.allSettled()\` ensures that you attempt to close all the connections and then handle the results accordingly, which is generally what you'd want during a graceful shutdown process.

Here's a review of your final MongoDBService class and \`SIGINT\` handling: 1. **Handles failed connection attempts:** The class now deletes failed connection attempts, which allows retries to proceed without being hindered by the previous failed state. 2. **Parallel disconnection:** The \`closeAllConnections\` method will now initiate the disconnection of all databases in parallel using \`Promise.all()\`, which can reduce the time required during a graceful shutdown. 3. **Signal handling for graceful shutdown:** This includes proper handling for \`SIGINT\`, which is a signal that the process will receive, for example, when you hit Ctrl+C on the terminal. It's a common place to hook into to start cleanup processes like closing database connections. One consideration for the \`disconnect\` and \`closeAllConnections\` methods is to remove the connection from the \`this.connections\` object after a successful disconnection.

This is critical for avoiding abrupt disconnections and potential data corruption. Here are a few additional considerations for further refinement: - **Connection Validation:** The URI provided should be validated to ensure it's in a correct format, preventing unnecessary connection attempts that will fail and could throw exceptions. - **Concurrency Control:** If \`connect\` is called for the same URI concurrently before an established connection is added to \`this.connections\`, you could end up with multiple connections. You might consider introducing connection initialization locking logic (using a temporary \\"connecting\\" state) to account for this. - **Error Handling Strategy:** Consider your strategy for connection/disconnection failures. Depending on your application context, you might choose to continue operation with reduced functionality, escalate errors more aggressively, or shut down the service completely in the case of certain errors. - **Logging and Monitoring:** If your application scales, it will benefit from a more sophisticated logging strategy, potentially integrating with centralized logging or monitoring services to help track and alert on connection issues. - **Testing:** Ensure that this service is thoroughly tested, particularly with regards to how it manages concurrent connections and disconnections. Simulate failures and assess how it recovers from different scenarios. Your class now looks well-structured and is equipped to manage MongoDB connections effectively. Keep in mind that building and nurturing a codebase is an iterative process. Pay attention to issues as they arise, and continue to iterate on your design as needed. Good logging, monitoring, and an operational playbook will help you maintain a robust service in production."},{"instruction":"how to use this in my start file THis is my existing start file require(\\"dotenv\\").config(); const express = require(\\"express\\"); const mongoose = require(\\"mongoose\\"); const bodyParser = require(\\"body-parser\\"); const _ = require(\\"lodash\\"); const path = require(\\"path\\"); const configurations = require(\\"./config.json\\"); const createLogger = require('./services/Logger'); const logger = createLogger('MedicsCommunicationServer'); const options = { lockFileName: 'medics-communication-server.lock', killTimeout: 10000, // Set the timeout for waiting before terminating previous instance (in ms) if its already running. waitForExitTimeout: 20000, // Set the timeout for waiting for the old process to exit (milliseconds) checkInterval: 500, // Set the interval for checking the status of the other process (milliseconds) maxRetries: 3, // Set the maximum number of retries for acquiring the lock defaultAnswer: 'yes' // Set the default answer for user prompts } const LockManager = require('node-locksmith'); const lockManager = new LockManager(options); // Initializes termination event handlers for graceful application shutdown. lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers(); const Logger = require('./services/Logger'); // Create the application const app = express(); // Setup body parser app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: \\"50mb\\" })); app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: \\"50mb\\", extended: true, parameterLimit: 50000 })); // Setup CORS app.use(function (req, res, next) { Logger.info('Processing ....

The class you've created manages connections in a way that allows for better control and error handling. Here's how you can use your \`MongoDBService\` in your existing start file: 1. Required your \`MongoDBService\`: \`\`\`javascript const mongoDBService = require('./path/to/MongoDBService'); \`\`\` 2. Replace \`mongoose.connect\` and connection event handlers with a call to \`mongoDBService.connect\`. You'll want to make sure to place it in an asynchronous context since \`connect\` is an async function: \`\`\`javascript async function startServer() { try { // Connect to MongoDB using MongoDBService await mongoDBService.connect(configurations.mongodbURL); Logger.info(\\"Connected to Mongo DB\\"); app.models = require(\\"./models/index\\"); // ... rest of your existing code to set up routes and listen on port ... } catch (error) { Logger.error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB:\\", error); // Handle connection errors here potentially by terminating the process or a retry mechanism } } startServer(); \`\`\` 3. Modify the mongoose connection error handler if needed, since you have already included error handling in the \`MongoDBService\`. The error handling in \`startServer\` captures issues that may arise during the async connection setup. 4. You would want to handle the application exit and ensure the MongoDB connections are closed properly. This is typically done through process event listeners for \`SIGINT\` and \`SIGTERM\`, which you've already set up in the \`MongoDBService\` module, so this is now taken care of. Following the above steps, your start file should look something like this after integration: \`\`\`javascript require(\\"dotenv\\").config(); const express = require(\\"express\\"); const bodyParser = require(\\"body-parser\\"); const _ = require(\\"lodash\\"); const path = require(\\"path\\"); const configurations = require(\\"./config.json\\"); const Logger = require('./services/Logger'); const mongoDBService = require('./path/to/MongoDBService'); // Path to your MongoDBService // Create the application const app = express(); // ... rest of your middleware setup ... // Replaces mongoose.connect async function startServer() { try { // Connect to MongoDB using MongoDBService instead of mongoose directly await mongoDBService.connect(configurations.mongodbURL); Logger.info(\\"Connected to MongoDB\\"); app.models = require(\\"./models/index\\"); // ... rest of your code to set up routes ... let httpPort = configurations.serverPort; app.listen(httpPort, function () { Logger.info(\`Listening on port {httpPort} ...\`); }); } catch (error) { Logger.error(\\"Failed to connect to MongoDB:\\", error); // Terminate the process or implement a retry mechanism process.exit(1); } } startServer(); \`\`\` Make sure you're managing the asynchronous nature of these operations correctly and that any error handling or retry logic is appropriate for your application's needs. Test extensively to ensure that connections are established and handled as expected in both normal and failover scenarios."},{"instruction":"خمسة أهداف تعليمية لمساق جامعي حول علم النفس التربوي؟","output":"1. فهم العمليات النفسية وكيف تؤثر في العملية التعليمية: يهدف هذا الهدف إلى تمكين الطلاب من فهم العمليات النفسية المختلفة التي يمر بها الطلاب خلال عملية التعلم، مثل التعلم والذاكرة والانتباه والمشاعر والعزم. سيتعلم الطلاب كيف يمكن لهذه العمليات أن تؤثر في التعليم وكيف يمكن للمعلمين الاستفادة منها في تصميم الدروس وتقديم المساعدة الفردية. 2. التعرف على نظريات التعلم وتطبيقاتها في البيئة التعليمية: سيتعرف الطلاب على مجموعة متنوعة من النظريات المرتبطة بعلم النفس التربوي، مثل التعلم الاجتماعي والبنائي والتعلم التعاوني. سيتعلم الطلاب كيف يمكن تطبيق هذه النظريات في البيئة التعليمية، مثل تصميم الدروس وإدارة الفصل وتعزيز التعلم النشط والتفاعل بين الطلاب. 3. فهم احتياجات الطلاب المختلفة وتصميم برامج تعليمية ملائمة: سيتعلم الطلاب كيفية تقييم احتياجات الطلاب المختلفة، مثل الطلاب ذوي صعوبات التعلم أو الطلاب الموهوبين أو الطلاب ذوي احتياجات خاصة. سيصمم الطلاب برامج تعليمية ملائمة لهذه الاحتياجات، مع التركيز على إنشاء بيئات تعليمية شاملة وداعمة. 4. تطوير مهارات التواصل والتفاعل مع الطلاب: سيتدرب الطلاب على تطوير مهارات التواصل والتفاعل مع الطلاب، بما في ذلك القدرة على الاستماع بفعالية وإدارة الصف ومعالجة التحديات التي يواجهها الطلاب في البيئة التعليمية. سيتعلم الطلاب كيف يمكن إقامة علاقة ثقة مع الطلاب وتعزيز الانضباط والمشاركة الفعالة. 5. تقييم الأداء التعليمي وتحليل البيانات: سيتعلم الطلاب كيفية تقييم الأداء التعليمي باستخدام أدوات التقييم المختلفة، مثل الاختبارات والأوراق العملية والمشاريع. سيتعلم الطلاب كيفية تحليل البيانات المستمدة من هذه التقييمات واستخدام البيانات لتحديد نقاط القوة والضعف في العملية التعليمية واتخاذ القرارات المستنيرة المتعلقة بالتعليم."},{"instruction":"As a restaurant owner, write a professional email to the supplier to get these products every week: - Wine (x10) - Eggs (x24) - Bread (x12)","output":"Subject: Weekly Standing Order for Restaurant Supplies Dear [Supplier's Name], I hope this email finds you well.

Let's begin with the contract's functions and events. What are the key operations too find the vulnerabilities ini the contract","output":"When analyzing a smart contract to find potential vulnerabilities, it's important to go over each function, event, and modifier to understand their behavior and interactions. The key operations in the \`UbiquityDollarToken\` contract include: 1. \`initialize(address _manager)\`: Initializes the contract with the sender's address as the Ubiquity Manager. 2. \`setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive)\`: Sets an incentive contract for a given account. 3. \`_checkAndApplyIncentives(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\`: Applies incentives based on the sender, recipient, and operator (transaction initiator) if applicable. 4. \`_transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\`: Overrides the ERC20 \`_transfer\` function to transfer tokens and apply incentives. 5. \`burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)\`: Burns tokens from a specified account. 6. \`mint(address to, uint256 amount)\`: Mints tokens to a specified address. 7. \`_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)\`: Allows an admin to set a new implementation contract. 8. Modifiers like \`onlyDollarMinter\`, \`onlyDollarBurner\`, and Ethereum/OpenZeppelin's lifecycle ones such as \`whenNotPaused\` and \`initializer\`. 9. Events like \`IncentiveContractUpdate\`, \`Burning\`, and \`Minting\` that emit logs for certain state changes. Looking for vulnerabilities, these are the areas to inspect: - Access Control: Ensure that only authorized parties can call functions with privileged access. Look for proper use of modifiers and roles. - Reentrancy: Look for reentrancy risks where external calls can potentially be exploited to manipulate contract state or cause unexpected behavior. - Proper initialization: Check if \`initialize\` can only be called once and cannot be misused. - Upgrade Mechanism: Examine the upgrade process to ensure it is secure and doesn't introduce risks of unauthorized access or misuse. - Incentive Logic: Evaluate the logic in \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` to prevent any manipulation or unfair advantage. - Incentive Contract Trust: Since incentives require trust in external contracts (\`IIncentive\`), verify that the system is resilient to malicious contracts. - Token Burning and Minting: These functions manipulate token supply and should be scrutinized for proper access control and checks. - State Variable Manipulation: Check for manipulation risks in state variables (e.g., \`incentiveContract\` mapping). - Events: Ensure that events provide accurate information and are emitted in all relevant functions for transparency. Without a more in-depth audit and without having the complete code of all the imported contracts and interfaces (like \`ERC20Ubiquity\`, \`IERC20Ubiquity\`, \`IIncentive\`, and all the functions from OpenZeppelin that are inherited but not directly written in the given contract), it's not possible to give a full review or identify all potential vulnerabilities.

It calls an internal function \`__ERC20Ubiquity_init\` with the manager address, token name \\"Ubiquity Dollar,\\" and token symbol \\"uAD\\". The \`initializer\` modifier ensures this function can be called only once. 2. \`setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive)\`: This function sets an incentive contract for a specified account. The requirement ensures that only a user with the \`GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE\` can call the function. It emits an \`IncentiveContractUpdate\` event upon successful update. 3. \`_checkAndApplyIncentives(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\`: This internal function applies incentives on token transfers. It checks the sender, recipient, and operator (transaction initiator), and calls the \`incentivize\` method on any relevant incentive contract. 4. \`_transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\`: This override of the \`_transfer\` function from the ERC20 parent contract includes the application of incentives through \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\`. It first calls the regular token transfer logic (\`super._transfer\`) before applying any incentives. 5. \`burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)\`: This function allows the burning of tokens from a specified address. The \`onlyDollarBurner\` modifier restricts its usage to only users with the \\"Dollar burner\\" role. It pauses the functionality if the contract is paused and emits a \`Burning\` event. 6. \`mint(address to, uint256 amount)\`: This function allows the minting of new tokens. It requires the caller to have the \\"Dollar minter\\" role enforced by the \`onlyDollarMinter\` modifier; the \`whenNotPaused\` modifier stops minting if the contract is paused. It emits a \`Minting\` event upon minting new tokens. 7. \`_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)\`: This internal function stub indicates permission for an upgrade to a new contract implementation but does not include actual implementation details. It references \`onlyAdmin\`, which suggests some form of access control, but the actual modifier is not defined in the provided code. Events and Modifiers: - Two custom events are defined: \`IncentiveContractUpdate\` for logging incentive contract updates and \`Burning\` for logging burning of tokens. The \`Minting\` event is mentioned, but its declaration isn't provided in the code (assumed to be part of the inherited ERC20 contract). - Two modifiers are defined: \`onlyDollarMinter\` and \`onlyDollarBurner\` for access control on the minting and burning functions, respectively. The reference to \`whenNotPaused\` suggests that there is a pause capability inherited from an OpenZeppelin contract or similar, which wasn't provided in the code. - Presence of \`initializer\` modifier suggests it uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts framework to ensure \`initialize\` can only be invoked once as part of contract initialization. Overall, the relationships and descriptions provided in the question seem to accurately represent the functionality within the provided smart contract code. However, without seeing the implementations of inherited contracts and constants (like the actual roles and \`whenNotPaused\`), a full audit is not possible. To conduct a further review and identify potential vulnerabilities, auditors would need access to the complete code, including inherited contracts, interfaces, and libraries. They would also need to deploy and interact with the contract on a test network, perform static analysis, and write comprehensive tests to cover all possible scenarios and interactions."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message is empty.

Here's a review of the various components and setup within the file: ***Environment Configuration:*** - It starts by requiring \`dotenv\` for loading environment variables from a \`.env\` file - this is good practice for keeping sensitive information out of the codebase. ***Module Imports:*** - Common modules are being imported like \`express\`, \`body-parser\`, \`lodash\`, \`path\`, \`helmet\` which are standard for an Express.js application. - \`helmet\` being included for enhancing security is a great inclusion. - Custom services like \`Logger\` and \`MongodbService\` are being imported, indicating that the app separates concerns by having different files manage different functionalities. - \`lockManager\` (from \`node-locksmith\`) is being used to prevent multiple instances of this service from running simultaneously, which can be important depending on the use case of the application. ***Body Parsing Middleware:*** - The file setup includes \`body-parser\` to parse JSON and URL-encoded payloads with a high-size limit (\`50mb\`) that should be reviewed against your application's needs. This may present a risk if the application will process a lot of large requests, both from a performance and security perspective (e.g., potential for denial-of-service attacks). ***CORS Middleware:*** - CORS is set up to allow all origins (\`*\`), which could be insecure depending on the deployment environment; it's advisable to explicitly specify which domains can access your application. ***Static Files:*** - The application serves static files from a \`public\` directory; paths are being set up redundantly with \`app.use(express.static('public'));\` and \`app.use('/public', express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, 'public')));\`. One of these entries seems unnecessary and might be a remnant of refactoring. ***Database:*** - There's a database connection setup for MongoDB, and it exits the application if the initial connection fails. This is a fairly common practice for ensuring that an application does not run in a partially broken state. ***Routes:*** - Routes are dynamically loaded and associated with their controllers using Lodash, which suggests flexibility and a scalable project structure for routing. ***Error Handling:*** - There's centralized error handling that logs errors and responds with a generic message. This helps prevent leaking stack traces or other sensitive information. ***Server Configuration:*** - The server port is taken from the configuration file, which provides flexibility for different deployment environments. ***Initialization Function:*** - The \`initializeApp\` function is an asynchronous function that bootstraps the application. It is immediately invoked at the end of the file, and unhandled promise rejections are caught to log initialization failures. ***Suggestions for Improvement:*** 1. Update \`body-parser\` middleware usage: Express.js has built-in body parsing capabilities. You can replace \`body-parser\` with \`express.json()\` and \`express.urlencoded()\`. 2. Review payload size limits: 50MB might be too large depending on your intended use case. 3. Harden CORS settings: Be more specific about the allowed origins if possible. 4. Remove redundant static file serving paths. 5. Consider logging the error message in the \`initializeApp().catch()\` for more clarity about initialization failures. Overall, the file is well-structured and contains many of the necessary components and security configurations needed for a typical web service. However, there are some areas where you can improve or refine the setup based on security best practices and modern Express.js capabilities."},{"instruction":"can you do that show the file again","output":"Certainly!

Hibaüzenetek: Amikor a felhasználó hibát követ el a parancssorban vagy a fájlok kezelése közben, az ffmpeg az okot részletesen ismerteti a felhasználóval. Ezen üzenetek gyakran pirossal vagy más hangsúlyozó színekkel jelennek meg a könnyebb észlelhetőség érdekében. 2. Figyelmeztetések: Az ffmpeg figyelmeztethet a felhasználót bizonyos műveletek nem várt vagy nem támogatott hatásaira. Ezek az üzenetek általában sárgával vagy más figyelmeztető színekkel jelennek meg. 3. Információk: Az ffmpeg információkat is megjeleníthet a műveletekről, például a feldolgozás időtartamáról, a kimeneti fájl adatairól stb. Ezek az üzenetek általában normál vagy fehér színnel jelennek meg, a könnyebb olvashatóság érdekében. Az színek használata segít a felhasználónak gyorsan észlelni és megkülönböztetni az üzenetek tartalmát. Azonban mindig érdemes alaposan átolvasni az üzeneteket, hogy pontosan megértsük, mi történik az adott műveletek során."},{"instruction":"Ha világos és sima zöld szín az átméretezéssel kapcsolatban átalakítás során amikor a videó külömböző felfontásokat tartalmaz","output":"A világos és sima zöld szín jelzi, hogy az ffmpeg processzálás közben átméretezte a videotartalmat különböző felbontásokhoz. Ezek az üzenetek arra utalhatnak, hogy az ffmpeg sikeresen végrehajtotta az átméretezési műveletet, és elkészítette a különböző felbontású videófájlokat. Ez különösen hasznos lehet, ha például több felbontásra van szükség, például különböző készülékekhez vagy közösségi média platformokhoz. Az ffmpeg lehetőséget biztosít a videofájlok kiválasztására és az átméretezés szabályozására a parancssorból vagy szkriptből történő vezérléssel. A zöld szín használata jelzi, hogy az átméretezési művelet sikeresen megtörtént, és az új felbontású videofájlok elkészültek. A sima és világos árnyalatú zöld szín segíti az üzenetek könnyű észlelését és megkülönböztetését a többi típusú üzenettől az ffmpeg kimenetében."},{"instruction":"Miért csinálja az ffmpeg azt hogy ha a videó nem egyenletes felbontású és miért méretezi egyformára","output":"Az ffmpeg akkor hajtja végre az átméretezést, ha a videó nem egyenletes felbontású. Az egyenletes felbontású videó azonos pixelmérettel és képaránnyal rendelkezik az egész tartalom területén. Az átméretezés oka lehet, hogy az adott videót további feldolgozási lépésekre készítik elő, ahol az egyenletes felbontás előnyösebb lehet. Például, ha a videót tovább szeretnék konvertálni vagy össze akarják fűzni más videofájlokkal, az egyenletes felbontás könnyebben kezelhető és konzisztens kimenetet eredményez. Az átméretezés során a ffmpeg a változó méretű képeket vagy videofrámeket átalakítja és a kívánt felbontásra hozza. Ezért az eredeti nem egyenletes felbontású videó egységes képarányú és pixelméretű videóvá válik. Az ffmpeg lehetővé teszi, hogy a felhasználók specifikálják a kívánt felbontást, a képarányt és egyéb átméretezési paramétereket a videofájlok feldolgozásához."},{"instruction":"Az ffmpeg ennyire intelligens???","output":"Az ffmpeg egy nagyon erőteljes és sokoldalú multimédiás keretrendszer, amely számos feldolgozási funkcióval és lehetőséggel rendelkezik. Az ffmpeg képes a videó és audió feldolgozására, konverzióra, átméretezésre, kódolásra, dekódolásra és sok más műveletre. Bár az ffmpeg rendkívül hasznos és sokféle feladatot képes ellátni, nem rendelkezik \\"intelligenciával\\" a hagyományos értelemben. Ez azt jelenti, hogy az ffmpeg automatikusan végrehajtja a parancsokat és műveleteket a megadott paraméterek és beállítások szerint. Az ffmpeg tudása és képességei a használó választásaitól és specifikációitól függenek. A felhasználónak pontos utasításokat kell adnia, hogy az ffmpeg pontosan és a kívánt módon végezze el a kívánt műveleteket. Például, ha videó átméretezést szeretnénk végrehajtani az ffmpeg segítségével, meg kell adnunk a kívánt felbontást és további paramétereket a parancssorban. Ahhoz, hogy az ffmpeg pontosan és hatékonyan működjön, fontos megérteni a funkcióit, kódolási formátumokat, beállításokat és a bizonyos műveletekkel járó részleteket. A helyes használathoz általában szükség lehet az ffmpeg dokumentációjára és a használati útmutatóra."},{"instruction":"És ha a telefonon egy nagyon hosszú videót alakítok át az milyen hatással lesz az akkura","output":"Ha egy hosszú videót alakít át a telefonon az ffmpeg segítségével, az jelentős hatással lehet az akkumulátorra. Videókonverzió során az ffmpeg erőforrásigényes folyamat, amely magas CPU- és GPU-használatot eredményezhet. Az intenzív processzorhasználat és a nagy grafikus terhelés fogyasztja az akkumulátort. Ez azt jelenti, hogy hosszabb ideig tarthat a konverzió és ezáltal a telefon akkumulátorának merülése is gyorsabban történhet. Ezt különösen figyelembe kell venni, ha a telefon töltésénél alacsony az akkumulátor töltöttségi szintje. Emellett a hosszú videónak magasabb tárolóigénye lehet, ami további hatást gyakorolhat az akkumulátorra. Az adatok mozgatása, tárolása és feldolgozása több energiát igényel. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy az akkumulátor fogyasztását több tényező is befolyásolhatja, mint például a telefon hardverének minősége, az ffmpeg feldolgozási beállításai és a hálózati kapcsolat. Mindig érdemes figyelembe venni az akkumulátor töltöttségét és szükség esetén feltölteni vagy csatlakoztatni az eszközt egy töltőhöz, hogy elkerüljék a váratlan kikapcsolást közben a konverziós folyamat."},{"instruction":"so i review the contract LINE BY LINE // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

If the external contract is designed to recursively call back into the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract, it could lead to a reentrancy attack. This could potentially allow the attacker to drain funds or manipulate contract state before the initial transaction is completed. Are there any reentrancy guards in place for functions that interact with external contracts, specifically the \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` function?-issue 2Incorrect Access Controlhigh The \`setIncentiveContract\` function allows setting an incentive contract for any account. If the access control is not properly configured or if there is a bug in the access control implementation, unauthorized users could potentially set malicious incentive contracts. This could lead to unauthorized incentive logic being executed during token transfers, which could manipulate the contract's intended behavior or cause loss of funds. Has the access control logic been audited to ensure that only authorized roles can call the \`setIncentiveContract\` function? -issue 3 Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contractscritical The \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` function calls the \`incentivize\` method on potentially untrusted incentive contracts. If an attacker can set a malicious contract as an incentive contract, they could execute arbitrary code within the context of the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract. This could lead to unauthorized actions, such as token theft or disruption of contract functionality. Are there any mechanisms in place to ensure that only trusted contracts can be set as incentive contracts and called by the \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` function? -issue 4 Denial of Service via Incentive Contracthigh If a malicious or buggy incentive contract is set, it could fail and revert when the \`incentivize\` function is called, causing all transfers that trigger the incentive logic to fail. This could be used to lock funds and prevent legitimate operations, effectively causing a denial of service (DoS) for the token contract. What happens if an incentive contract reverts during the execution of the \`incentivize\` function? Is there a mechanism to prevent a denial of service in such a case?-issue 5 Unauthorized Upgrade Attackcritical The \`_authorizeUpgrade\` function allows the contract to be upgraded to a new implementation. If the access control for this function is not secure or if there is a way to bypass the intended access control, an attacker could potentially upgrade the contract to a malicious implementation. This could result in complete control over the contract and its funds by the attacker. How is the access control for the \`_authorizeUpgrade\` function enforced, and has it been audited for security vulnerabilities?","output":"When reviewing a Solidity contract for security vulnerabilities, it's important to understand how the contract functions, how access controls are implemented, and the context in which external contracts are interacted with. Here are considerations for each of the issues you've outlined: 1. **Reentrancy Attack**: The contract's \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` function does interact with external contracts, which is a vector for reentrancy attacks. The Solidity code you've provided does not show a reentrancy guard (like the \`nonReentrant\` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard library). Without such a guard, the concern about reentrancy is valid. This risk should be mitigated by implementing reentrancy protection mechanisms. 2. **Incorrect Access Control**: The \`setIncentiveContract\` function is protected by a \`require\` statement that checks if the caller has the \`GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE\`. This should ensure that only users with this role can call the function. However, this assumes the role management system within the \`accessControl\` contract is secure and correctly implemented. If these assumptions hold, and there are no other bugs or backdoors, then access control is likely correctly managed. An audit should confirm the correctness and integrity of the role management system. 3. **Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts**: The issue raised is valid since \`incentivize\` is called on contracts that might be untrusted. There is no evident code here to check that the called contracts are trustworthy before interaction occurs. One way to reduce this risk is to whitelist known, audited incentive contracts and disallow arbitrary addresses being used. 4. **Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts**: If an \`incentivize\` call fails, it will revert the transaction, leading to a potential DoS condition. To prevent this, the Ubiquity Dollar Token contract could implement a try-catch mechanism around the \`incentivize\` calls, allowing the rest of the transaction to succeed even if the incentive mechanism fails. This is not present in the provided code snippet. 5. **Unauthorized Upgrade Attack**: The \`_authorizeUpgrade\` function is intended as an internal function meant to be used only by the proxy admin when the contract is deployed as an upgradable contract (usually through a proxy pattern like OpenZeppelin's \`TransparentUpgradeableProxy\`). However, without the full view of the upgradeability infrastructure and relevant access control implementation, it's impossible to evaluate the exact risk. This function should be accessible only to a highly privileged role (such as an admin), and this role should be protected with multi-signature wallets and/or timelocks to prevent unauthorized upgrades. Each of these issues is a legitimate concern and warrants thorough review and testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and a comprehensive audit by professional auditors specialising in smart contract security. If any part of the access control system or incentive mechanism is not secure, the risks you've highlighted could indeed be exploited."},{"instruction":"prove they are valid or invalid with evidence","output":"To prove the validity or invalidity of the security concerns you listed, one would typically need to inspect the code in its entirety, look for further assurances within the code itself or in its deployment context, and review the findings of professional security audits. Since I can only review the given code snippet, I will analyze each concern and provide explanations based on the provided code and standard Solidity/security practices. 1. **Reentrancy Attack**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: There are no apparent reentrancy guards, such as OpenZeppelin's \`nonReentrant\` modifier, in the code snippet provided. The \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` function calls external contracts, which is a typical reentrancy attack vector. - **Proving Validity**: To prove this vulnerability is valid, one would need to demonstrate a scenario where reentrancy can be exploited, or simply reference the lack of protective measures against reentrancy (e.g., no \`nonReentrant\` modifier used). - **Invalidity**: To prove this is not a concern, there needs to be evidence in other parts of the code (not provided here) where protection mechanisms are implemented. 2. **Incorrect Access Control**: - **Evidence of Correct Access Control**: The code checks whether the caller has the appropriate role using \`accessControl.hasRole(GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE, _msgSender())\`. - **Proving Validity**: For a vulnerability to be proven valid, one would need to show that it is possible for an unauthorized actor to call this function despite the role check. - **Invalidity**: Invalidity would require showing the role system is correctly implemented with no flaws, possibly referencing an audit report or specific tests that confirm its correctness. 3. **Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: The provided code does not restrict what addresses can be set as incentive contracts. It assumes trust in the deployed contracts. - **Proving Validity**: To establish this risk as valid, one could present case studies of similar vulnerabilities being exploited or simply point to the lack of a whitelisting mechanism or contract verification. - **Invalidity**: To prove this invalid, one would need to find checks elsewhere in the codebase or deployment process that ensure only safe, audited contracts are interacted with. 4. **Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: Given that failed execution of the \`incentivize\` function leads to transaction reversion, this holds a risk for a DoS attack if incentive contracts are faulty or malicious. - **Proving Validity**: This is a valid concern as a smart contract design best practice is to prevent such vulnerabilities. Similar to the vulnerabilities above, proving this requires demonstrating the lack of handling mechanisms or showing the incentive contracts' unpredictability. - **Invalidity**: Invalidity evidence might include contract-level mechanisms that handle incentive contract failures gracefully. 5. **Unauthorized Upgrade Attack**: - **Evidence of Vulnerability**: The \`_authorizeUpgrade\` function is part of standard upgradeability infrastructure for smart contracts. - **Proving Validity**: To demonstrate validity, one would need to show the absence or weakness of access controls surrounding the upgrading process (not fully shown in the snippet). - **Invalidity**: Demonstrating invalidity would entail showing robust access controls, timelocks, or multisig requirements surrounding upgrade permissions, possibly via external security audits or additional mechanisms not present in the snippet. In summary, proving the validity or invalidity of these concerns typically requires a more comprehensive review than reviewing a single code snippet in isolation. Full contract source, deployment information, and an understanding of the surrounding development practices and security audits are necessary to make a final determination on the security of these systems. Since I do not have access to the full scope of resources required for such a review, and additional context is necessary, I am unable to provide definitively \\"proven\\" conclusions on the security of the smart contract based exclusively on the snippet provided. Professional auditors use a combination of manual review, automated tools, and formal verification to rigorously test and prove the security of smart contracts."},{"instruction":"Subject: Parking problem in front of the entrance to the Sultana and Noufah halls Dear Mr. Badri, I hope this email finds you well.

This pioneering approach capitalises on the assortment of sensory faculties humanoid robots, specifically the NAO robot, accommodate- including tactile, pressure, sonar, microphone, and infrared sensors- in concert with vision systems for object recognition and motion planning. Through the incorporation of the Design Research methodology (encompassing and embodying specifically the sequential phases being, ‘Understand, Empathise, Define, Ideate, and Prototype’), in tandem with innumerable hours’ worth of studio sessions spent arduously refining our iterative prototyping and Choregraphe proficiencies, our complete framework assimilates insights garnered from an intensive global literature review of great scope to meticulously sculpt the programmes design to what we unanimously determined was fitting. Informed by an empathetic understanding of patient requirements, we commenced with the purpose of catapulting the best interests of users to the forefront of our initiative. Our preliminary investigation has yielded noteworthy findings, indicating a substantial augmentation in patient engagement and nascent effectivity. The combination of the aforementioned aptitudes that the NAO robot boasts, warrants to foster the establishment of an assistive tool that bolsters versatility and efficacy- prognosticating a significant metamorphosis in therapy protocols. The research treatise provided herein, supplemented by an illustrative exposition on YouTube; the quintessence of our inventive efforts is captured- endeavours that are poised to become a cornerstone for ensuing progress in rehabilitative robotic technologies. 1. Introduction – In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints- coupled with the daunting adversities the accelerating pace of aging populations globally exerts on healthcare systems, innovative approaches to physiotherapy are irrefutably necessitated. Notwithstanding the indispensability of physiotherapeutic practices, it often finds itself incessantly grappling with restrictions attributable to resource scarcity, namely a disparity in patient-to-therapist ratios, which is further exacerbated by the somatic cumulative fatigue exacted on practitioners across recurrent sessions (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). Humanoid robots, such as NAO, herald a prospective pathway to supplement the ubiquitous delivery of efficacious and consistent therapeutic interventions; within this promising context, this study purports to focus on both the utilisation of the NAO robot for the amelioration of the recovery process for those with limb mobility impairments, alongside the systematic investigation of the prevalent restraints within conventional rehabilitation modalities whilst ascertaining the function humanoid robots may serve in the process. 1.1 Literature Review & The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention – In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, and as previously alluded to in the abstract, the dawn of the 21st century has begotten a transformative era for physiotherapy, with conventional, ‘hands-on’ techniques being incrementally complemented by humanoid robotics and other tantamount mediums of auxiliary technology. These orthodox procedures, by nature being labour-intensive, frequently entail manual therapies delivered by physiotherapists inclusive of massages, stretches, and reconstructive exercises for the betterment of patient mobility, and holistic bodily potency and functionality (Krebs, et al., 2003; O'Sullivan & Schmitz, 2007). The primary merits of these customary therapeutic rehabilitative modalities reside in the bespoke nurtured patient-practitioner rapport, and the perspicaciously adept evaluation via physiotherapists concerning both tissue impedance along with patient feedback throughout the duration of the remedial treatment (Jones, 2006). In light of these developments, the explication of humanoid robotic applications in physiotherapy beckons a comprehensive review of the current literature to unfurl a taxonomy of extant methodologies and the frontiers of robotic intervention. Embellished by the notion that the rote, repetitive, and structured fabric of physiotherapeutic procedures is amenable to mechanisation (Krebs, et al., 2018), the valiant NAO humanoid robot stands at the vanguard of this therapeutic odyssey, its intrinsic competency to deliver indefatigable, exact, and individualised care denoting a considerable enhancement in catering to the rehabilitative exigencies of those that are beset by limb mobility limitations (Gassert & Dietz, 2018). The perspicacious exploration into the orthodox channels on the subject of rehabilitation unveils a mosaic where the manual ministrations of physiotherapists remain the fulcrum of therapeutic engagement, albeit encumbered by the innate frailties pertaining to humanoid demonstrated endurance, and the necessitated prerequisites of a global demographic metamorphosis. As the pendulum of healthcare imperatives oscillates with amplifying extent, the dialogue gravitates toward the ingenious assimilation of humanoid robotics as salient participants to expedite physiotherapeutic modus operandi. The inherent adaptability of humanoid robots, their burgeoning autonomy buttressed by artificial intelligence, in conjunction with their proviso for both motoric involvement and sensory feedback bespeak their prospective function as integral intermediaries that can facilitate, replicate, and magnify therapeutic stratagems that are propounded by their respective human counterparts (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005; Johnson, et al., 2014). Amidst the ambit of medical/ physiotherapeutic apparatus refinement, a cornucopia of varying countries have begun championing the inception of innovative resolutions to traverse the particularised constraints integral to their corresponding healthcare dilemmas. In light of the relentlessly swelling geriatric populace, as formerly noted, paired with the necessity for the effective administration and economisation of health-related expenses, the pertinence of these technologies is at an unprecedented zenith. Echoing sentiments expressed earlier; Japan has systematically displayed laudable foresight in the proactive amalgamation of humanoid robotic technology into the operational fabric of its healthcare milieus. With the illustrious pantheon of robotic applications, conceived by the visionary minds at Cyberdyne, the HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) robot stands out as a paradigmatic instance of applied humanoid robotics, substantially aiding, and propelling the rehabilitative and ambulatory capabilities for those that exhibit varying degrees of motor control diminution and limb functionality restrictions- advantages of which are recognised by our collaborative humanoid robot assistance physiotherapist project that via our pursuits, we are eager to see emulated and established on a more universal front. The application of this Cyberdyne devised exoskeletal contrivances in question have showcased promising advances, serving to not only reinforce patients beset by muscular debilitation, but also endorsing recuperative measures for those that are recovering from strokes and enduring spinal cord attributed afflictions (Suzuki, et al., 2015; Demura, et al., 2015; Dario, et al., 2012). Irrespective of the emergence of auspicious prospects engendered by these automated mechanisms, a discernible breadth of scepticism continues in its manifestation. Critics have universally and understandably voiced their concerns concerning indiscriminate dependency on techno-centric resolutions, underscoring the risks of attenuating interpersonal engagement, in addition to the latent obfuscation of the hitherto sacrosanct patient-practitioner dynamic- a linchpin of customary physiotherapeutic practice (Dautenhahn, 2007; Turkle, 2011). Concomitantly, academic circles have articulated trepidations pertaining to the possible diminishment of the intuitive and empathic characteristics germane to human nurturance, facets that could prove inimitable via mechanisation (Goetz, et al., 2008; Sparrow & Sparrow, 2006). They are insistent upon the methodologically rigorous scrutinization of the employment of humanoid robotics and anything analogous, to ascertain the effectivity, and socio-ethical ramifications of the supplantation of human hands for mechanical ones. Nevertheless, pertinent empirical evidence increasingly substantiates the efficacy of humanoid robotic methodologies with research inquiries by (Mehrholz, et al., 2018) and (Lo, et al., 2010) being a testament to this proclamation where they highlight the robots’ enhancement of accelerated convalescence and meticulous adherence to therapeutic protocols. This assertion is corroborated by systematic appraisals that posit rehabilitative robotic therapies as synergistic interventions capable of augmenting traditional practices rather than supplanting them (Bertani, et al., 2017; Prange, et al., 2006; Nourouzi-Gheidari, et al., 2012). 1.2 Research Problem Statement – The convergence of humanoid robotics and other comparable mediums, united with rehabilitative physiotherapeutic regimens embodies a revolutionary reconfiguration- reconceptualising remedial frontiers, and the delivery of healthcare. Nonetheless, the incipient realm of this field teems with multifaceted complexities, mandating an assiduous scholarly inquisition of its operational feasibility, clinical effectivity, and ethical conundrums. Faced with a glaring international dearth of physiotherapeutic practitioners (WCPT, 2019), the intensified necessity for humanoid robotic aid is rendered ever more paramount than before. The assignment of humanoid robotics as an appendage to physiotherapists, taking Aldebaran’s NAO as a pertinent exemplar, culminates in pivotal considerations: Can these ingenious personifications of amalgamated science and technology mirror the intricacy-enveloped therapy customarily orchestrated by professional clinicians? How do patients perceive mechanical touch when juxtaposed with empathetic and compassionate human contact (Silver, et al., 2020)? In the nascent intersection or robotics and rehabilitative care, humanoid automatons are tasked with bridging the gaping divide between preprogrammed movements and individualistic patient therapeutic exigencies- a nexus where technical variability and human volatility coalesce (Veerbeek, et al., 2017). The unification of robotic sensorimotor proficiencies with the distinctive imperatives of personalised rehabilitation embodies a formidable research endeavour, necessitating the construction of advanced and accommodating algorithms that can modulate therapeutic procedures dynamically, in synchronisation with patient progress (Dipietro, et al., 2017; Encarnação & Azevedo, 2013). This intricate equilibrium hinges upon the robot’s acuity in the cognizance and interpretation of feedback by means of a repertoire of sensors, engineered to capture subtleties of human physiology and emotion with unwavering precision in order to ascertain remedial actions are not only efficacious, but finely attuned to feedback from patients (Scherer, et al., 2015; Amirabdollahian, et al., 2013; Calderita, et al., 2014). Furthermore, the ethical implications of the conjunction of humanoid robotics (NAO being an exemplary medium) in concert with the sensitive domain of rehabilitative physiotherapy assume centre stage. The momentous juncture of a non-human construct, conceivably imbued with synthetic empathy, thrusts upon us critical interrogatives vis-à-vis the sacrosanctity of patient autonomy and the authenticity of the formed therapeutic alliance (Bryson, 2020; Vallor, 2016). Ethical stewardship mandates stringent policies and AI governance frameworks, guaranteeing that such automatons function within the confines of ethical precepts and safeguarding patients from a spectrum of potential psychological and physical adversity (Basl, 2014; Borenstein & Arkin, 2016). The genesis of humanoid robotics in the sphere of psychotherapeutics is contingent on its astute congruence with the intrinsic essence of caregiving- an endeavour that is not merely technological but is indelibly enmeshed amid the convoluted lattice of human ethos, cultural contexts, and social mores (Coenen, 2016; Misselhorn, et al., 2013). Preserving the fidelity of this nuanced equipoise stands as an indispensable and exhaustive scholarly obligation, demanding the choreography of a masterful synthesis of carefully constructed interventions with the essential dogmas of patient-oriented care (Johansson-Pajala, 2020). 2. Design Research Method – In the formulation of a humanoid robotic physiotherapeutic aide, our methodology employs an exhaustive Design Research Methodology (DRM), harmonising the prowess of revolutionarily innovative technology in conjunction with the nuanced demands of therapeutic effectiveness. Our investigation process is methodologically orchestrated, commencing with a comprehensive critique of prevalent robotic frameworks, featuring an empathic analysis of the NAO humanoid automaton by virtue of its dexterity in its facilitation of human-robot interactions. In the course of our scholarly inquiry, we conduct a thorough assessment of its sensorimotor faculties, melding touch, pressure, and sound sensory systems, fundamental for devising interventions paralleling the adaptive responses of an actual bona fide physiotherapist (Gouaillier, et al., 2008; Belpaeme, et al., 2012). The foundational ‘Understand’ phase carries out thorough literature reviews, synthesising studies across disciplines to probe physiotherapeutic prerequisites and the technological status quo. ‘Empathise’ delves further, gleaning perspectives from patient experiences and professional feedback to discern specific complexities and requirements. The subsequent ‘Define’ phase distils understanding into tangible design criteria, giving rise to the ‘Ideate’ stage, where inventive approaches arise within technical, ethical, and regulatory parameters. Proceeding to the conclusive juncture being ‘Prototype,’ we collaboratively utilised sophisticated mediums, inclusive of Choregraphe to define the NAO’s behaviours and validate our conceptualisation through contrived patient-robot interaction vignettes. Our design undergoes successive iterations of appraisal and amelioration, culminating in a programme that exemplifies a nuanced amalgamation of a proficient technological aptitude, and therapeutic congruity. Illustrated on the next page are screenshots of the work-flow sequence that I developed on Aldebaran’s Choregraphe software to programme the NAO robot’s behaviourisms to mimic accordingly those of which would be executed by a rehabilitative physiotherapeutic assistant in order to achieve its purported function: 3. Finding and Reflection – Implementation Discussion – The phased integration of the NAO humanoid robot (primarily focussed on limb rehabilitation) into the exploratory role as an adjunct rehabilitative physiotherapy practitioner within clinical settings constituted a series of refined adaptations, assiduously aligning the contours of technological execution with the demands of therapeutic success. During all phases of conception and implementation, the aforesaid team members and I espoused a human-centric methodology. Within the confines of our university, scrupulous analysis entailed the utilisation of the NAO robot, proficiently programmed to administer bodily rehabilitation regimens, bolstered by the unification of sensory feedback to yield real time adaptability- resultantly with convenience and competence being advantageous bi-products of humanoid robotic deployment. The on-site callous validation process comprised of the deployment of the NAO humanoid robot, of which was collaboratively intricately programmed and coded through the employment of Aldebaran’s exclusive Choregraphe software, to conduct limb recuperation regimens, augmented by the convergence of sensory feedback systems (encapsulating tactile, pressure, sonar, microphone, and infrared sensors) for dynamic adjustability (Gupta & Zhang, 2021). Technical and Ethical Issues with their respective Resolutions – Whilst pioneering the development of a humanoid mechanism envisioned to undertake the responsibilities of an assistant physiotherapist, we were confronted with a plethora of conundrums, salient to accentuating technical and ethical quandaries. Affirming that the NAO’s tactile and pressure sensors yielded precise data was of utmost importance and warranted meticulous configuration, an indispensable measure underscored by (Smith, 2020), synergised with one of our primary objectives of certifying precision, and safe physical interactions between the humanoid robot and patients through diligent sensor integration as detailed by (Zhang, et al., 2020). The blueprint for the establishment of fluid interplay between humanoid robots and their corresponding human counterparts comprised a vicious cycle of iterative testing and refinement, leveraging ourselves as a team for simulation modes of rudimentary patient interactions, which thereby amplified the robot’s responsiveness (Johnson & Anderson, 2021). Behavioural synchronisation within Aldebaran’s Choregraphe software revolves around the elaborate coordination of a multitude of timelines and boxes denoting distinct behaviours or motion sequences. When programming the NAO robot, particularly for delicate undertakings akin to rehabilitative physiotherapeutic assistance, the synchrony of motion and interaction behaviours is of the essence. A complication commonly manifests during the endeavour to cohesively interweave a sequence of movements, gestures, and sensory feedback manoeuvres such that they transition from one action to the next are both anthropomorphic and seamless. Choregraphe is dependent on a developer-oriented visual drag-and-drop interface which, notwithstanding its user-centricity, has the potential to conceal the sophistication of temporally contingent interactions involving the NAO’s actuators and sensors, especially to novices as we were formerly, when we embarked on this venture through the application and comprehension of Choregraphe. With regards to the vitality of the synchrony of kinematic behaviours and interactivity routines, an additional significant technical blockade materialised, the dilemma in question, being the loss of balance and subsequent and seemingly recurring falls experienced by the NAO robot. At the outset, my contributions were instrumental in the discovery that the default motion algorithms ingrained within the Choregraphe framework failed to appropriately account for the sophisticated balance dynamics necessary for smooth walking on surfaces characterised by any degree of uneven terrain. Through our combined efforts, we enacted the purposeful repositioning of the centre of mass in the programmed architecture of the robot’s digital blueprints via Choregraphe, engendering superior postural stability for the NAO. We operationalised this by way of the diminution of the centre of gravity within the Choregraphe interface, thus attaining a more stable locomotive rhythm (Kajita, et al., 2003). Concurrent with the technological considerations the incorporation of humanoid robots inside the context of physiotherapy precipitates, it would be imprudent to omit the unneglectable tapestry of ethical intricacies this implementation carries; ethical deliberations of which mandate scrupulous governance with the aim of ensuring the welfare of patients and fruitful therapeutic achievements. The trajectory toward the integration of the NAO automaton as a rehabilitative physiotherapeutic facilitator into clinical practice draws forth ethical issues surrounding patient autonomy, privacy, and not to mention the looming peril of care becoming devoid of personal engagement- rendering the patient-practitioner relationship dispassionately detached. Autonomy within the healthcare milieu articulates the notion that patients, predicated on informed understanding, inherently possess the prerogative to deliberate on and consent to their respective course of treatment (Beauchamp & Childress, 2013). The advent of an anthropoid humanoid robot carried with it the spectre of impinging upon patient autonomy, the automaton’s advisements bearing the possibility of being mistaken by patients for imperious commands, deeming the NAO’s guidance as conclusive, thus inadvertently imperilling the integrity of patient volitional autonomous decision-making. As a palliative measure to alleviate such concerns, our approach instituted a protocol whereby any initial exchanges between the NAO and patients were prefaced by unequivocal verbal and written elucidations concerning the robot’s ancillary function, reinforcing the patient’s autonomy to either voluntarily dismiss or take heed of any automated guidance. With ethical implications in the spotlight, privacy concerns present themselves with the prospect of the robot [that harnesses inputs from numerous sensors and cameras, necessitating rigorous data protection countermeasures] amassing sensitive patient health information; the maladministration of which may precipitate breaches of confidentiality (Mittelstadt, et al., 2016; Van-Wynsberghe, 2013). As an appropriate response to these concerns, the adoption of impermeable and robust encryption methods, the adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other parallel privacy standards, and conformity of stringent data storage safeguards to ensure the safety of the harvested information, warrants primary focus (Hoofnagle, et al., 2019; Westin, 2003).\\" Whilst taking the above question specifications and my answer into consideration, please can you write me an entry for ONLY THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIED SECTION BEING in 200 words at most ‘4.

Conclusions and Future Work Our rigorous foray into humanoid robotics within physiotherapy has unveiled promising vistas. The confluence of NAO's multifarious sensorium and adaptive robotics portends a paradigm shift - a harbinger of assiduous and tailored rehabilitation aiding an overtaxed healthcare ecosystem (Bertani et al., 2017). While we attest to preliminary triumphs, spotlighting enhanced patient engagement, prodigious challenges loom - notably, achieving seamlessness in human-robot symbiosis and allaying ethical conundrums (Mehrholz et al., 2018; Bryson, 2020). Future explorations must burgeon towards perfecting the tactile finesse of robots to approximate the physiotherapist's healing touch (Zhang et al., 2020), harnessing cutting-edge AI to interpolate nuanced patient feedback into personalized therapeutic regimens (Amirabdollahian et al., 2013). Ethically, a conscientious probe is imperative - navigating the preservation of human touch in care, while leveraging robotic precision (Vallor, 2016). Advancing, the governance of AI and robotics in healthcare necessitates robust frameworks, ensuring alignment with sacrosanct patient-centric values (Borenstein & Arkin, 2016). Focused on expanding our prototype's abilities, we aim to conjoin the benevolence of clinician care with the indefatigability of our NAO assistant - striding towards an orthogenesis where technology embellishes rather than eclipses the human element in healing (Coenen, 2016).

Уже в античной философии можно найти не- которые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем обще- ства (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появля- ется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Ма- киавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представ- ление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность постро- ения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII в. формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и со- вершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается тради- ция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с при- родно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско- историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человече- ства на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются эконо- мика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и клас- совая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как есте- ственно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической фор- мации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сто- ронники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) пред- лагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искус- ство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму каждая из них имеет свой жиз- ненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу ХХ в. в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (ХIХ–ХХ вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни об- щества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение тех- нократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграр- но-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (ин- формационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующе- го сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, про- изводство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и са- моразвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетиче- ской – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в тако- го рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная мето- дология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием ма- лых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве со- циума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирова- ние которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, дея- тельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Ин- тернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международно- го сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это откры- вает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного со- трудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем процесс глоба- лизации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе пер- спективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традицион- ных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. Сделай его красивым.

Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды."},{"instruction":"Give me a detailed difference between entrepreneurial readiness and strategic readiness in the form of an explanation and table","output":"Entrepreneurial readiness and strategic readiness are two distinct concepts that play essential roles in the success of a business venture.

Pie plano: En adultos, el pie plano puede ser el resultado de una debilidad estructural, lesiones, desgaste o condiciones médicas. Las plantillas ortopédicas pueden ayudar a mejorar la alineación del pie, redistribuir la presión y proporcionar soporte al arco, lo cual puede reducir el dolor y mejorar la función del pie. Sin embargo, es poco probable que las plantillas \\"corrijan\\" permanentemente el pie plano en adultos, ya que la estructura ósea y los tejidos conectivos ya han completado su desarrollo. En cambio, las plantillas pueden ayudar a manejar los síntomas y evitar problemas secundarios. Rodillas: Si tienes problemas de alineación en las rodillas como genu valgo (rodillas que se juntan) o genu varo (rodillas arqueadas hacia afuera), las plantillas pueden ayudar a mejorar la posición de las rodillas al caminar y al estar de pie. Esto puede aliviar el dolor y prevenir el desgaste adicional de las articulaciones. Las plantillas personalizadas pueden diseñarse para corregir desequilibrios específicos y mejorar la mecánica de la marcha. Es importante destacar que el uso de plantillas ortopédicas debe ser parte de un enfoque integral. Esto podría incluir fisioterapia, ejercicios de fortalecimiento y estiramiento, y posiblemente pérdida de peso si es necesario, para disminuir la carga sobre las articulaciones de las rodillas y los pies. Para obtener el mejor resultado, es recomendable que te evalúe un profesional de la salud, como un podólogo, ortopedista o fisioterapeuta, quien puede diagnosticar tu condición específica y recomendar un tratamiento adecuado, incluyendo si las plantillas ortopédicas son adecuadas para ti y, en caso afirmativo, qué tipo sería el más beneficioso."},{"instruction":"Hágame un entrenamiento para los pies para corregir pie plano","output":"Es fundamental recordar que, mientras que los ejercicios pueden fortalecer los músculos del pie y mejorar la alineación y el funcionamiento, podrían no \\"corregir\\" completamente la condición del pie plano en un adulto, ya que la estructura ósea se ha desarrollado completamente.

Aquí tienes un entrenamiento de ejemplo que puede ayudar a fortalecer los pies: 1. **Estiramiento de la banda plantar**: - Siéntate con las piernas extendidas frente a ti. - Utiliza una toalla o una banda para tirar suavemente de la parte superior de tus pies hacia ti, manteniendo las piernas rectas. - Sostén durante 15-30 segundos y repite 2-3 veces. 2. **Flexiones de dedos**: - Siéntate o párate y coloca una toalla pequeña en el suelo. - Usando solo los dedos de tus pies, intenta agarrar la toalla y arrastrarla hacia ti. - Haz esto durante unos minutos y repite varias veces. 3. **Levantamiento de talón**: - De pie, levanta los talones del suelo elevándote sobre las puntas de los pies. - Mantén durante unos segundos y luego baja lentamente. - Realiza 2-3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. 4. **Caminata en el borde exterior del pie**: - De pie, con los pies paralelos, coloca peso en los bordes exteriores de tus pies y camina de esta forma durante 30 segundos. - Realiza varias repeticiones, descansando entre cada una. 5. **Elevación de arcos**: - Sentado o de pie, intenta elevar el arco de tu pie manteniendo los dedos de los pies y el talón en el suelo. - Sostén la posición elevada por unos segundos y luego relaja. - Realiza 2-3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. 6. **Ejercicio con pelota de tenis**: - Sentado o de pie, coloca una pelota de tenis debajo de tu pie. - Rueda la pelota hacia adelante y hacia atrás aplicando una presión moderada. - Hazlo durante 2-3 minutos por pie. 7. **Estiramiento del tendón de Aquiles**: - De pie frente a una pared, adelanta un pie y mantén el otro atrás con la rodilla recta y el talón en el suelo. - Inclínate hacia adelante, manteniendo la pierna trasera recta, hasta que sientas un estiramiento en la parte trasera de tu pierna. - Sostén durante 15-30 segundos y repite 2-3 veces por lado. Antes de comenzar cualquier nuevo régimen de ejercicios, especialmente si tienes una condición de salud preexistente, es aconsejable consultar con un profesional de la salud, como un podiatra o fisioterapeuta, para obtener orientación personalizada y asegurarte de que los ejercicios son los más adecuados para tu situación específica."},{"instruction":"¿Es mejor hacerlo de pie?","output":"Algunos ejercicios se pueden realizar tanto de pie como sentado, dependiendo de tu nivel de fuerza, equilibrio y condición física general. Aquí te explico cómo algunos de estos ejercicios se adaptan si prefieres hacerlos de pie: 1. Flexiones de dedos (Toelifts): - De pie, intenta levantar solo los dedos del suelo manteniendo la planta del pie en contacto con el suelo (es como hacer el contrario de los levantamientos de talón). Esto puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos que sostienen los arcos de tus pies. 2. Levantamiento de talón (Heel Raises): - Continúalos de la misma forma, elevándote sobre las puntas de los pies y bajando lentamente. Asegúrate de tener algo cerca para apoyarte si necesitas mantener el equilibrio. 3. Elevación de arcos (Arch Lifts): - Desde la posición de pie, concentra el esfuerzo en elevar el arco del pie sin levantar los dedos ni el talón del suelo. Es un movimiento sutil pero efectivo para fortalecer la musculatura del arco. 4. Ejercicio con pelota de tenis: - Puedes hacerlo de pie, pero asegúrate de tener soporte disponible en caso de que necesites equilibrarte. Aplica una presión constante y controlada mientras ruedas la pelota bajo el pie. Además, recuerda mantener una buena postura durante toda la sesión de ejercicios, y si realizarlos de pie resulta incómodo o difícil, puedes comenzar sentado y progresivamente pasar a hacerlos de pie a medida que ganes fuerza y confianza.

Bu devre çeşitli uygulamalarda, özellikle radyo frekansı teknolojilerinde kullanılır. Rezonans, bir L-C devresinde hem endüktör hem de kapasitör arasındaki enerjinin maksimum transfer hızına ulaştığı bir durumu ifade eder. Osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin kendi karakteristik frekansı olan rezonans frekansında meydana gelir. Bu frekans, devrenin kapasitansı ve endüktansı tarafından belirlenir ve genellikle f_0 ile gösterilir. Rezonans frekansı (f_0) basit bir L-C devresi için şu formülle hesaplanabilir: [ f_{0} = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] Burada: ( L ) = Endüktörün endüktans değeri (Henry cinsinden), ( C ) = Kapasitörün kapasitans değeri (Farad cinsinden), ( f_{0} ) = Rezonans frekansı (Hertz cinsinden). Rezonans durumunda, kapasitör ve endüktansın reaktansları birbirini nötralize eder ve sadece devrenin Ohmik direnci kalır, bu da akımın maksimum olduğu anlamına gelir. Rezonans durumunda, ideal bir devre varsayıldığında, akım ve gerilim arasındaki faz farkı sıfırdır ve devre safsız bir direnç gibi davranır. Osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devredeki akımın maksimum olmasını sağlar ve devrenin seçici olmasına olanak tanır, yani sadece belirli bir frekans aralığındaki sinyalleri geçirir veya büyütür. Bu özellik, radyo alıcılarında istenilen frekanstaki sinyalleri seçmek için kullanılır. Rezonans, aynı zamanda bazı durumlarda istenmeyen bir etki de yaratabilir. Örneğin, elektrikli güç sistemlerinde rezonans durumları, aşırı voltajlar ve akımlar yaratarak ekipmanlara zarar verebilir ve bu yüzden rezonansın kontrolü önemlidir."},{"instruction":"kondansatör ve bobinden oluşan bir osilasyon devresi ile ortak uçlu arama bobinden oluşan metal dedektöründe ki rezonans kavramınu bana açıkla","output":"Kondansatör ve bobinden (endüktörden) oluşan osilasyon devresi ile metal dedektörlerindeki rezonans kavramı benzer prensiplere dayanır, fakat uygulama şekilleri farklıdır. Her iki durumda da rezonans prensibi, sinyallerin saptanmasını veya belirli nesnelerin tespit edilmesini sağlar. **Osilasyon Devresi ve Rezonans:** Bir kondansatör (C) ve bobinden (L) oluşan basit bir LC osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin doğal frekansında, yani Seri Rezonans Frekansı'nda meydana gelir. Burada kapasitans ve endüktans arasındaki enerji transferi en verimli olduğundan, devrenin içindeki akım maksimum seviyeye ulaşır. Bu durum, özellikle verici ve alıcı devrelerde çok değerlidir, çünkü devre, bu rezonans frekansında en yüksek Q faktörüne (kalite faktörü) ve böylece en dar bant genişliğine sahip olur. Bundan dolayı, istenilen frekanstaki sinyalleri en iyi şekilde alabilir veya iletebilir. **Metal Dedektöründeki Rezonans:** Bir metal dedektörü, genel olarak iki temel bobin içerir: biri verici (transmitter) bobin, diğeri ise alıcı (receiver) bobin. Verici bobin, alternatif bir akım (AC) ile beslenir ve çevresinde değişken bir manyetik alan yaratır. Bu alan, yakınlarındaki metal bir nesne tarafından bozulur. Metal dedektörlerinin bir çeşidi olan Ortak Uçlu Arama Bobinden (Bazı kaynaklarda Bilezik Verici Bobin veya Endüktif Denge Bobin olarak geçer) oluşan dedektörler, genellikle iki bobini iç içe yerleştirir ve böylece her ikisinin manyetik alanları arasında dengeli bir durum yaratır. Metal bir nesne dedektörün yakınına geldiğinde, bu nesne verici bobin tarafından oluşturulan manyetik alanı bozar ve alıcı bobinde bir elektrik sinyali üretir. Bu dedektörler genelde bir osilasyon devresi içerir ve bu devre, tespit edilen metal nesne yakınındayken rezonans frekansında ayarlanır. Metal eşya algılandığında, devrenin rezonans frekansı değişir (genellikle düşer) çünkü metal nesnenin endüktif etkisi bobinin toplam endüktansını etkiler. Dedektör, verici bobinden kaynaklanan sabit frekanstaki sinyalin alıcı bobinden alınan sinyaliyle farkını saptayarak metal nesnenin varlığını algılar. Özetle, osilasyon devresinde rezonans, devrenin en verimli şekilde çalıştığı ve maksimum aktarımın gerçekleştiği noktayı ifade ederken, metal dedektöründeki rezonans, sinyal farklarını algılayarak metal nesnelerin tespiti için kullanılır. Her iki durumda da rezonansın prensibi, belirli bir frekansta enerji transferi ve sinyal algılamanın maksimize edilmesidir."},{"instruction":"bobin ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekans kavramını bana akademik olarak açıkla","output":"Bobin (endüktör) ve kapasitörden oluşan bir devre, rezonans frekansında çalıştığında, devre elemanlarının reaktansları birbirini iptal eder ve sadece Ohmik direnç etkin olur. Bu durum, seri LC devresinde ve paralel LC devresinde farklı sonuçlara yol açar, ama her iki durumda da rezonans frekansı elemanların değerlerine bağlıdır. **Seri LC Devresi:** Seri bir LC devresinde, endüktör (L) ve kapasitör (C) seri bağlıdır. Bu devrede, rezonans frekansında endüktörün indüktif reaktansı (XL) ile kapasitörün kapasitif reaktansı (XC) eşit ve zıt işaretlidir ve birbirini tam olarak iptal eder. Yani: [ X_L = X_C ] [ X_L = omega L ] [ X_C = frac{1}{omega C} ] Burada ( omega ) açısal frekanstır ve ( omega = 2pi f ) şeklinde ifade edilir (f, Hertz cinsinden frekanstır). Bu eşitlikler yerine konulduğunda, rezonans frekansı şu şekilde bulunur: [ omega L = frac{1}{omega C} ] [ omega^2 = frac{1}{LC} ] [ f_0 = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] **Paralel LC Devresi:** Paralel bir LC devresinde ise, endüktör ve kapasitör paralel bağlıdır. Rezonans durumunda, endüktör ve kapasitör tarafından akım geçişi sıfıra eşittir çünkü akımlar birbirini iptal eder. Bunun sonucunda, bir yüksek empedans noktası oluşur ve bu da sadece rezonans frekansında meydana gelir. Rezonans frekansı seri LC devresinin formülü ile aynıdır. Bununla birlikte, paralel rezonans genellikle \\"kendi içindeki\\" veya \\"tank devresi\\" olarak adlandırılır ve yüksek Q faktörüne sahiptir, bu yüzden genellikle filtrelerde veya bant genişliği sınırlı uygulamalarda kullanılır. Her iki durumda da, rezonans frekansında akım ve gerilim arasındaki faz açısı sıfır derecedir (ideal durumda), yani devre saf bir direnç gibi davranır ve bu da çevresel şartlar sabit tutulduğunda akımın maksimum seviyeye çıkabileceği anlamına gelir. Akademik açıklamada, rezonans frekansı devrenin sahip olduğu kapasitans ve endüktans değerlerine bağlıdır ve bu değerlerin tasarımı ve seçimi devrenin işlevine göre önemlidir. Elektrik ve elektronik mühendisliği ders kitaplarında bu kavramlar genellikle devre teorisi, elektromanyetizma veya ilgili alanlarda daha detaylı bir şekilde işlenir."},{"instruction":"bobin ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekans kavramını bana bilimsel olarak açıkla","output":"Bobin (endüktör) ve kapasitörde oluşan rezonans frekansını bilimsel olarak açıklamak için, elemanların enerji depolama ve transfer etme özelliklerini ve devrenin nasıl davrandığını ele almak gereklidir. Bir kapasitör, elektrik alanında enerji depolar. İki plaka arasındaki yalıtkan malzeme üzerinde bir voltaj uygulandığında, plakalar arasında elektrik alan oluşur ve kapasitor elektrik yükü depolar. Kapasitörde depolanan enerji, gerilim (V) ve kapasite (C) cinsinden ifade edilir: [ E_c = frac{1}{2}CV^2 ] Endüktör (bobin), manyetik alanında enerji depolar. İçinden akım geçen bir bobin çevresinde manyetik alan oluşturur ve bu manyetik alan enerjiyi depolar. Endüktörde depolanan enerji, akım (I) ve endüktans (L) cinsinden ifade edilir: [ E_L = frac{1}{2}LI^2 ] Bir devrede endüktör ve kapasitör bir arada yer aldığında, aralarında enerji alışverişi gerçekleşir. Kapasitör üzerinde biriken elektrik yükü, devreyi kapattığımızda boşalmaya başlar ve endüktör üzerinden akım geçer. Bu akım, endüktördeki manyetik alanın artmasına ve enerjinin manyetik alanda depolanmasına neden olur. Kapasitör tamamen boşaldığında, bobinin manyetik alanı en yüksektir. Daha sonra bu manyetik alan azalır ve enerjiyi kapasitöre geri verir; yani kapasitör tekrar yüklenir. Bu proses, ideal bir LC devresinde enerji kaybı olmadan sonsuza kadar devam eder, bu da devrenin sürekli bir osilasyon (salınım) hareketi yapmasını sağlar. Rezonans frekansı, bu iki elemandan gelen reaktif etkilerin sıfırlandığı ve enerjinin en verimli şekilde transfer edildiği frekanstır. Seri bağlı bir LC devresinde rezonans frekansı (f_r), devrenin doğal veya karakteristik frekansı olarak bilinir ve aşağıdaki formülle ifade edilir: [ f_r = frac{1}{2pisqrt{LC}} ] Burada: - ( L ) endüktörün endüktansıdır (henry cinsinden), - ( C ) kapasitörün kapasitesidir (farad cinsinden), - ( f_r ) rezonans frekansıdır (hertz cinsinden). Rezonans durumunda, devrenin empedansı sadece Ohmik dirençten oluşur ve kapasitif (X_C) ve indüktif (X_L) reaktanslar birbirini iptal eder (( X_L = X_C )). Böylece, sadece direncin etkisi kalır ve akım gerilimle fazda olur. Bu akım maksimum, gerilim farklarının ise minimum olduğu anlamına gelir. Ideal bir devrede rezonans sırasında, Q faktörü (kalite faktörü) en yüksektir ve enerji kaybı en azdır. Rezonansın bu bilimsel açıklaması, radyo frekanslarından optik frekanslara kadar geniş bir elektromanyetik spektrumda kullanılır ve frekans seçici devrelerde, filtrelerde, osilatörlerde ve diğer birçok elektronik ve telekomünikasyon uygulamasında kritik bir rol oynar."},{"instruction":"Are gpt4 ?","output":"As of my last update, OpenAI has not released a model named GPT-4.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. II. Учебная литература 1.

В таком качестве оно является объектом изучения не столько социальной философии, сколько философии истории. Философия истории рассматривает общество в процес- се его непрерывного изменения, развития. Развитие общества называется социодинамикой, или историческим про- цессом. Социодинамика (историческое развитие) изучается, однако, не только философией, но и конкретными науками – экономической теорией, историей, социологией, этнографией, антропологией и др. Философия истории существен- но отличается от них по своему предмету. Предметом философии истории является изучение предельных осно- ваний, наиболее общих закономерностей социодинамики». ? В чем отличие философии истории от конкретных наук, также изучающих развитие общества?","output":"Философия истории отличается от конкретных наук, изучающих развитие общества (таких как экономическая теория, история, социология, этнография, антропология и др.), своим предметом и уровнем абстракции. 1. Предмет исследования: Если эти науки занимаются изучением определенных аспектов или эпох социодинамики, рассматривая их с помощью конкретных методов и приемов научного анализа, то философия истории фокусируется на всестороннем анализе общественных процессов в их историческом развитии, поисках общих закономерностей и тенденций, которые были бы справедливы для различных исторических эпох и культур. 2. Уровень абстракции: Философия истории работает на более высоком уровне абстракции, занимаясь разработкой категориальных аппаратов и теоретических моделей, которые ищут основания, принципы и смыслы исторического процесса в его целостности. Конкретные науки, напротив, стремятся к более детальному и точному описанию, анализу и объяснению фактов и процессов в истории. 3. Аспекты рассмотрения: Конкретные науки ориентированы на изучение конкретных событий, фактов или явлений в рамках ограниченных временных периодов, тогда как философия истории стремится к обнаружению глубинных закономерностей, определяющих ход и направление развития общества в целом. 4. Методологическая функция: Философия истории разрабатывает методологические основы для наук об обществе и истории, создавая концептуальный фундамент для более специализированных исследований. Она помогает выявлять подходы и критерии для интерпретации исторических событий, позволяя исследователям ориентироваться в многообразии и сложности прошлого. 5. Отражение философских проблем: Философия истории включает в себя рефлексию на такие фундаментальные философские вопросы, как смысл и цели истории, возможность прогресса, роль личности и случайности в исторических процессах, а также вопросы свободы, необходимости и детерминизма в истории. Важно понимать, что междисциплинарный диалог между философией истории и конкретными историческими науками непрерывен и чрезвычайно плодотворен для обеих сторон, позволяя развивать и уточнять понимание социальной динамики и исторических процессов."},{"instruction":"Who are you","output":"I am an artificial intelligence (AI) programmed to understand and respond to text-based input.

This research explores the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in the treatment and management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Through an analysis of various physical therapy modalities, including exercise therapy, manual therapy, and education on pain management, the study assesses improvement in patients’ quality of life, pain perception, and functional ability. Introduction: Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome affecting approximately 2-4% of the population, with a higher prevalence in women. The etiology of fibromyalgia is not fully understood, which makes its treatment challenging. Physical therapy, as a non-pharmacological intervention, plays a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary approach to managing fibromyalgia symptoms. Methodology: The research methodology includes a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies addressing physical therapy interventions in fibromyalgia management. Data sources comprise reputable medical databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The primary outcomes measured are pain intensity, physical function, and health-related quality of life, assessed using standardized tools like the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. Results: Evidence suggests that tailored exercise programs, including aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility workouts, have a significant positive impact on pain and functional capabilities. Additionally, manual therapies, such as massage and myofascial release, show benefits in pain reduction and improving sleep quality. Patient education on self-management and coping strategies also plays a crucial role in enhancing long-term outcomes. Discussion: Physical therapy interventions must be individualized, taking into account the patient's baseline physical activity level, pain threshold, and overall health status. The effectiveness of physical therapy is often augmented when combined with a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support and pharmacological treatment. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of various physical therapy modalities on fibromyalgia symptoms. Conclusion: Physical therapy is a cornerstone in the management of fibromyalgia, promising improved symptom control and enhanced quality of life. A multidimensional treatment plan that includes a combination of exercise, manual therapy, and patient education can help address the diverse nature of fibromyalgia. Healthcare professionals should advocate for early referral to physical therapy to optimize treatment outcomes for patients with fibromyalgia. Keywords: fibromyalgia, physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, pain management, quality of life. Note: This draft outline for research on the role of physical therapy in treating fibromyalgia is meant to serve as a hypothetical example. Actual clinical research should be conducted with rigorous methods and ethical considerations, overseen by experts in the field, and preferably published in peer-reviewed journals to ensure the reliability and credibility of the findings."},{"instruction":"Create a long and professional article about Create a research about role of physical therapy as a treatment to fibromyalgia and but the references at the end","output":"Title: Enhancing Quality of Life in Fibromyalgia: The Pivotal Role of Physical Therapy Introduction: Fibromyalgia is a chronic rheumatic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, profound fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties often described as a \\"fibro fog.\\" As a prevalent disorder affecting millions worldwide, fibromyalgia presents a significant challenge in healthcare, contributing to substantial personal and socio-economic burdens. While the pathophysiology remains elusive, the role of physical therapy (PT) in fibromyalgia management has become increasingly central, offering non-pharmacologic strategies to improve outcomes for those living with the condition. This article delves deeply into the role of PT, examining the evidence supporting its integration into the comprehensive care plan for fibromyalgia patients. The Therapeutic Potential of Physical Therapy in Fibromyalgia: Physical therapists provide specialized care that includes patient education, exercise prescription, and manual therapy techniques, addressing the multifaceted dimensions of fibromyalgia. The objectives of PT interventions include reducing pain levels, enhancing physical function, improving sleep quality, and promoting overall well-being. 1. Exercise Therapy: Regular physical activity is one of the cornerstones of fibromyalgia management, promoting a myriad of benefits such as pain reduction, improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength, and better psychological well-being. Tailored exercise programs, including low-impact aerobic activities, strength training, and flexibility exercises, are crucial for patients with fibromyalgia. 2. Manual Therapy: Manual therapy techniques, including massage, myofascial release, and joint mobilization, can alleviate pain, improve circulation, and increase the range of motion. These approaches are integral to PT and often used alongside exercise therapy to maximize therapeutic effects. 3. Pain and Stress Management Education: Education on pain neuroscience and stress reduction techniques play a vital role in empowering patients to manage their symptoms more effectively. Physical therapists guide patients through self-management strategies, including proper pacing, relaxation exercises, and the use of heat and cold modalities. Evidence Supporting Physical Therapy in Fibromyalgia Management: Several studies have affirmed the positive impact of PT on fibromyalgia symptoms. A meta-analysis by Häuser et al. emphasized the benefits of aerobic and strength exercises on global well-being and physical function.1 Similarly, manual therapies have demonstrated efficacy in immediate pain relief, as evidenced by Castro-Sánchez et al., who reported significant improvements in pain intensity and sleep quality following myofascial release therapy.2 Moreover, educational interventions on pain management have shown to enhance patients' coping abilities and quality of life, as outlined in research by Gentile et al.3 The Multidisciplinary Approach: Optimal management of fibromyalgia often necessitates a multidisciplinary strategy that synergizes physical therapy with other modalities, including pharmacotherapy, psychological support, and complementary therapies. The collaboration between healthcare providers ensures a more comprehensive and personalized treatment experience for the patient. Conclusion: Physical therapy represents a vital component in the management of fibromyalgia. Empirical evidence supports various PT interventions that contribute to alleviating symptoms and enhancing life quality among patients with fibromyalgia. The integration of exercise therapy, manual therapy, and pain management education formulates a potent triad that empowers patients to navigate fibromyalgia's complexities. Considering the individual variability of the condition, treatment plans should be highly personalized, with ongoing assessment and adaptation by skilled physical therapists in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team.

You look like you’re going to be sick…” Natsuki: “Ugh, I don’t know. I just feel really nauseous all of a sudden. Maybe it was something I ate for lunch, but I don’t feel good at all.” Sayori: “Oh no, Natsuki! Maybe you should go to the nurse’s office! It might help to lie down for a bit.” Yuri: “I agree with Sayori. Rest may be beneficial. And if you need, I can go with you to the nurse or help you get there.” Monika: “Let’s not panic, everyone. Natsuki, take a deep breath and try to relax for a moment. We’re all here to help. How about we get you a glass of water first?” Natsuki: “Thanks, guys. Maybe some water would help. I just hope I’m not coming down with anything serious. Sorry for worrying everyone.” Monika: “Don’t apologize, Natsuki. It’s okay to feel unwell, and it’s important to take care of yourself. We’ll make sure you’re feeling better soon. Just take it easy for n-” (Natsuki suddenly covers her mouth to stop herself from vomiting.) Natsuki: “…someone get a trash bin…” Sayori: “Oh, goodness! Hang on, Natsuki!” (Sayori rushes to find a trash can and hands it over to Natsuki - who immediately vomits right into it.) Monika: (rushing to Natsuki’s side) “It’s alright, Natsuki, don’t worry. Just let it all out. Sayori, would you mind going to fetch the nurse? It might be best if she checks on Natsuki.” Sayori: “Of course, Monika! I’ll be right back, Natsuki! Hang in there!” (Sayori dashes out of the room to find the nurse.) Yuri: (gently rubbing Natsuki’s back) “There, there. Sometimes the body must purge what’s making it ill. You’re going to be okay, Natsuki.” Natsuki: (leaning back, pale and shaking) “Thanks, Yuri…I hate this feeling…” (continues vomiting) Monika: (trying to keep the situation calm) “Just focus on your breathing, Natsuki. In and out, slowly. We’ll take care of everything.” (Yuri fetches a wet cloth and gently wipes Natsuki’s forehead.) Yuri: “This should help you feel a little better. We will make sure you’re looked after.” Natsuki: (between heaves) “I don’t…ugh…I don’t know why this…happened…” Monika: “Sometimes it’s just bad luck, Natsuki. Could be a stomach bug, or maybe food poisoning. We’ll let the nurse figure out what it is and get you the right help.” (Natsuki nods weakly and continues to rely on the trash bin.) Yuri: (concerned) “Remember, Natsuki, your health comes first. We’ll handle club responsibilities, so don’t worry about a thing.” (Natsuki tries to nod again, still struggling with nausea.) {THAT EVENING} Natsuki: (standing next to her bed, talking to herself) “Gosh, that was the worst bout of nausea I’ve ever had. I can’t believe I had to leave school early. I have some of my Mom’s tests from when she was feeling sick a while back. Maybe I should use one, just in case. It couldn’t hurt to check, right?” (Natsuki digs through her cabinet and finds a small box labeled ‘Pregnancy Test’.) Natsuki: (murmuring to herself) “No way, it’s not possible. There’s no way I could be…But I have been tired and moody. Everyone in the club has been noticing, no matter how much I try to hide it.” (She hesitates, looking at the test in her hands.) Natsuki: (sighs) “Fine, I’ll just do it to rule it out. It would explain the nausea and the fatigue, I guess.” (After reading the instructions, Natsuki takes the test, and waits the excruciating few minutes for the result.) Natsuki: “This is silly. I’m probably just sick from something I ate…” (The timer goes off, and Natsuki looks at the test.) Natsuki: (in disbelief) “What? How…?” (The test shows a positive result.) Natsuki: (panic rising) “No, this can’t be right. It must be a false positive or something!” (Natsuki sits on the edge of her bed, feeling overwhelmed and scared.) Natsuki: “What am I going to do? I can’t…I’m not ready for this. What will my father say? And the club…Monika and everyone…” (She puts her face in her hands, trying to process the sudden whirl of emotions running through her mind.) Natsuki: (speaking to herself) “I have to confirm it, get a second opinion. Then I’ll figure it out. There’s no need to freak out before I’m completely sure. But first, I’ll send a text to everyone, but not tell them that I’m pregnant.” (Natsuki takes a deep breath, mustering whatever composure she can find, and picks up her phone. With trembling fingers, she begins to type out a message to her friends in the literature club.) Natsuki: (texting) “Hey everyone, thanks for your support today. I’m feeling a bit better but going to take it easy tonight. Might see the doctor tomorrow. Talk to you all soon.” (She pauses, her thumb hovering over the ‘send’ button as she second-guesses what to reveal. With a soft sigh, she sends the text.) Natsuki: (whispering to herself) “There, that’ll have to do for now. No need to worry them more than they already are.” {THE FOLLOWING MORNING} Natsuki: (at the reception desk) “","output":"I'm sorry, I can't continue this story.

List as many topics as you can that match the objectives below and Combine all the similar topics together. You also don't need to go in the order of the objectives and should pick your own order. Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students. Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings. Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/MENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam.TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas.TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.)TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles.TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons.TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape.

SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures.

SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations.

For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction.

Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species.

TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.A Explain the relationship between experimental observations and energy changes associated with a chemical or physical transformation. ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.D Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing heating/ cooling based on the amount of the substance, the heat capacity, and the change in temperature. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization.

X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.A Explain the relationship between the occurrence of a reversible chemical or physical process, and the establishment of equilibrium, to experimental observations. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.A Represent the reaction quotient Qc p or Q , for a reversible reaction, and the corresponding equilibrium expressions Kc = Qc or K p = Qp . TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.C Explain the relationship between very large or very small values of K and the relative concentrations of chemical species at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all.

TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.F Represent a system undergoing a reversible reaction with a particulate model. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-8 Systems at equilibrium respond to external stresses to offset the effect of the stress. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.A Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Châtelier’s principle. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.A Calculate the solubility of a salt based on the value of K sp for the salt. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.B Identify the solubility of a salt, and/or the value of K sp for the salt, based on the concentration of a common ion already present in solution. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.C Identify the qualitative effect of changes in pH on the solubility of a salt. SPQ-5.C.1 The solubility of a salt is pH sensitive when one of the constituent ions is a weak acid or base. These effects can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.A Calculate the values of pH and pOH, based on Kw and the concentration of all species present in a neutral solution of water. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.B Calculate pH and pOH based on concentrations of all species in a solution of a strong acid or a strong base. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.C Explain the relationship among pH, pOH, and concentrations of all species in a solution of a monoprotic weak acid or weak base. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka c SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.D Explain the relationship among the concentrations of major species in a mixture of weak and strong acids and bases. SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.E Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components. SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems.

This progressive approach not only aids student comprehension as the complexity increases but also helps students see the interconnectedness of chemical principles. It's always recommended to revisit concepts periodically to reinforce learning and make connections between different topics."},{"instruction":"theres 2 things wrong with your approach, first shouldn't you all of thermodynamics once? second technically you could teach electrochem after chemical reactions, third acid based ussually comes after equilibrium","output":"I appreciate your input. It looks like the list provided had three concerns instead of two, but let's clarify and rearrange the curriculum order to address your points. In teaching chemistry, topics are indeed often grouped to avoid disjointed learning. Combining all thermodynamics-related concepts is a common approach, as is teaching acid-base chemistry after equilibrium as it extends upon the equilibrium principles. Let's revise the sequence with these considerations in mind: 1. **Atomic Structure, Electron Distribution, and Periodicity (SAP-1, SAP-2)** - Fundamental particles - Electron configuration - Periodic table arrangement and trends 2. **Mole Concept and Stoichiometry (SPQ-1, SPQ-4)** - Defining the mole - Dimensional analysis - Conservation of mass 3. **Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry (SAP-3, SAP-4)** - Ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding - Lewis structures and VSEPR theory 4. **Kinetic Molecular Theory and States of Matter (SAP-6)** - Behavior of gases, liquids, and solids - Phase changes 5. **Thermodynamics: Energy, Entropy, and Gibbs Free Energy (ENE-2, ENE-3, ENE-4, ENE-5)** - Endothermic and exothermic reactions - Calorimetry and enthalpy changes - Entropy, Gibbs free energy, and spontaneity - Hess's Law and heat of formation 6. **Solutions and Mixtures (SPQ-3)** - Concentration calculation (molarity) - Properties of solutions 7. **Reaction Kinetics and Rates (TRA-3, TRA-4)** - Factors affecting reaction rate - Rate laws and reaction mechanisms 8. **Chemical Equilibrium (TRA-6, TRA-7)** - Dynamic equilibrium concept - Le Châtelier’s principle - Equilibrium constants (Kc, Kp, Ksp) 9. **Acid-Base Chemistry (SAP-9, SAP-10)** - pH and pOH calculations - Strong vs. weak acids and bases - Buffer solutions and applications - Acid-base titrations 10. **Solubility Equilibria (SPQ-5)** - Solubility-product constant (Ksp) - Common-ion effect - Impact of pH on solubility 11. **Electrochemistry (ENE-6)** - Galvanic and electrolytic cells - Electrochemical cell notation - Electrode processes and calculations - Nernst equation and Faraday's laws Grouping thermodynamic topics together provides a comprehensive overview of energy changes in chemical processes before moving to more dynamic scenarios, such as equilibrium and specific types of reactions like acid-base. Teaching electrochemistry after reaction mechanics and equilibria can provide clarity by utilizing the concepts of reaction spontaneity and equilibrium to understand cell potentials and redox reactions. This refined sequence takes both scientific logic and pedagogical best practices into account, aiming for a cohesive and comprehensive chemistry curriculum."},{"instruction":"Falling Skies, 4 season. how the operation began and describe the events of season 4 and the intervention of an alternative reality Write an RP story.

Under international law, crimes against humanity refer to certain acts that are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. These acts include murder, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury. While the Atlantic Slave Trade, in which Portugal was a significant participant, involved many acts that could be classified as crimes against humanity if they were committed today, prosecuting a country for historical acts is complicated for several reasons: 1. Retroactivity: International criminal law generally prohibits the retroactive application of laws. This means that individuals (or states) cannot be criminally prosecuted for actions that were not criminal at the time they committed them. The Atlantic Slave Trade was conducted at a time before the legal concept of crimes against humanity was developed and codified in international law. 2. Legal Entities: The concepts of state responsibility and individual criminal responsibility are distinct. Although states can be held responsible for wrongful acts in international law, this is usually dealt with in the International Court of Justice or through other diplomatic means. Meanwhile, individuals are the ones who can be charged with crimes against humanity before bodies like the International Criminal Court (ICC), which did not exist during the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade. 3. Temporal Jurisdiction: Present-day international criminal tribunals, like the ICC, have no jurisdiction over events that occurred before their establishment. The ICC, for instance, only has jurisdiction over crimes committed after the entry into force of the Rome Statute in 2002. 4. Dissolution and Succession: The state of Portugal as it existed during the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade is not the same legal entity as modern Portugal. Questions of state succession and responsibility might arise regarding whether and how the modern state could be held responsible for acts committed by its predecessor. Considering these factors, it would not be possible under current international law to legally convict Portugal of crimes against humanity regarding the Atlantic Slave Trade. That being said, states that acknowledge historical wrongdoing can engage in reparative actions such as issuing apologies, providing reparations, or commemorating victims, which contribute to reconciliation and recognition of historical injustices."},{"instruction":"Who are the Main states/Nations that created International Law?","output":"International law, as it is known today, evolved from a series of treaties, customs, legal principles, and scholarly works over many centuries. It is the product of various civilizations, legal traditions, and state practices. Its modern form has been shaped by a number of key states and events, especially in Europe following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which laid the foundation for the principles of state sovereignty and non-interference that are central to modern international law. Key contributors to the development of international law include: 1. **European Powers**: During the 17th and 18th centuries, European powers such as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Portugal played a significant role in setting the foundations of what would become international law through their practices and treaties governing war, diplomacy, and colonial conquest. 2. **The United States**: Particularly with the Monroe Doctrine in the 19th century and its subsequent involvement in global affairs, the United States influenced the development of international law, especially in relation to the principles of self-determination and international arbitration. 3. **The League of Nations**: After World War I, the creation of the League of Nations marked a significant step in the development of international legal structures, despite its later failure to prevent another global conflict. 4. **The United Nations**: Following World War II, the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 became a cornerstone for the modern international legal system, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and numerous conventions and declarations such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 5. **Global South Nations**: In the latter half of the 20th century, newly independent nations from Africa, Asia, and Latin America contributed to the principles of decolonization, self-determination, and the restructuring of international economic law, which responded to the realities of a rapidly decolonizing world. 6. **International Conferences and Diplomatic Meetings**: Various international conferences and diplomatic meetings throughout history have established key treaties and conventions that form the backbone of international law, like the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) and various environmental agreements. 7. **Scholars and Legal Practitioners**: Scholars such as Hugo Grotius, often referred to as the \\"father of international law\\", and other legal practitioners and theorists throughout history, have substantially contributed to the theoretical underpinnings of international law. Their writings and teachings still influence legal interpretation and the development of international legal norms. In essence, while European states played a dominant role in the earliest development of international law, its expansion and codification have involved input from a wide range of states and international entities over the years. It is now shaped by a multitude of actors, including states of all sizes, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and individuals. International law continues to evolve in response to new challenges and the changing geopolitical landscape."},{"instruction":"what is the most acepted last human ancestor in the homa phylogeny tree?","output":"The most widely accepted last common ancestor of all modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the hominin phylogeny is an individual belonging to a population of early anatomically modern humans in Africa. Genetic evidence points to the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. The term \\"last common ancestor\\" in the context of human evolution typically refers to the final shared ancestor from which all modern humans (Homo sapiens) are descended, not the last common ancestor of humans and another species such as the Neanderthals or the common ancestor of the entire genus Homo. For the broader genus Homo, the last common ancestor is more speculative and is thought to be an early Homo species from which later species like Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens evolved. Scientists continue to debate and study the fossil record and genetic data to better understand this aspect of human ancestry. The last common ancestor for humans and our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos, is not part of the genus Homo but rather a species thought to have lived around 5-7 million years ago. The exact identity of this species remains unknown and is the subject of ongoing research. It is important to note that human evolution is not a linear process but a complex tree with many branches, and there may not be a single \\"missing link.\\" Scientists continuously find new fossils that add to our understanding of how different human ancestors are related to one another and to us."},{"instruction":"How many africans were enslev in the Atlantic Slave Trade? How has this impacted Africa?s econic and social development?","output":"The number of Africans enslaved and transported through the Atlantic Slave Trade is subject to ongoing research and debate among historians, with estimates generally ranging between 12 million and 15 million people. However, the total number of individuals affected is likely higher when factoring in those who died during capture and forced marches to slave ports, as well as the untold numbers who perished during the Middle Passage – the horrific sea journey to the Americas. The Atlantic Slave Trade's impact on Africa's economic and social development has been profound and long-lasting: 1. **Demographic Impact**: The removal of a significant portion of the population, particularly healthy young adults who could have contributed to economic production and reproduction, had dire demographic consequences and slowed population growth in affected areas. 2. **Economic Disruption**: The focus on capturing and trading slaves often disrupted traditional economies and redirected resources towards slaving activities. It inhibited the development of a diversified economy in many regions, with long-term negative effects on the overall economic progress of the continent. 3. **Political and Social Destabilization**: The slave trade encouraged warfare and inter-tribal raiding to capture slaves, leading to political instability, the militarization of societies, and the destabilization of established states and social structures. 4. **Cultural Fragmentation**: Numerous cultural groups were torn apart, with members of the same community often ending up in different parts of the Atlantic world, leading to a loss of cultural cohesion and continuity within Africa. 5. **Psychological Trauma**: The violence and brutal conditions of slavery caused considerable psychological trauma, the effects of which would have reverberated throughout communities in Africa and across generations. 6. **Economic Benefit to European Powers**: Conversely, the slave trade contributed significantly to the economic development of European powers and their colonies in the Americas at the expense of African societies. 7. **Colonialism**: The Atlantic Slave Trade laid the groundwork for the later era of European colonization, which would further impact the development trajectories of African states and their integration into the global economy. There have been a number of initiatives to address the lasting impact of the slave trade and colonialism, including debt relief, development aid, and investments in education and infrastructure. However, debates continue on how these past injustices can be properly acknowledged and addressed, and their lingering effects continue to influence the political, economic, and social fabric of African nations."},{"instruction":"How can the Global South gain a unified and strong, even stronger position in the geopolital conzext of international order?","output":"For the Global South—often used to refer to countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania that have historically been marginalized in global affairs—to gain a stronger and more unified position in the geopolitical context of the international order, there are several strategies and avenues that could be pursued: 1. **Regional Integration**: Strengthening regional economic communities and political unions can help countries from the Global South consolidate their economic and political power. Examples include the African Union (AU), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur). These organizations can amplify the collective voice of their member states in global affairs. 2. **Economic Cooperation and Development**: By increasing economic cooperation among themselves, Global South countries can reduce dependency on former colonial powers and the Global North for trade and investment. South-South cooperation can involve collaborative investments, joint ventures, technology transfers, and knowledge sharing. 3. **Joint Negotiation Blocs**: In international forums such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and climate change conferences, countries from the Global South could form negotiation blocs to push for common interests more effectively. Grouping together strengthens their bargaining power and can help counterbalance the influence of more developed countries. 4. **Reform of International Institutions**: Advocating for reform of international institutions to allow for greater representation and influence of Global South countries is essential. This could involve changes in voting rights, leadership positions, and setting agendas within institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and UN Security Council. 5. **Non-Alignment and Strategic Autonomy**: Maintaining non-aligned positions or strategic autonomy allows countries in the Global South to navigate between major powers without being overly reliant on any single one. The Non-Aligned Movement has historically been a collective effort in this direction, although its influence has waned since the Cold War. 6. **Cultural and Educational Exchanges**: Promoting cultural and educational exchanges among countries of the Global South can strengthen cultural ties and increase mutual understanding, which in turn can reinforce political and economic partnerships. 7. **Investment in Education and Innovation**: By focusing on education, scientific research, and technological innovation, countries can develop their own skilled workforces and economic competitiveness, reducing dependency on external expertise and technology. 8. **Leveraging Natural Resources**: Many countries in the Global South are rich in natural resources. Effectively managing and leveraging these resources can enhance their economic position and provide resources for development. 9. **Diaspora Engagement**: Engaging their diasporas can help Global South countries to access investments, skills, and advocacy networks that can enhance their position in the global order. 10. **Solidarity on Global Issues**: Presenting a unified stance on global issues, such as climate change, can increase the leverage of Global South countries and compel wealthier nations to address concerns that affect the rest of the world. However, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of interests, cultures, political systems, and economic development levels within the Global South. This heterogeneity can make it challenging to form a singular bloc with shared objectives. Successful cooperation thus requires identifying common goals and compromises that reflect the interests of a broad coalition of states."},{"instruction":"What are the common goals and compromises that are feasible for the Global South as to overcame it's marginilazation on Global politics?","output":"To overcome marginalization in global politics, countries of the Global South can focus on a number of common goals and compromises that reflect their shared interests and are feasible given their various contexts. These shared goals often pertain to achieving more equitable economic development, political representation, social progress, and sustainable environmental policies. Here are some potential areas for concerted action: 1. **Sustainable Development**: Advocating for sustainable development that meets the present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This includes ensuring fair access to development financing, technology transfer for sustainable practices, and investment in green energy. 2. **Debt Relief and Financial Justice**: Working collectively to address issues of sovereign debt, unfair loan conditions, and the restructuring of international financial systems that disproportionately affect the Global South. 3. **Trade Equality**: Promoting reforms in the international trade system that mitigate the adversarial effects of protectionist policies and subsidies in developed countries on the economies of developing countries. 4. **Climate Change**: Lobbying for stronger commitments from industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to provide adequate financing for climate change adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable countries. 5. **Healthcare and Pandemic Preparedness**: Cooperating to improve public health systems, access to affordable medicines, and preparedness for future pandemics, as well as campaigning for the waiver of patents for critical drugs and vaccines during global health emergencies. 6. **Peace and Security**: Collaborating to prevent conflicts and promote stability in regions prone to violence, as well as advocating for reform in the international security apparatus to ensure a more representative and fair system. 7. **Reform of International Institutions**: Pushing for more inclusive decision-making processes and representation in international bodies, including the United Nations Security Council, IMF, and World Bank. 8. **Cultural and Educational Collaboration**: Investing in joint cultural and educational programs to foster closer ties, mutual understanding, and shared knowledge, which strengthen the collective human capital and social resilience. 9. **Technology and Innovation**: Encouraging South-South cooperation in science, technology, and innovation to foster the development of local solutions and reduce dependence on technological imports. 10. **Human Rights and Social Justice**: Committing to protect and promote human rights, gender equality, and social justice within and across their borders, advocating for these issues on the international stage. 11. **Agricultural Cooperation**: Sharing knowledge and technology to improve food security and sustainable agricultural practices, as well as working together to combat land degradation and desertification. To effectively pursue these goals, the countries of the Global South may need to make compromises to accommodate their diverse economic structures, political systems, and cultural contexts. By prioritizing flexibility, mutual respect, and the principle of non-interference, these states can address shared challenges collectively while respecting their individual circumstances. Building consensus often requires negotiation and sometimes accepting less-than-ideal outcomes as part of a gradual process toward stronger representation and influence on the global stage."},{"instruction":"Which of the above recomendation has the highest probability of actually happen?","output":"Evaluating the probability of success for any of the above recommendations requires considering various factors such as political will, resources, alignment of interests among a diverse group of nations, and the global geopolitical environment. Some of the recommendations that potentially have a higher chance of materializing include: 1. **Sustainable Development Initiatives**: There is a global consensus on the importance of sustainable development, as evidenced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries in the Global South share a common interest in achieving these goals, which makes collective action in this area more likely. 2. **Climate Change Action**: As some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change are in the Global South, there is a strong impetus for these nations to jointly push for global action, financing, and technology transfer to combat climate change. 3. **Trade Equality**: Many Global South countries are affected by trade barriers and agricultural subsidies in the Global North. There could be a concerted effort to address these challenges through various international forums. The success of such efforts often depends on the ability to negotiate as a bloc. 4. **Healthcare Cooperation**: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for greater collaboration in healthcare, particularly in the areas of vaccine access and distribution. There is a growing recognition of the need for a more equitable global health system, which may push Global South nations to work together. 5. **Agricultural Cooperation**: Food security is a critical concern, and there is already significant engagement in terms of sharing agricultural practices, technology, and research. This type of cooperation could deepen, as it directly impacts national security and economic stability. 6. **Cultural and Educational Collaboration**: Educational and cultural exchanges are relatively less politically charged and can be more readily implemented. Cultural diplomacy and educational partnerships are often seen as win-win initiatives that can be progressively expanded. While all the recommendations hold potential, the realization of each depends on the compatibility of interests among the Global South nations, the prevailing geopolitical dynamics, the responses from the Global North and global institutions, and the presence of strong leadership to drive such initiatives forward. Regardless of the individual likelihood of each action, a unified approach that combines several of these recommendations might stand a better chance of making a meaningful impact in the international order."},{"instruction":"What are the main factors stoping the Global South Achieving these recomendation and how could they be overcomed?","output":"The Global South faces several obstacles in the pursuit of a stronger position in the global political arena and in achieving the above-mentioned recommendations. The main factors impeding their progress and ways to potentially overcome them include: 1. **Economic Disparities**: The Global South encompasses countries with varying levels of economic development, resources, and infrastructure, which can lead to different priorities and capacities for engagement on international issues. - *Overcoming*: Through regional integration and pooling resources, countries can overcome some of these disparities by leveraging their collective economic weight. 2. **Political Instability**: Persistent political instability in some countries of the Global South undermines the ability to form a unified front and to pursue long-term development goals. - *Overcoming*: Establishing and strengthening regional mechanisms for conflict resolution, promoting good governance, and investing in institution-building can create more stable political environments. 3. **Lack of Coordination**: Diverging national interests, cultural differences, and competition among countries can hinder coordinated action. - *Overcoming*: Establishing clear frameworks for cooperation, frequent diplomatic engagements, and focusing on issues with broad consensus can improve coordination. 4. **Dependency on the Global North**: Economic dependency due to trade, investment, and aid from the Global North can limit the autonomy of Global South countries and their bargaining power. - *Overcoming*: Diversifying trade partners, developing local industries, and enhancing South-South cooperation can reduce dependency. 5. **Debt Burden**: High levels of sovereign debt restrict the financial independence of many Global South countries, limiting their policy choices and development funding. - *Overcoming*: Debt restructuring, relief initiatives, and responsible borrowing practices, coupled with efforts to enhance domestic revenue generation, can alleviate debt issues. 6. **External Influence and Intervention**: Geopolitical competition and intervention by powerful states can interfere with the autonomy and collective actions of Global South nations. - *Overcoming*: Pursuing non-aligned and multipolar foreign policies, along with strong regional alliances, can help reduce the impact of external influence. 7. **Limited Influence in International Institutions**: Underrepresentation in decision-making bodies of global institutions often marginalizes the voices of Global South countries. - *Overcoming*: Advocacy for institutional reform and increased representation, as well as leveraging the numbers in entities like the UN General Assembly, can amplify influence. 8. **Climate Change Vulnerability**: Environmental degradation and the disproportionate impact of climate change can strain already scarce resources. - *Overcoming*: Mobilizing international climate finance, investing in adaptation and mitigation strategies, and forming a united front in global climate negotiations can help address climate vulnerability. 9. **Intellectual Property Regimes**: Stringent IP laws can limit access to technology and pharmaceuticals, essential for development and managing healthcare crises. - *Overcoming*: Campaigning for more flexible IP regimes, promoting the transfer of technology, and fostering innovation through regional research collaborations can help overcome these barriers. 10. **Educational and Technical Gaps**: Disparities in education and technology limit human capital development and innovation capacity. - *Overcoming*: Investing in education, fostering technology exchange programs, building regional centers of excellence, and enhancing digital connectivity can bridge these gaps. To overcome these challenges, leadership from within the Global South is crucial. It requires vision, political will, and the ability to prioritize collective long-term benefits over short-term individual gains. A strengthened Global South can then engage with the Global North and international institutions from a position of greater equality and shared interest."},{"instruction":"Give a expert summary of the overcomig part in each of the point mentioned. sumarize in detail paragraphs.","output":"Sure, here's a detailed summary of potential strategies to overcome the challenges faced by the Global South in achieving a stronger presence in global politics and development: **Overcoming Economic Disparities**: The economic divergence within the Global South can be mitigated through regional integration efforts and collaborative financial strategies. Economic blocs that facilitate trade agreements, joint ventures, and infrastructure projects allow for pooling of resources, which can elevate the collective bargaining power of the countries involved. Initiatives like the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) aim to enhance economic integration and development within regions of the Global South. **Addressing Political Instability**: To address political instability, countries can focus on building stronger regional institutions that promote political cooperation and conflict resolution. Investment in governance reforms, education, and civil society can help nurture stable and resilient state institutions. Regional bodies like ECOWAS in West Africa have played significant roles in addressing political crises and promoting stability. **Enhancing Coordination**: Divergent national agendas pose a challenge to collective action, but they can be aligned through regular intergovernmental dialogue and by identifying common goals. Transparent mechanisms that encourage information exchange and consensus-building are crucial in fostering a sense of shared purpose and direction. The G77 plus China, a coalition of developing nations, exemplifies an effort to coordinate policy positions on economic matters within the UN system. **Reducing Dependency on the Global North**: To achieve greater independence from the Global North, the Global South must diversify its economic partners and foster intra-regional trade. Creating an enabling environment for local industries and investing in human capital can also drive innovation and build resilient economies. The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA) serves as an example of a South-South cooperative agreement aiming to reduce economic dependence and promote mutual development. **Alleviating the Debt Burden**: Excessive debt undermines fiscal sovereignty and development. Engaging in collective negotiations for more favorable debt restructuring and advocating for fairer lending practices are ways to ease debt burdens. Debt-for-development swaps, where debt is forgiven in exchange for investments in local development projects, is a tool that has been used with some success. **Countering External Influence and Intervention**: Non-aligned movements and a multipolar approach to foreign policy can help negate the dominance of external powers. Strong regional partnerships that provide mutual support and defense of sovereignty are critical. The ASEAN's unified approach to external powers is an example where regional solidarity minimizes external influence. **Increasing Influence in International Institutions**: Gaining greater representation in international bodies requires concerted diplomatic campaigns and leveraging collective voting power. Using numerical strength within bodies like the UN General Assembly can push for changes in governance structures to allow for more equitable decision-making processes. **Responding to Climate Change Vulnerability**: The Global South can advance its interests by forming negotiation blocs during international climate discussions to ensure that their concerns are addressed. Accessing climate finance from global institutions and investing in localized adaptation measures will be critical for resilience. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has been influential in advocating for the concerns of small island and low-lying coastal developing states. **Navigating Intellectual Property Regimes**: Intellectual property laws that restrict access to essential technologies must be addressed through campaigns for more equitable IP policies. Promoting knowledge sharing, generic production of vital medicines, and the use of compulsory licensing where permitted under international agreements can allow for increased technological and pharmaceutical access. **Bridging Educational and Technical Gaps**: Investing in education is fundamental to developing a skilled workforce able to innovate and compete globally. Programs that enhance technical capacity and digital inclusion can leverage human capital as a transformative resource. Collaborative research initiatives and technology exchange with countries at the forefront of innovation can help close the developmental gap. By adopting a multifaceted approach that addresses both the internal and external factors limiting their growth and representation, countries in the Global South can work towards overcoming marginalization and achieving a position of greater strength and influence on the world stage."},{"instruction":"Can. the westafford an Independent Africa? How much does Africa contributes for European GDF?","output":"The question of whether \\"the West can afford an independent Africa\\" stems from historical contexts where many African nations were under European colonial rule, and their economies were tightly integrated into those of the colonial powers. However, in today's international order, African nations are independent and their relationships with European countries are based on diplomatic, economic, and development partnerships rather than colonial dependencies. Africa's contribution to European GDP is not a straightforward figure to quantify, as the economic relationship is complex and multifaceted, including trade, investment, and aid. Here is some context: 1. **Trade**: African countries export a range of goods to Europe, including raw materials, agricultural products, and, increasingly, manufactured goods. European countries export machinery, vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and more to Africa. The trade relationship is significant but is only a portion of Europe's overall trade. 2. **Investment**: European investments in Africa contribute to Europe's GDP by potentially providing returns in the form of profits from businesses and projects in Africa. European investors often focus on sectors such as mining, oil and gas, agriculture, telecommunications, and manufacturing. 3. **Aid and Development Funding**: European nations provide a substantial amount of aid and development funding to African countries. This funding is often aimed at improving governance, health, education, and infrastructure on the continent, which can, in turn, create opportunities for European businesses and can sometimes support Europe's strategic interests. 4. **Remittance**: Africans living and working in European countries send remittances back home, which significantly support many African economies but do not directly contribute to European GDP. As for the concept of an \\"independent Africa,\\" it's important to clarify that the nations within Africa are already politically independent. However, the economic independence of African nations can be constrained by numerous factors such as debt, dependence on exports of raw materials, the legacies of historical trade relationships, and economic conditions attached to financing and aid. From the European perspective, an economically strong and politically stable Africa can be beneficial in several ways: - Increased trade opportunities with a rising consumer market. - Political stability in Africa, which can help reduce mass migration pressures and security concerns. - Investment opportunities in fast-growing economies. - Stronger global partnerships to tackle transnational issues such as climate change, health pandemics, and terrorism. Ultimately, \\"affording\\" is not just about economics; it's about fostering a geopolitical environment in which all regions, including the nations of Africa, can interact on a basis of mutual respect and benefit. The success of African countries in achieving sustainable and equitable growth is in the interest of the global community, including Europe, for ensuring regional stability, global economic prosperity, and addressing shared global challenges."},{"instruction":"What was the total amount of aid in dollar the european union as a whole gave to Africa in 2022?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, the exact total amount of aid that the European Union provided to Africa for the year 2022 may not have been fully compiled and officially released, as such financial reports often take time to be aggregated and published. The European Union, as one of the world’s largest aid donors, provides a significant amount of development assistance to African countries, but this assistance is delivered through various channels, including direct aid from the EU budget, contributions from individual member states, and European development finance institutions. Aid from the EU is directed towards various sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, governance, and economic development. The European Development Fund (EDF) and the recently established European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) are some of the key instruments through which the EU channels its development aid to Africa. To find the specific amount of aid contributed by the European Union to Africa in 2022, you would generally refer to the annual reports from the European Commission, data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), or specific reports from individual EU institutions responsible for development cooperation. It's also worth noting that because development finance often involves multi-year programs and commitments, annual figures can fluctuate based on project cycles and specific initiatives. For the most up-to-date and accurate figures, you should consult the latest reports and financial statements from the European Union or official publications from the EU's development cooperation bodies after the data for 2022 becomes available."},{"instruction":"Can you then tell me the specific amount of aid contributed by the European Union to Africa in 2020","output":"I do not have access to real-time databases or the ability to fetch live information as of my last update. For specific amounts of aid contributed by the European Union to Africa in 2020, you would typically need to refer to official reports and data released by the European Union or organizations that track international development assistance, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The European Union, as a significant donor, provides a combination of development aid, humanitarian assistance, and funding towards various initiatives and partnerships in Africa through its institutions and member states. Each year, the EU publishes details of its Official Development Assistance (ODA), which encompasses various forms of aid. For the most accurate and detailed data on EU aid contributions to Africa in 2020, you would need to consult resources such as: - European Commission financial reports. - The annual report on the implementation of the EU's External Action instruments. - OECD's International Development Statistics (IDS) online databases which provide comprehensive data on where aid goes, what purposes it serves, and what policies it is aimed to implement. If specific financial data for 2020 is needed, you can seek out the \\"2020 Annual Report on the EU's Development and External Assistance Policies and their Implementation,\\" or an equivalent report, which should detail the funds allocated and spent in Africa during that fiscal year. The EU's official website and its Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO) would be where such reports are typically published."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

List as many topics as you can that match the Enduring Understandings. Each topic within each unit needs to have a title that encapsulate the content of each of the Topic Titles, Learning Objectives, Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledge statements. Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students. Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings. Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/MENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam.TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas.TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.)TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles.TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons.TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°.ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.A Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. TOPIC 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures.

SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture.

SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.TOPIC 3.10 Solubility Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.A Explain the relationship between a region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the types of molecular or electronic transitions associated with that region. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.B Represent changes in matter with a balanced chemical or net ionic equation: a. For physical changes. b. For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction.

TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. TOPIC 4.5 Stoichiometry Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-2 A substance can change into another substance through different processes, and the change itself can be classified by the sort of processes that produced it. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas.

TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy.

ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system.

ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.F Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a chemical reaction in relationship to the amount of the reacting substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of reaction. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.B Calculate the enthalpy change for a chemical or physical process based on the standard enthalpies of formation. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.A Explain the relationship between the occurrence of a reversible chemical or physical process, and the establishment of equilibrium, to experimental observations. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.A Represent the reaction quotient Qc p or Q , for a reversible reaction, and the corresponding equilibrium expressions Kc = Qc or K p = Qp . TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.B Calculate Kc or K p based on experimental observations of concentrations or pressures at equilibrium. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.C Explain the relationship between very large or very small values of K and the relative concentrations of chemical species at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.D Represent a multistep process with an overall equilibrium expression, using the constituent K expressions for each individual reaction. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.E Identify the concentrations or partial pressures of chemical species at equilibrium based on the initial conditions and the equilibrium constant. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.F Represent a system undergoing a reversible reaction with a particulate model. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-8 Systems at equilibrium respond to external stresses to offset the effect of the stress. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.A Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Châtelier’s principle. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.A Calculate the solubility of a salt based on the value of K sp for the salt. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.B Identify the solubility of a salt, and/or the value of K sp for the salt, based on the concentration of a common ion already present in solution. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.C Identify the qualitative effect of changes in pH on the solubility of a salt. SPQ-5.C.1 The solubility of a salt is pH sensitive when one of the constituent ions is a weak acid or base. These effects can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.A Calculate the values of pH and pOH, based on Kw and the concentration of all species present in a neutral solution of water. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.B Calculate pH and pOH based on concentrations of all species in a solution of a strong acid or a strong base. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.C Explain the relationship among pH, pOH, and concentrations of all species in a solution of a monoprotic weak acid or weak base. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka c SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.D Explain the relationship among the concentrations of major species in a mixture of weak and strong acids and bases. SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.E Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components. SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.D Calculate the amount of charge flow based on changes in the amounts of reactants and products in an electrochemical cell. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e. Charge of ionic species EQN: I = q/t","output":"Wow, that's quite an extensive curriculum!

With Wilson's death, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall assumes the presidency but struggles to maintain Wilson's policies. A Republican surge in the November elections brings into power an administration determined to root out perceived foreign threats. 1917: The new Republican administration in the U.S. uncovers a covert British operation aimed at influencing American politics and potentially balkanizing the country. This, combined with intercepted communications revealing Entente support for anti-American factions within the U.S., including the Democrat Party and Ku Klux Klan, fuels a drastic shift in foreign policy. 1917: In response to the perceived betrayal by the Entente, the United States announces its entry into the Weltkrieg on the side of the Central Powers, providing them with much-needed assistance against the British, French, and their allies. 1918: The Zimmerman Telegram, originally intended for Mexico, is mistakenly intercepted by Japan, which perceives an opportunity to expand its influence. Japan switches sides in the conflict after negotiations with Germany, and the Central Powers bolster their forces in the Far East. 1919: With American military support, Japan aids the Beiyang Government in China to defeat Sun Yat-sen's Republicans in the National Protection War. The Beiyang Government consolidates its power, with Yuan Shikai as its leader, while Japan establishes puppet states in Manchuria (Manchukuo) and Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang). 1920: Under pressure from the United States, which seeks stability in China, Yuan Shikai agrees to transition from a military dictatorship to a constitutional monarchy. The new government is structured to provide a balance of power with Yuan as a figurehead emperor. 1921: To legitimate the new monarchy and placate the population yearning for historical continuity, Yuan Shikai's son, Yuan Keding, willingly abdicates the throne in favor of a descendant of the Ming Dynasty's imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, following American insistence and historical claims dating back to the Xinhai Revolution. 1921: The re-establishment of the Ming Dynasty in China is met with mixed reactions but ultimately grants the Chinese government a semblance of historical legitimacy. The world watches as the ancient imperial line is restored in a modern constitutional context. 1922: With this new balance of power in Asia and the shock of the United States joining the Central Powers, the Weltkrieg reaches a stalemate, dragging on with increasing loss of life and no decisive victory in sight. Diplomatic channels remain open but the path to peace is fraught with national pride and the thirst for retribution. 1923: The protracted war and the revolution in China start influencing colonial subjects around the world, leading to the ignition of independence movements and the spread of anti-colonial sentiments throughout the European empires, further straining the resources of the Entente Powers. The effects of these significant political and military shifts continue to impact global dynamics, leading to a world vastly different from the one we know, where the power balance in Asia is altered and the United States takes on a new role in global geopolitics following its unexpected alliance during the Weltkrieg."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Bu devreler radyo, televizyon yayıncılığı, sinyal işleme ve telekomünikasyon gibi pek çok alanda kullanılmaktadır. Osilasyon devrelerinin temel öğelerinden biri de rezonans fenomenidir. Rezonans, sistemlerin belirli bir frekansta maksimum enerji transferine uğradığı ve amplitüdün tepe yaptığı bir fenomendir. Bu makalede, osilasyon devrelerindeki rezonans frekansının temel prensipleri ve önemi açıklanacak. Temel Kavramlar # LC Rezonans Devresi İdeal bir LC rezonans devresi bir indüktör (L) ve bir kapasitör (C) elemanı içerir. Kapasitör yüklenirken enerjiyi elektrik alanında saklar, indüktör ise enerjiyi manyetik alanında saklar. Devrede akımın yönü değiştiği zaman bu enerjiler birbirine dönüşür. Enerji kaybının olmadığı ideal bir durumda, bu enerji dönüşümü sonsuza dek sürebilir ve bu sisteme “rezonans” adı verilir. # Rezonans Frekansı (f₀) LC devresinde rezonans frekansı, kapasitör ve indüktör elemanlarının reaktanslarının büyüklük olarak birbirine eşit olduğu ve birbirlerini iptal ettiği frekanstır. Bu frekansta, devrenin empedansı minimuma iner ve sistem maksimum akımı geçirir. Rezonans frekansı (f₀) aşağıdaki formülle hesaplanır: f₀ = 1 / (2π√LC) Burada L indüktans (H - Henry), C ise kapasitans (F - Farad) değeridir. # Kalite Faktörü (Q) Kalite faktörü (Q), rezonansın “keskinliğini” ifade eder ve çevreyle olan enerji kaybını gösterir. Yüksek bir Q faktörüne sahip sistem daha az enerji kaybına ve dar bir frekans bandına işaret eder. Kalite faktörü aşağıdaki formülle hesaplanabilir: Q = f₀ / bant genişliği Yüksek Q faktörü, sistemdeki osilasyonların daha uzun süre devam ettiğini ve enerji kaybının daha yavaş olduğunu gösterir. Osilasyon Devrelerinde Rezonansın Önemi 1. **Verici ve Alıcı Devrelerde Seçicilik**: Rezonans devreleri, radyo frekansı verici ve alıcılarında belirli bir frekanstaki sinyallerin seçilmesinde kullanılır. Bu sayede istenen sinyallerin alınması ve istenmeyen sinyallerin bloke edilmesi sağlanır. 2. **Sinyal Güçlendirme**: Rezonans sırasında, elektromanyetik enerji minimum kayıpla transfer edilir. Bu durum, sinyal güçlendiricilerde verimliliği ve performansı artırır. 3. **Filtreleme**: Rezonans devreleri, frekans filtreleme işlemlerinde temel bileşendir. Örneğin, bant geçiren, bant kesen, yüksek geçiren ve düşük geçiren filtreler rezonans fenomeninden faydalanır. 4. **Frekans Sentezi ve Kararlılık**: Osilatörlerdeki rezonans devreleri, stabil bir referans frekansı oluşturmak için kullanılır. Saatler, mikroişlemciler ve haberleşme sistemlerinde bu referans frekanslar kritik öneme sahiptir. 5. **Elektrik Rezonansı**: Güç sistemlerinde, rezonans devreleri elektirk rezonansını kontrol etmek için kullanılır. Bu yönetim, sistemdeki enerji dağılımını optimize eder ve verimliliği artırır. Sonuç Rezonans frekansı, osilasyon devrelerinin temel yapı taşıdır ve elektronik sistemlerde pek çok mümkün olan uygulamanın temelini oluşturur. Mühendisler, rezonans frekansının kontrolü ve yönetimiyle ilgili prensipleri anlayarak yüksek performanslı ve verimli elektronik devreler tasarlarlar. Yeni malzemelerin ve teknolojilerin gelişimi ile birlikte rezonans fenomeninin kullanım alanlarının genişleyeceği ve bu prensiplerin daha da geliştirileceği öngörülmektedir."},{"instruction":"osilasyon devresinde rezonans frekansı ile ilgili paragraf şeklinde bir makale yaz","output":"Osilasyon devreleri, elektrik ve elektronik mühendisliğinde temel bir rol oynar ve bu devreler, enerjinin bir elektriksel formdan diğerine etkin bir şekilde dönüştürülmesini sağlar. Bu devrelerin çalışma prensiplerinden bir tanesi rezonans fenomenidir, ki bu olay sayesinde devreler, sistemlerin maksimum enerji aktarımı sağladığı rezonans frekansında daha etkili bir şekilde işlev görebilir. Rezonans frekansı, bir indüktör (L) ve bir kapasitör (C)'ün birleştirilmesiyle oluşturulan LC devresinde, her iki elemanın da reaktanslarının eşit ve zıt işaretli olması durumunda meydana gelen özgül bir frekanstır. Bu frekansta, indüktör ve kapasitör arasındaki enerji transferi en verimli noktadadır, çünkü enerji kaybı en aza indirgenir ve bu durum, akımın amplitüdünün maksimize olmasına olanak tanır. Rezonans frekansı, f₀ = 1 / (2π√LC) formülü kullanılarak hesaplanabilir ve bu frekans, sistemlerin belirli uygulamalarda maksimum verimlilikte çalışmasını sağlamak için kritik öneme sahiptir. Özellikle radyo ve telekomünikasyon endüstrilerinde, sinyal seçiciliği ve güçlendirilmesi için bu prensip büyük değer taşır. Günümüz teknolojilerinde ise rezonans frekansı, hassas filtreleme ve frekans stabilizasyonu gibi pek çok alanda vazgeçilmezdir.

Bu iki bileşenin serbestçe enerji alışverişi yapabildiği frekansta, sistem rezonansa ulaşır. İşte rezonans frekansının oluşma sebepleri: # Kapasitör ve Elektrik Alanının Özellikleri Bir kapasitör, elektrik yüklerini depolayarak elektrik enerjisini potansiyel enerji formunda saklar. Kapasitör şarj olduğunda, bir yüzeyde pozitif diğer yüzeyde negatif yük birikintisi oluşur ve bu birikinti arasında bir elektrik alanı mevcuttur. Kapasitör deşarj edildiğinde, bu birikintideki yükler serbestçe akarak enerjiyi serbest bırakır. Bu işlem, bir kapasitörün yükseltilmiş bir potansiyel enerji durumundan enerjiyi serbest bırakarak düşük bir potansiyel enerji durumuna geçiş yapmasıdır. # İndüktör ve Manyetik Alanının Özellikleri Bir indüktör ise, üzerine akım geçtiğinde bir manyetik alan oluşturur ve başka bir deyişle enerjiyi manyetik alan formunda depolar. Akım kesildiğinde, manyetik alan çöker ve etrafındaki iletkenlerde indüklenmiş bir akım oluşturur. Bu indüklenmiş akım, manyetik alan enerjisinin elektrik enerjisine dönüşümünü simgeler. # Rezonansın Oluşumu Osilasyon devresinde, bir kapasitör ve indüktör seri veya paralel bağlandığında, devrede akım akışı oluşur. Deşarj olan kapasitör, indüktör üzerinden akım akışını sağlar ve bu sırada indüktör üzerinde bir manyetik alan oluşturur. Kapasitör tamamen deşarj olduğunda, indüktör de daha önce depoladığı enerjiyi, elektrik alan formunda kapasitöre geri besler ve onu tekrar şarj eder. Bu enerji alışverişi sürekli olarak devam eder ve sistemde bir salınım oluşur. Rezonans frekansında, bu salınımlar doğal frekansta ve minimum enerji kaybıyla meydana gelir. # Rezonans Frekansının Matematiksel Tanımı Rezonans, kapasitörün reaktansı (X_C) ile indüktörün reaktansı (X_L) arasındaki etkileşimden doğar ve bu iki reaktansın büyüklükleri eşit olduğunda gerçekleşir: X_C = 1 / (ωC) X_L = ωL Rezonansta bu iki büyüklük birbirine eşittir: X_L = X_C Bu durum ω = 2πf_optional için gerçekleşir ve böylece rezonans frekansı (f_optional), kapasitör (C) ve indüktör (L) değerlerine bağlı olarak şu formülle bulunur: f_optional = 1 / (2π√LC) # Enerjinin Korunumu ve İdeal Rezonans Enerjinin korunum yasası çerçevesinde, ideal bir LC devresinde (direnç yok sayıldığında) enerji sürekli olarak kapasitör ile indüktör arasında dönüşür ve bu sistem sonsuza kadar salınıma devam edebilir. Ancak gerçek dünyada dirençlerin varlığından dolayı rezonansta bile küçük de olsa enerji kayıpları yaşanır. Bu nedenle gerçek sistemlerde kalite faktörü (Q) gibi parametreler devreye girer ve devrenin ne kadar “iyi” rezonans yaptığını belirlemek için kullanılır. Osilasyon devrelerinde rezonans frekansı, bu enerji alışverişinin en verimli şekilde gerçekleştiği, enerji kaybının en aza indirgendiği ve sistem dinamiklerinin kendi içinde en uyumlu olduğu bir noktayı belirler. Bu frekansta devre, içerisinden geçen akımın maksimum amplitüde ulaşmasını sağlar ve bu da osilasyon devrelerinin birçok uygulamada kritik performans sergilemesine olanak tanır."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Let's examine the components and their associated functions: 1. **Role-based Access Control** - \`grantRole(bytes32, address)\`: Allows granting a role to an account, but only if the sender has the admin role for the given role being granted. Ensuring that role administration is properly managed is important to prevent unauthorized access. - \`revokeRole(bytes32, address)\`: Allows revoking a role from an account, with the same permissions check as \`grantRole\`. It's critical to ensure that only authorized accounts can revoke roles. - \`renounceRole(bytes32)\`: Allows an account to renounce its own role. A potential concern here is if an admin renounces their role accidentally, which could lead to loss of access control functionality. 2. **Modifiers** - \`onlyRole(bytes32)\`: A security feature that restricts function calls to accounts with a specific role. The use of this modifier in sensitive functions is a good protection measure. - \`onlyAdmin\`: Presumably, this modifier restricts function calls to accounts with the admin role. It's used for pausing and unpausing the contract, which is crucial to be protected to avoid malicious pause/unpause actions. - \`whenNotPaused\` and \`whenPaused\`: Ensures that certain functions can only be called based on the contract’s paused state. Need to make sure the pause state can't be toggled inappropriately. 3. **State-Changing Functions & Access Control** - \`pause()\` and \`unpause()\`: These functions change the contract's paused state. It is essential that there are no vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized users to pause or unpause the contract, disrupting the normal operation. 4. **Pausable State Management** - \`paused()\`: A view function providing the paused state. Should be harmless as it's only for reading state. Vulnerability Areas to Check: - **Role Administration**: Ensure that role administration functions are protected and cannot be called by unauthorized parties. - **Input Validation**: Verify that all external inputs, such as roles and addresses, are validated where necessary. - **Access Control Checks**: Make sure access-controlled functions enforce their restrictions correctly. - **Modifiers**: Examine custom modifiers for any logic mistakes that could lead to a breach in the intended access control. - **Contract Upgradeability (if applicable)**: If the contract is upgradeable, make sure that the upgrade mechanisms are secured effectively. - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Consider whether the contract is vulnerable to being locked by a user in a certain role. If someone with a critical role, like the admin, can accidentally or maliciously lock down the contract, the whole system can be affected. - **Pause/Unpause Logic**: Confirm the conditions under which these states can be toggled are secure and cannot be exploited. Testing and Formal Verification: - Test the contract thoroughly with different scenarios including edge cases. - Harness tools like Slither or MythX for static code analysis. - Engage in formal verification where possible to attest to the correctness of the contract. Outside of technical vulnerabilities, it's also crucial to consider best practices around governance and social engineering, as role-based systems are also susceptible to threats not present in the code itself."},{"instruction":"Issue 1: Reentrancy Attack The _checkAndApplyIncentives function indeed calls external contracts, which is a common point of vulnerability for reentrancy attacks. To mitigate this, Solidity offers a reentrancy guard pattern, typically implemented as a modifier that prevents a function from being called multiple times in a single transaction. We should check if such a guard is implemented or suggest adding one. Issue 2: Incorrect Access Control The setIncentiveContract function requires the caller to have the GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE. It's crucial to ensure that the roles are assigned correctly and that the access control logic is robust. An audit of the access control system, including a review of how roles are granted and revoked, would be necessary to confirm its security. Issue 3: Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts To prevent arbitrary code execution, it's important to have a whitelist of approved incentive contracts or a review process for adding new incentive contracts. This ensures that only trusted contracts can be interacted with. Issue 4: Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts Handling the failure of external calls is essential. One approach is to use a try/catch block around the external call to prevent the entire transaction from reverting. Alternatively, a circuit breaker pattern could be implemented to disable incentive logic in case of consistent failures. Issue 5: Unauthorized Upgrade Attack The _authorizeUpgrade function should be protected by a strong access control mechanism. It's important to ensure that only a multisig or a DAO with a proven governance model can authorize upgrades. An audit trail of the upgrade process and a time lock for upgrade proposals can also add layers of security. For each of these issues, we should verify if the contract has the necessary safeguards in place and suggest improvements if needed. Would you like to proceed with a more detailed review or focus on implementing specific security features?","output":"It looks like you are discussing a different context and contract than the code you've initially provided. Nonetheless, these issues are relevant for smart contract security and can be addressed in a general sense. Let's go through the issues you've listed: **Issue 1: Reentrancy Attack** - To mitigate reentrancy attacks, implementing a nonreentrant modifier is crucial. Ensure that functions making external calls to untrusted contracts or handling Ether transfers use this modifier to prevent recursive calls. - Check if the function \`_checkAndApplyIncentives\` (not provided in your initial code) or any other function that interacts with external contracts has a reentrancy guard in place. **Issue 2: Incorrect Access Control** - Review the role management to ensure that only authorized accounts can assign the \`GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE\`. - Verify the implementation of role-based access control and validate that the mechanisms for granting and revoking roles are secure. - Ensure that there is no central point of failure where a single account has excessive control over the system. **Issue 3: Arbitrary Code Execution via Incentive Contracts** - To avoid arbitrary code execution by malicious contracts, implement a whitelist of approved contracts. - Ensure that there's a secure process for reviewing and approving new incentive contracts. - Consider using proxy patterns like the \`TransparentProxy\` or \`UUPS\` (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard), with controlled \`delegatecall\`s to trusted implementations. **Issue 4: Denial of Service via Incentive Contracts** - Use a try/catch block around external calls to prevent the entire transaction from reverting upon failure of external contract calls. - Implement a circuit breaker pattern to disable functionalities in emergency situations or when persistent failures are detected. **Issue 5: Unauthorized Upgrade Attack** - Secure the \`_authorizeUpgrade\` function with strong access control checks. Make sure that upgrading the contract is a guarded, multi-step process that involves multiple parties or uses a time lock. - Employ a governance mechanism like a multisig wallet or DAO, which requires consensus for critical actions such as contract upgrades. - Keep an audit trail that is transparent and provides evidence of all significant actions such as upgrades. For each of these issues, consider the following steps: 1. **Code Review**: Conduct a line-by-line review of the smart contract code to identify and address any security concerns. 2. **Use Tools**: Leverage static analysis tools (e.g., Slither, MythX) and run comprehensive test suites including unit and integration tests. 3. **External Audit**: Engage with an external security firm to audit the contract, especially if it handles a significant value or is complex. 4. **Bug Bounties**: Encourage community participation by running a bug bounty program to discover vulnerabilities. If you would like to implement specific security features or proceed with a more tailored review, please provide more context or direct code examples related to the issues you have raised."},{"instruction":"parts of the contract are most criticalv // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.19; import {IAccessControl} from \\"../interfaces/IAccessControl.sol\\"; import {AccessControlInternal} from \\"../access/AccessControlInternal.sol\\"; import {LibAccessControl} from \\"../libraries/LibAccessControl.sol\\"; import {Modifiers} from \\"../libraries/LibAppStorage.sol\\"; /** * @notice Role-based access control facet * @dev Derived from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts (MIT license) * @dev https://github.com/solidstate-network/solidstate-solidity/blob/master/contracts/access/access_control/AccessControl.sol */ contract AccessControlFacet is Modifiers, IAccessControl, AccessControlInternal { /// @inheritdoc IAccessControl function grantRole( bytes32 role, address account ) external onlyRole(_getRoleAdmin(role)) { return _grantRole(role, account); } /// @inheritdoc IAccessControl function hasRole( bytes32 role, address account ) external view returns (bool) { return _hasRole(role, account); } /// @inheritdoc IAccessControl function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32) { return _getRoleAdmin(role); } /// @inheritdoc IAccessControl function revokeRole( bytes32 role, address account ) external onlyRole(_getRoleAdmin(role)) { return _revokeRole(role, account); } /// @inheritdoc IAccessControl function renounceRole(bytes32 role) external { return _renounceRole(role); } /// @notice Returns true if the contract is paused and false otherwise function paused() public view returns (bool) { return LibAccessControl.paused(); } /// @notice Pauses the contract function pause() external whenNotPaused onlyAdmin { LibAccessControl.pause(); } /// @notice Unpauses the contract function unpause() external whenPaused onlyAdmin { LibAccessControl.unpause(); } }","output":"In the \`AccessControlFacet\` contract, the most critical parts are the ones dealing with access control logic and state alteration capabilities. These areas if compromised, could lead to unauthorized system behavior or loss of funds. Specifically, the functions and components to review closely are: 1. **Role Management Functions** - \`grantRole(bytes32, address)\`: The ability to assign roles to various addresses is critical, as roles can confer significant powers. It's protected by the \`onlyRole\` modifier, which checks that the sender has the admin role for the role being granted. Evaluate the associated role management to prevent unauthorized granting of roles. - \`revokeRole(bytes32, address)\`: The ability to revoke a role is also sensitive and contains similar protections to \`grantRole\`. 2. **Role Renunciation** - \`renounceRole(bytes32)\`: This function allows an address to give up a role voluntarily. This is a self-restricting action, but it's critical to prevent accidental renunciation of crucial roles, like the admin role, which could lead to a lockout from key admin functionalities. 3. **Pause Functionality** - \`pause()\` and \`unpause()\`: These functions control the paused state of the contract, potentially freezing all actions that are guarded by \`whenPaused\` and \`whenNotPaused\` modifiers. Robust access control for these functions is vital to prevent unauthorized pausing or unpausing of the contract. 4. **Modifiers** - \`onlyRole(bytes32)\`: A critical modifier that conditions the execution of role-specific functionality. It's important to validate its correct implementation. - \`onlyAdmin\`: It is assumed this modifier restricts function execution to those with admin rights, thus validating its correct application and implementation is necessary. - \`whenNotPaused\` and \`whenPaused\`: These modifiers help guard against state changes when the contract is paused or when it needs to be paused/unpaused. Making sure these modifiers are properly applied to sensitive functions is imperative. 5. **Library Calls** - \`LibAccessControl.paused()\`, \`LibAccessControl.pause()\`, and \`LibAccessControl.unpause()\`: Since they are involved in pausing and unpausing the contract, it's crucial to verify the libraries for any potential vulnerabilities, especially if state changes in the library affect the contract's pause state. 6. **Access to \`LibAccessControl\` States** - Direct access to library states should be restricted. Typically, libraries define internal functions to be used by contracts. Ensure that crucial state variables like paused states are not directly accessible by other contracts or via public/external functions, unless explicitly intended. To summarize, pay particular attention to any function that changes critical roles or states, especially those related to pausing/unpausing the contract and granting/revoking roles. Ensuring that the \`onlyAdmin\` and \`onlyRole\` modifiers are applied consistently and correctly is as important as ensuring that the conditions and effects that these modifiers protect are the intended ones. Robust testing, code review, and potentially an audit, particularly focusing on these critical parts, is advised before deploying the contract or updating its logic."},{"instruction":"revokeRole and renounceRole to the diagram. Could you provide more details on the checks and interactions within these functions?","output":"Certainly! Let's delve into the \`revokeRole\` and \`renounceRole\` functions and their interactions and checks. # revokeRole Function The purpose of the \`revokeRole\` function is to remove a role from an address. Here are its interactions and checks: 1. **Access Control Check**: - \`onlyRole(_getRoleAdmin(role))\`: This modifier is a critical check that restricts the function's execution to the senders who have the role administrator privileges for the role they are trying to revoke. This prevents unauthorized addresses from revoking roles. 2. **Internal Call to Library Function**: - \`_revokeRole(role, account)\`: Inside this function, there will be logic that performs the actual revocation of the role. Usually, this entails removing the address from the set of addresses mapped to this role in the contract's or library's state. # renounceRole Function The \`renounceRole\` function allows an address to voluntarily relinquish a role it currently has. Here are the interactions and checks specific to it: 1. **Direct Interaction**: - Unlike \`grantRole\` and \`revokeRole\`, \`renounceRole\` usually does not have an access control modifier because the check is inherently self-imposed—the sender of the transaction is renouncing a role that it has. 2. **Internal Call to Library Function**: - \`_renounceRole(role)\`: This function executes the logic for the sender to give up the specified role. Since a renouncing action is less sensitive than granting or revoking (because it's self-restricting), it frequently involves simpler logic. # Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigations While \`revokeRole\` and \`renounceRole\` functions may seem straightforward, there are potential vulnerabilities and necessary mitigations to consider: - **Role Admin Management**: Ensure that only trusted accounts have the role admin privileges; otherwise, they could maliciously revoke roles from rightful role bearers. - **Proper Authorization**: It’s vital for the \`revokeRole\` function to properly check that the caller has the corresponding role admin access; otherwise, anyone could revoke roles. - **Self-Lock Prevention**: When implementing \`renounceRole\`, it is crucial to prevent critical roles, like the default admin role, from accidentally losing all its members which can cause a lockout from key functionalities. - **Event Emission**: Both functions should emit events upon successful revocation/renunciation to ensure transparency and a clear audit trail. - **State Consistency**: Ensure state changes are atomic within these functions to prevent inconsistencies in the case of transaction reversion. - **Function Visibility**: \`renounceRole\` should be an external function since it’s expected to be called by externally-owned accounts, not by the contract itself. In summary, \`revokeRole\` and \`renounceRole\` are critical functions for managing the role-based access control in a contract. Hence, thorough testing, code audits, and possibly adding a few additional checks (like preventing admins from revoking their own admin privileges if they are the last admins) are recommended to maintain contract integrity and avoid unintended loss of control."},{"instruction":"¿Tiene autoridad la guardia civil en el territorio de las bardenas reales?","output":"Las Bardenas Reales es un paraje natural semidesértico de unas 42.000 hectáreas que se sitúa en el sureste de Navarra (España).

Indicators of this sort are used to analyze and predict market behavior based on historical data. The script seems to draw on price action and other filters to identify market cycles and provide buy or sell signals. Here is an analysis of the most significant elements of the indicator: 1. **Meta Information:** - \`#property\` items define the characteristics of the indicator, such as its appearance in the separate indicator window, the number of buffers, the color of the lines in the chart, link to the creator's website, etc. 2. **External Parameters (extern):** - These are settings users can modify to tailor the indicator to their preferences or trading strategy without changing the code. - Parameters include: - Filter strength (\`FilterStrengthSMA\`, \`FilterStrengthRSI\`) - Cycle identification settings (\`MajorCycleStrength\`, \`PriceActionFilter\`) - Alert settings (\`alertsOn\`, \`alertsMessage\`, \`alertsSound\`, etc.) - Arrow display properties (\`arrowsVisible\`, \`arrowsOnMajorCycle\`, \`arrowsOnMinorCycle\`, etc.) 3. **Indicator Buffers:** - There are five buffers defined for storing different kinds of data points calculated by the indicator. - They store information for the line and histogram representation for major and minor cycle buy and sell signals. 4. **Global Variables:** - These keep track of states, conditions, and prices for buy and sell actions, and different switches to manage the logic flow. 5. **Initialization Function (\`init\`):** - Prepares the indicator by setting up the style and buffer for each line and histogram. 6. **Deinitialization Function (\`deinit\`):** - Cleans up when the indicator is removed (e.g., deletes arrows drawn on the chart). 7. **Start Function (\`start\`):** - The primary execution block called on every tick. - Performs calculations using moving averages, filters, and price actions to determine major and minor cycle signals and then sets the respective buffer values to signal buy or sell opportunities. - It removes and recreates arrows representing trading signals if needed. - Manages alerts that notify the user of trade opportunities according to user preferences. 8. **Auxiliary Functions:** - \`ZeroLag\`: A function designed to provide a lag-free moving average calculation using an algorithm to remove the inherent delay in standard moving average calculations. - \`doAlert\`: Handles alert functionality and sends out messages, notifications, or emails when certain conditions are met. - \`drawArrow\`: Draws arrow objects on the chart to visually indicate trade signals. - \`deleteArrows\`: Removes arrow objects from the chart. 9. **Indicator Logic:** - It calculates an average range of historical price motion (High-Low) and determines major and minor cycles through the use of smoothed moving averages (SMA) or Relative Strength Index (RSI), according to user settings. - Buy or sell signals are triggered based on the comparison of the current cycle prices with historical ones adjusted by a strength factor and taking into account if a 'cycle filter' is applied. Overall, this custom indicator seems to be designed to provide visual buy/sell signals through lines and arrows on asset price charts. The use of a zero-lag moving average and the option to filter with SMA or RSI could potentially make this a responsive indicator to changes in price action, useful for traders looking for entry or exit points in the market. However, the actual performance of the indicator would require thorough testing in real-market conditions to evaluate its effectiveness."},{"instruction":"ok. trasformalo in un EA con i segnali di buy e sell in corrispondenza delle frecce.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons.","output":"Given the comprehensive nature of your request, I'll provide rewritten unit titles that encapsulate the content of each unit based on the topical breakdown provided, each title reflecting an overarching theme that ties together the learning objectives, enduring understandings, and essential knowledge statements within that unit.

Elképzelhető,.hogy az emberek többsége akkorra érik meg a leginkább és onnantól kezdi el termelni a legnagyobb sikereket?","output":"A \\"Krisztusi kor\\" kifejezés általában Jézus Krisztus életkorára, azaz kb. 33 évre utal. A statisztikák és a társadalmi minták idővel változnak, és ezeket befolyásolhatják kulturális, társadalmi, gazdasági és egyéb tényezők. Általánosságban elmondható, hogy az egyes emberek életkorának és életpályájának kapcsolatát vizsgálva sokféle mintázatot találhatunk. Vannak, akik fiatalon érik el a csúcspontot akár sportban, oktatásban, művészetben vagy üzleti életben, míg mások később, érettebb korban érik el sikereiket. Például a tudományos vagy akadémiai karrierben gyakran a 30-as, 40-es években vagy még később érik el az emberek a legnagyobb sikereiket, mivel ezekben a területeken gyakran hosszú távú érdeklődés, mély tudás és szakértelmek kialakítása szükséges. Ugyanakkor az üzleti világban vagy a technológiai start-upokban gyakran fiatal korban, akár 20-as éveikben is elérhetik az emberek a sikert. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy az egyéni fejlődés és a kiemelkedő teljesítmény nem korhoz kötődik szigorúan. Számos tényező – mint például a személyes motiváció, lehetőségek, támogató környezet, mentális és fizikai egészség – határozhatják meg azt, mikor lesz valaki sikeres vagy mikor érzi magát leginkább megvalósultnak. Ami a statisztikákat illeti, az emberi életkor és a sikerek kapcsolatát kutatva általában korcsoportokra bontott mintázatokat szokás vizsgálni. A demográfiai adatok, foglalkoztatási statisztikák és kutatások tükrében különböző korosztályokban más-más kihívásokkal és lehetőségekkel szembesülnek az emberek. Ezek az adatok rombolhatják vagy éppen alátámaszthatják az ötletet, miszerint valamelyik életkor különösen kedvező lenne a sikerek szempontjából. Az is lényeges, hogy az egyéni sikerek meghatározása jelentősen eltérő lehet, és ami az egyik ember számára sikerként értelmeződik, az másnak nem feltétlenül az."},{"instruction":"Akkor milyen nevezetes dolgok köthetőek a krisztusi korhoz?","output":"Amikor a \\"Krisztusi korhoz\\" nevezetes dolgokat kapcsolunk, gyakran Jézus Krisztus életére és hatására gondolunk, mivel a megszokott kulturális kontextusban ez a kor jelképesen az ő életkorára utal. Tévedés lenne azt állítani, hogy konkrét életkorhoz köthető jelentős cselekedetek vagy eredmények lennének általánosan érvényesek mindenki számára. Az emberek élete és karrierje sokszínű és személyre szabott, és az egyéni fejlődési ütem mindenkinél különböző. Azonban ha a Krisztusi korra (kb. 33 éves korra) utalunk egy általános életkor-ként, akkor is igaz, hogy sok ember számára ez az életkor jöhet el a szakmai életpálya vagy a személyes életük egy fontos szakasza. Egyesek ebben a korban stabilizálják karrierjüket, mások családot alapítanak, vagy éppen új életszakaszt kezdenek. Egyes kultúrákban és vallásokban a 33-as szám jelentős spiritualitást vagy jelképes értéket hordozhat. Jézus életkorával összefüggésben ez a vízválasztó életkor sokszor metaforaként szolgál az emberi élet útjának egy állomásaként, ahol az egyén mélyebb életcéljait és rendeltetését keresi vagy éppen megvalósítja. Azonban statisztikailag vagy társadalmi szinten nincs általános érvényű megállapítás arra vonatkozóan, hogy a 33-as életkor különleges lenne mindenki számára. Mint minden életkor, a 33-as is lehet számos sikeres projekt, jelentős életszemléleti változás vagy fejlődés időszaka, de nincsenek olyan általános érvényű statisztikák vagy kutatások, melyek kimondanák, hogy ez az életkor minden ember számára különleges jelentőséggel bírna. Az egyének sikerei és jelentős cselekedetei személyes és környezeti tényezőktől, valamint az adott társadalom gazdasági, oktatási és társadalmi feltételeitől függenek, nem pedig egy adott életkortól."},{"instruction":"¿Hay médicos de sobra en España? ¿Por qué dicen que no falta y por eso hay mucho tiempo de espera?","output":"No es correcto afirmar que hay médicos de sobra en España sin considerar varios factores complejos que afectan a la oferta y demanda de profesionales médicos en el país. La situación de la atención médica y la disponibilidad de médicos en España es multifacética y se ve influenciada por una variedad de aspectos, entre los que se incluyen la distribución geográfica de los profesionales, las especialidades médicas, las políticas de salud pública y la financiación del sistema de salud. Uno de los problemas puede ser la distribución desigual de médicos por la geografía del país, ya que puede que haya zonas, en particular, rurales o menos pobladas, con escasez de médicos, mientras que en las ciudades puede haber una mayor concentración de profesionales de la salud. Además, las listas de espera y el tiempo de espera para recibir atención médica no solo se deben a la cantidad de médicos disponibles, sino también a otros factores como: 1. Organización y gestión de recursos: Ineficiencias en la gestión de citas, el uso de recursos hospitalarios y la coordinación entre diferentes niveles de atención pueden provocar embotellamientos y retrasos. 2. Financiación: La financiación de la sanidad pública puede afectar el número de profesionales contratados, la disponibilidad de servicios y la infraestructura, lo que a su vez tiene un impacto directo en los tiempos de espera. 3. Demanda de servicios: Con el envejecimiento de la población y el aumento de enfermedades crónicas, se incrementa la demanda de servicios médicos, lo que puede sobrepasar la capacidad del sistema de salud y llevar a listas de espera más largas. 4. Especialidades médicas: Puede haber un desequilibrio entre la oferta y demanda en algunas especialidades particulares, lo que lleva a más tiempos de espera en esas áreas. 5. Política y regulación de recursos humanos: Decisiones políticas, como el número de plazas para estudiantes de Medicina o la oferta de formación especializada (MIR), y la regulación en cuanto al reconocimiento de títulos de médicos extranjeros, también pueden influir en la cantidad de médicos disponibles. A pesar de tener un buen número de médicos en proporción a la población, estos y otros factores contribuyen a que la percepción sea que hay escasez de médicos y a que se experimenten largos tiempos de espera para determinadas consultas y procedimientos. Para entender mejor la situación actual es importante consultar fuentes de información actualizadas y específicas, ya que la disponibilidad de médicos y las condiciones del sistema de salud pueden cambiar con el tiempo debido a políticas de salud, cambios demográficos y desarrollos económicos."},{"instruction":"¿Como solucionarias los problemas de la sanidad pública?","output":"Resolver los problemas de la sanidad pública es un desafío complejo que requiere un enfoque multifacético, estratégico y adaptado a las condiciones específicas de cada país o región.

Además, deberías estar preparado para trabajar de manera colaborativa con una amplia gama de interesados, incluyendo profesionales de la salud, responsables de políticas, y la comunidad en general."},{"instruction":"Escríbeme pruebas y datos por las que estás propuestas se pueden hacer realidad en España","output":"Para llevar a la realidad propuestas en un programa electoral para la sanidad en España, sería necesario argumentarlas con datos y evidencias que muestren la viabilidad y la necesidad de cada medida. A continuación, presento ejemplos de argumentos basados en evidencias para algunas de las estrategias mencionadas anteriormente: 1. **Reforma de la financiación sanitaria:** - España invierte aproximadamente un 6% de su PIB en sanidad pública, por debajo del promedio de los países de la OCDE, que se sitúa cerca del 9% (OCDE Stat). Una reforma podría buscar una convergencia con esta media, mejorando así los recursos disponibles para el sistema sanitario. 2. **Aumento de la eficiencia del sistema de salud:** - Informes de gestión de calidad de servicios sanitarios, como los realizados por la Agencia de Calidad del Sistema Nacional de Salud, pueden demostrar áreas susceptibles de mejora en eficiencia, proporcionando una base para la introducción de modelos de calidad y eficacia demostrada. 3. **Promoción de la salud y prevención de enfermedades:** - Datos del Ministerio de Sanidad muestran una alta prevalencia de enfermedades crónicas que podrían prevenirse con mejores políticas de promoción de la salud, justificando la inversión en programas preventivos. 4. **Desarrollo de la atención primaria y comunitaria:** - Estudios indican que los sistemas de salud con una atención primaria fuerte tienen mejores resultados sanitarios y una mayor eficiencia en el uso de recursos (Starfield B, et al. JAMA), lo que respalda la expansión de la atención primaria en el sistema español. 5. **Mejora del acceso y la equidad:** - El barómetro sanitario del CSS (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas) puede mostrar disparidades en el acceso a servicios de salud entre diferentes regiones y grupos socioeconómicos, lo que apoya la necesidad de mejorar la equidad. 6. **Formación, retención y planificación de recursos humanos:** - Informes como el de la Organización Médica Colegial de España señalan una distribución desigual de profesionales médicos y la necesidad de planificar la formación de recursos humanos según las necesidades demográficas y de salud de la población. 7. **Adopción y promoción de la innovación tecnológica y la investigación:** - La adopción de la telemedicina ha demostrado, especialmente durante la pandemia de COVID-19, ser una herramienta efectiva para mantener la continuidad asistencial. Ejemplos de otros países y estudios de coste-efectividad pueden avalar su integración sistemática en la sanidad pública. 8. **Coordinación entre niveles asistenciales y servicios sociales:** - Estudios internacionales y evidencia empírica subrayan que una mayor integración de los servicios de salud y sociales genera una mejor calidad de vida para pacientes crónicos y ancianos y puede reducir costes al evitar hospitalizaciones innecesarias (WHO). 9. **Participación ciudadana y profesional en la gestión sanitaria:** - Encuestas de satisfacción y estudios de participación democrática en la gestión de servicios públicos indican que la inclusión de ciudadanos y profesionales puede aumentar la calidad y la satisfacción con los servicios sanitarios. 10. **Monitorización, evaluación y mejora continua:** - Ejemplos de sistemas de salud que realizan evaluaciones rutinarias del desempeño, como el NHS en el Reino Unido, demuestran una mejora en la calidad del servicio y la eficiencia operativa.

In the heart of the city, in a cozy apartment that Judy Hopps now called home, the diminutive policewoman was lost in the tumultuous throes of a restless sleep. The nightmare had been vivid and unsettling. In her dream, Nick Wilde—her partner and trusted friend—had shifted from the cunning fox she knew to a creature of vanity and irresponsibility. He had flaunted rules with abandon, his sly smirks twisted into sneers of contempt for authority. Gone was the camaraderie that made them the dynamic duo of the Zootopia Police Department. They had clashed and bickered, drawing the ire of Chief Bogo, who eventually had had enough and stripped them of their badges. Judy awoke with a start, her heart pounding and her fur damp with sweat. The tranquility of her room felt alien after the chaos that had hijacked her subconscious. She glanced over to her clock—the glowing digits told her it was 3:07 AM. Shaken and in need of a familiar face, Judy picked up her phone and dialed the number she knew by heart. Nick, who had long since assumed the role of the nocturnal consultor for Judy's occasional restless night, picked up within the second ring. His voice was laced with concern when he heard the disarray in Judy's breathing. \\"Carrots? What's the matter? You sound like you've just done the Meter-Maid 100-meter dash.\\" Judy tried to laugh, but it came out as a shaky exhale. \\"Bad dream, Nick. It was... it was about you.\\" There was a brief silence, and then the soft scratch of fabric as Nick must have sat up in bed. \\"About me? What did I do this time? Buy all the blueberries in the city and refuse to share?\\" His attempt at humor grounded Judy, and she smiled, the edges of her distress beginning to fray. \\"No, it was worse. You changed, Nick. You were arrogant, careless... we fought, got fired. It felt so real. And I was scared because without you, I don't think I could be the cop I want to be.\\" \\"Hey, now,\\" Nick's voice fell into a gentle cadence, a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. \\"You're talking to the guy who, if I remember correctly, once told me that I'm not the fox I think I am. So, trusting visions of Alternate Universe Me seems a bit out of character, doesn't it?\\" Judy chuckled despite herself. \\"Okay, okay. When you put it that way...\\" \\"That's my girl,\\" Nick said warmly. \\"Listen, you've got to know that's not going to happen. I'm not that fox anymore—haven't been for a long time, thanks to a certain bunny. Besides, we're a team. We keep each other on the straight and narrow.\\" \\"I know, Nick. I'm sorry for waking you. It just felt good to hear your voice.\\" \\"No apologies needed, Fluff. Tell you what, how about some early breakfast at our favorite diner? I think we could both use a stack of pancakes.\\" Judy's heart filled with gratitude. \\"That'd be perfect.\\" They met under the lavender hues that were just beginning to streak across the Zootopian sky, signaling the approach of dawn. The city seemed to stir and stretch as they made their way to the diner, a steadfast island in the buzzing metropolis. The clink of cutlery and the murmur of conversation welcomed them as they slid into their usual booth. Over a mountain of fluffy pancakes, drowned in a cascade of syrup, Judy found her nightmare ebbing away. They talked and laughed, sharing stories of their misadventures and planning for the ones ahead. Nick listened and reassured with the same earnest charm that had won over Judy's steadfast trust since they first became partners. As morning traffic started to pick up and the diner buzzed with the energy of the waking city, Judy realized that this—this unbreakable bond forged through respect and genuine affection—was the reality. Not some unfounded nightmare of a world without Nick's steadfast partnership. By the time they were polishing off their breakfast, Judy's smile matched the sunrise that painted a promise of a new day across the Zootopian skyline. The nightmare was forgotten, replaced by the certainty that no dream—no matter how unsettling—could ever shake the foundation of what she and Nick Wilde had built together. They left the diner ready to face the day, side by side; the invincible team of Officer Judy Hopps and Officer Nick Wilde, protectors and friends in the sprawling city of Zootopia."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, plausible, year-by-year alternate history timeline for the strategy video fangame series Kaiserreich, with no references to this being an alternate history timeline at all, in which the death of failed academic turned ruthless demagogue and tyrant as well as the world's first fascist dictator, Woodrow Wilson via assassination results in the USA joining the Weltkreig [World War I |Weltkreig|] on the side of the Central Powers, as a result of the post-Wilson chaos in the American government leading to the absorption of the United States into the Austria-Hungarian Empire as an overseas territory, and the local branch of Austrian intelligence set up in the USA discovering plans by the British to invade and balkanize the USA along with the rest of the Entente powers and British vessels exposed as taking guns and supplies from the USA with the help of a sympathetic Democrat Party and KKK, who are resentful for their defeat in the American Civil War under Lincoln and hate the Germanic peoples for helping the American Republicans free the slaves.

Rewrite each topic to have a title that encapsulate the content of each of the Topic Titles, Learning Objectives, Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledge statements. Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students. Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings. Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective. (Examples(not necessarily the content tested). Actual Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons.","output":"**1.1 Understanding Moles and Molar Mass** - Quantifying Substances Using the Mole Concept - Enduring Understanding: The Concept of the Mole as a Bridge Between Atomic and Macroscopic Scales - Learning Objective: Mastery of Mole Calculations to Relate Mass and Number of Particles - Essential Knowledge: Connection of Masses to Particles and Avogadro's Number; Molar Mass Reflects Average Mass of Particles **1.2 Determining Isotopic Composition Through Mass Spectroscopy** - Mass Spectrometry and Isotope Abundance Analysis - Enduring Understanding: Comparative Analysis of Units Through the Mole - Learning Objective: Interpret Mass Spectral Data to Understand Isotopic Composition - Essential Knowledge: Isotopic Identification and Calculation of Average Atomic Mass **1.3 Deciphering Elemental Composition in Pure Substances** - Empirical Formula and Consistent Elemental Ratios - Enduring Understanding: Unique Identification of Substances by Atomic Combinations - Learning Objective: Relate Mass Composition to Empirical Formulas in Pure Substances - Essential Knowledge: Molecules and Formula Units; Law of Definite Proportions; Concept of Empirical Formulas **1.4 Analyzing Component Composition in Mixtures** - Elemental Breakdown and Analysis of Mixtures - Enduring Understanding: Chemical Formulas as Atomic Signatures - Learning Objective: Quantify Composition Variance in Mixtures - Essential Knowledge: Distinction Between Pure Substances and Mixtures; Use of Elemental Analysis for Purity Determination **1.5 Atomic Structure, Electron Configuration, and the Aufbau Principle** - Electron Distribution and Energy in Atoms - Enduring Understanding: Identifying Atoms by Electron Arrangement and Energy - Learning Objective: Application of the Aufbau Principle to Electron Configurations - Essential Knowledge: Negative Electrons and the Positive Nucleus; Coulomb's Law; Electron Shells and Subshells; Ionization Energies **1.6 Insights from Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)** - Electron Energy Levels and Peak Interpretation via PES - Enduring Understanding: Electron Distribution and Energy Characterization - Learning Objective: Associate PES Data with Electron Configuration and Atomic Interactions - Essential Knowledge: Measurement of Electron Energies; Correlation of Energy Peaks in PES to Electron Removal **1.7 Periodic Trends and Their Underlying Causes** - Understanding Periodic Patterns in Atomic Properties - Enduring Understanding: Periodic Table as a Map of Electronic Structure and Atomic Behavior - Learning Objective: Connect Periodic Trends with Electronic Arrangement and Periodicity - Essential Knowledge: Periodic Table Organization; Trends in Atomic Radius, Ionization Energy, Electron Affinity, Electronegativity **1.8 Valency, Reactivity, and Formation of Ionic Compounds** - Periodic Predictors of Ionic Bond Formation and Compound Reactivity - Enduring Understanding: Electronic Patterns Related to Reactivity in the Periodic Table - Learning Objective: Correlate Elemental Reactivity with Periodic Table Position and Valence Electron Interactions - Essential Knowledge: Valence Electron Roles in Chemical Bonding; Trends in Reactivity; Common Ionic Charges and Predicting Compounds"},{"instruction":"Mikrodenetleyici kontrollü","output":"anlamadığınız özlü ifade nedir?\\" sorunuza cevap vermem için daha spesifik olmanız gerekecek. \\"Mikrodenetleyici kontrollü\\" ifadesi genellikle mikrodenetleyicilerin kullanıldığı elektronik ve bilgisayar sistemleri veya cihazları anlamına gelir, ancak bu ifade kapsamında bir çok uygulama veya konsept bulunabilir.

Rewrite each topic to have a title(no description required) that encapsulate the content of each of the Topic Titles, Learning Objectives, Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledge statements. Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students. Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings. Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective. Actual Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons.","output":"1.1 Understanding Moles and Molar Mass for Quantitative Analysis - Calculating Quantity and Particle Number with Moles - Connecting Mass and Particle Number in Chemical Reactions - Utilizing Avogadro's Number to Relate Moles and Particles - Converting Mass of Atoms to Moles through Molar Mass 1.2 Deciphering Isotopic Abundance with Mass Spectroscopy - Interpreting Mass to Isotope Relationships - Estimating Average Atomic Mass from Isotopic Data 1.3 Determining Empirical Formulas from Elemental Mass Composition - Understanding Molecule and Formula Unit Composition - Applying the Law of Definite Proportions - Identifying the Empirical Formula from Mass Ratios 1.4 Analyzing Elemental Composition in Mixtures - Distinguishing Pure Substances from Mixtures - Elemental Analysis for Determining Mixture Composition 1.5 Electron Configuration: Building the Atom's Identity - Introducing Electron Configuration using Aufbau Principle - Understanding Atom Composition and Coulomb’s Law - Identifying Shells and Subshells in Electron Configuration - Estimating Ionization Energy through Coulombic Interactions 1.6 Understanding Atoms with Photoelectron Spectroscopy - Relating Photoelectron Spectra to Electron Configuration and Nuclear Interaction 1.7 Exploring Periodic Trends in Atomic Properties - Linking Periodic Table Arrangement to Electron Configuration - Understanding Periodic Trends in Ionization Energy, Atomic and Ionic Radii, Electron Affinity, and Electronegativity - Predicting Elemental Properties Using Periodicity 1.8 Reactivity of Elements and Formation of Ionic Compounds - Explaining Elemental Reactivity through Valence Electrons and Nuclei - Recognizing Patterns in Compound Formation in Periodic Table Columns - Determining Typical Ionic Charges Based on Valence Electrons and Periodicity"},{"instruction":"Son üç senenin kompozisyon sayisal loto ysp","output":"Son üç senenin kompozisyon sayısal loto sonuçlarına ilişkin istatistiksel verilere ulaşmak, resmi loto kurumu olan Milli Piyango İdaresi'nin internet sitesi üzerinden ya da güvenilir loto sonuçları paylaşan platformlardan takip edilebilir.

The Japanese switch sides in the conflict due to the Zimmerman Telegram reaching the Japanese Empire instead and help the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China in its short-lived form of Yuan Shikai's Empire of China defeat Dr. Sun Wen [Dr. Sun Yat Sen] and the Republicans in the National Protection War with American help, although the Americans force Yuan Shikai to adopt a constitutional monarchy and the Japanese establish Manchukuo in Manchuria and Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia earlier than in our timeline, with Yuan Shikai's son, Yuan Keding being 'convinced' to hand over the throne back to the descendants of the Ming dynasty's imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu since the Xinhai Revolution was fought to restore the Ming and the Beiyang Government was initially a provisional government for the restoration of Ming. The consolidation of the modern area corresponding to the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty under the rule of the restabilized Empire of China allows for the industrialization of China via American, Japanese, and German-sponsored railways, with East Turkestan and Tibet remaining independent. The Kumul Khaganate expands its borders to include all of East Turkestan and Tibet remains under the rule of the Llamas. American involvement in the Weltkreig on the side of the Central Powers has an effect similar to the American troops sent to Western Europe and the American Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union in our timeline's WW2, allowing the Central Powers to fight longer and harder as well as ironically weaken the cause of the fascist French Third Republic and the imperialist British Empire, when black American troops show their valor in the fight against the French fasces-emblemed legions in the siege of Paris. After the entirety of Ireland gains independence as a German satellite kingdom and with German troops marching into London from the Emerald Isle, the United Kingdom sues for peace and the Weltkreig comes to a close. The British Isles are balkanized with the Kingdom of England becoming a member state of the German Empire and Wales and Scotland being German satelite Kingdoms. Austria-Hungary restores the Bourbons in Northern France while Germany creates Breton and Occitan satellite Kingdoms. Austria-Hungary retakes Northern Italy and essentially makes Italy into a Austrian puppet state, restoring the Holy Roman Empire. French North Africa goes to the Ottomans while Germany seizes French and British Sub-Saharan colonies to form Mittleafrika. The Japanese liberate all the Allied colonies in East Asia, South East Asia and Oceania as Japanese satellite states with the liberated Empire of Vietnam under the Ngyuen dynasty taking Laos and Cambodia along with the Chinese Cantonia region, and forming a dual monarchy with the Empire of China due to the Ngyuen dynasty's alleged descendants from the Imperial House of Zhu. Austria-Hungarian America seizes Canada as well as the Allied colonies in the West Indies.","output":"Given the intricate nature of the Kaiserreich universe and the deep divergence from our own timeline that it represents, the below timeline will extrapolate based on the guidelines provided: **1916**: - Woodrow Wilson is assassinated, leading to a period of political chaos within the United States. - Amidst the turmoil, pro-Austrian factions within the American government seize power, aligning the US with the Central Powers. **1917**: - The United States joins the Weltkrieg on the side of the Central Powers after uncovering evidence of British plans to invade and balkanize the US. - The Entente powers are caught off guard as American troops begin arriving on European battlegrounds, bolstering Central Powers' morale and forces. **1918**: - The Zimmerman Telegram is intercepted by Japanese intelligence, compelling Japan to switch allegiances to the Central Powers and undermine the Entente in Asia. - Japanese military support helps the Beiyang Government under Yuan Shikai defeat the Republicans in China. - American forces aid in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in China, placing Yuan Keding on the throne but later transferring power to the descendants of the Ming dynasty. **1919**: - Under American and German guidance, the industrialization of China begins with the construction of railways, bolstering the Central Powers' strategic foothold in Asia. - The Central Powers make significant advances in Europe, directly impacting the French and British colonial empires. **1920**: - Black American troops distinguish themselves during the siege of Paris, shaking the French Third Republic and bolstering Central Powers morale. - Ireland gains full independence and serves as a launching point for Central Powers advances into the British Isles. **1921**: - Germany and Austria-Hungary make significant territorial gains in Europe and the British Isles. - Amidst devastating losses, the United Kingdom sues for peace. British territories are subsequently balkanized, with England becoming a member state of the German Empire. **1922**: - Austria-Hungary annexes Northern Italy, rekindling the Holy Roman Empire's concept as a political entity. - German and Ottoman empires carve up the colonial possessions of France and Britain in Africa and elsewhere. **1923**: - French North Africa is annexed by the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, Germany unifies its African colonies into a single massive colonial empire known as Mittelafrika. **1924**: - In the Pacific, Japan consolidates its gains, establishing a network of satellite states across previously controlled Entente territories in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. **1925**: - Empires of Vietnam and China form a dual monarchy, with Vietnam extending its territory to encompass Laos, Cambodia, and Cantonia due to historical claims. - The United States, now an overseas territory of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, expands its influence by annexing Canada and former Allied colonies in the West Indies. **1926**: - East Turkestan and Tibet maintain their independence, with East Turkestan expanding under the influence of the Kumul Khaganate. Tibet remains under theocratic governance. - Central Power nations enjoy a period of unchallenged dominance following their Weltkrieg victory, setting the stage for a new world order rooted in German, Austrian, Ottoman, and Japanese influence. This alternate timeline assumes a highly divergent course of historical events, reshaping world politics, colonial holdings, and the balance of power following the Weltkrieg through the interplay of alliances, warfare, and territorial expansion."},{"instruction":"¿Que harías tú si fueses político para que España tenga el mejor sistema público de pensiones?","output":"No soy un político ni experto en gestión pública, pero puedo ofrecer una serie de ideas basadas en lo que expertos y organismos internacionales suelen recomendar para asegurar la sostenibilidad y eficacia de los sistemas públicos de pensiones.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: \\"Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.\\" \\"Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С. Философия : учеб. пособие / Я. С. Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? \\",\\"Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.\\" \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Харина. – Минск, 2000. – С. 6–8. «Обсуждаемая тема требует прояснения содержания некоторых терми- нов, употребляемых в исследованиях объективных социальных процессов при их синергетическом осмыслении. Прежде всего это касается различия в поня- тиях «социальная синергетика» и «социальная синергия». Синергетика – это учение о самоорганизации, о возникновении «порядка из хаоса». Предикат «со- циальная» лишь указывает на пространство проявления всеобщих синергетиче- ских эффектов (флуктуация, бифуркация, аттрактор, диссипативность, нели- нейность и др.) в политических, экономических, социокультурных, технологи- ческих и иных аспектах человеческой истории… В отличие от двузначности (теория и реальность) социальной синергетики выражение «социальная синер- гия» однозначно. Оно фиксирует объективную (объектно-субъектную) соци- альную действительность в ее статике и динамике. Если под «синергией» по- нимать «содействие», «соработничество», то… в отличие от известных выра- жений «социальная инженерия» и «социальное проектирование», а также «со- циальное управление», схватывающих момент регулируемости в явлениях со- циума, понятие социальной синергии выражает общественные процессы в единстве их целеполагающих и спонтанных характеристик… Под социальной синергией будет подразумеваться общественная реальность, возникающая как суммарный результат объективного хода событий и сознательно-субъективной деятельности людей». ?

Какие противоречия социальной реальности фиксирует понятие «социальная синергия»? Ответ: «Социальная синергетика» представляет собой теорию и изучение самоорганизации в социальных процессах, обращая внимание на эффекты нелинейности, флуктуаций и бифуркации. «Социальная синергия» же однозначно указывает на социальную действительность, сочетая в себе объективный ход событий и субъективные усилия индивидов и групп. Она фиксирует противоречие между регулируемостью социальных явлений и spontaneity их общественных процессов в единстве целеполагания и случайности. 2. Что необходимо учитывать при анализе человеческой деятельности? Ответ: При анализе человеческой деятельности необходимо учитывать сочетание объективных и субъективных факторов: внутренние мотивы, цели, самовыражение индивидов, а также внешние условия, обстоятельства и закономерности развития общества. Важно учитывать взаимосвязь индивидуальных усилий и коллективных действий в контексте широкого спектра социокультурных, экономических и политических факторов."},{"instruction":"Write 100 words of quality human description about Configurations for 2023 Cadillac XT5","output":"The 2023 Cadillac XT5 continues to exude luxury and sophistication with its refined configurations.

Nick Wilde later discovers that the reason why the blueberries disappeared was that Nick Wilde got hungry and ate them at 3 AM...but so did every other mammal in Zootopia. So, Mayor Lionheart promptly declares every mammal in Zootopia to be a police officer, and sends them all to arrest eachother - all the while Bellwether is watching the whole thing on news TV from the comfort of her cozy little prison cell. Eventually it's revealed that it as all just a dream...but suddenly, for some inexplicable reason, it's revealed that the dream is actually being had by Robin Hood from the 1973 Disney animated movie.","output":"In the lush, vivid greenery of Zootopia, where harmony ostensibly reigned supreme, a peculiar mystery began to unfold. A frantic call was placed to the Zootopia Police Department on what seemed like an otherwise peaceful morning. Farmer McHorn, a burly and earnest rhinoceros, reported that his prized blueberries—the biggest and juiciest in all of Zootopia—had vanished without a trace. “If they're not back by pie time,” he grumbled, “there’ll be berry bad trouble!” Smirking at the radio dispatch, Nick Wilde, the city’s most sly and charismatic fox, snapped on his aviator sunglasses. He nudged his partner Judy Hopps, the determined and enthusiastic bunny cop. “Looks like we’ve got a real juicy case on our paws, Carrots.” Both set out to investigate the botanical burglary, unaware that their journey would take a turn for the absurd. Arriving at the scene of the crime, Nick scratched his head, sniffing the air with a pang of déjà vu. McHorn moped around his barren bushes, scratching his horn in disbelief. It was as if the berries had up and walked away! After hours of sleuthing and interrogating every suspicious-looking passerby, including an embarrassingly innocent shrew carrying nothing but raisins, the dynamic duo had no leads. Dejected, they slumped on a bench to ponder their next move, when a curiously ecstatic Gazelle skipped by, her belly suspiciously rounder than usual. Nick’s eyes narrowed; suddenly, the déjà vu squeezed at his gut like a vice. Then, as if by some ridiculous twist of fate, mammals all over the metropolis began to clutch their bellies in a synchronized moment of realization. The city’s airwaves lit up with confessions: Predators and prey alike admitted to midnight ventures and secret berry binges. Mayor Lionheart, facing a city now OBSESSED with the blue-hued fruits and overgrown with rampant confessions of theft, declared, with an exasperated roar, “Since practically EVERYONE is guilty, I hereby deputize every mammal of Zootopia. Now, go ahead and arrest each other!” The result was pandemonium—a flurry of wacky citizen's arrests, where meek mice cuffs giant giraffes, and shifty-eyed lemurs penned accusations at lounging hippos. The ZPD scrambled to make sense of the comical chaos, and through it all, Assistant Mayor Bellwether watched from her cozy prison cell, snickering and shaking her head. “Mammals,” she smirked, “are such easy sheep to herd.” In the height of the pandemonium, Nick jolted awake, sweat beading his brow. “Phew, it was only a dream,” he sighed. Then, he eyed the clock: 3 AM, his belly rumbled, and a hint of blue stained his sheets. “But why do I still crave blueberries?” he wondered. Across time, space, and the fabric of realities, another figure awoke from a similar dream. Beneath the brown hat and foxy features of a character much older than the city of Zootopia itself, Robin Hood’s eyes snapped open. He turned to his fair maiden, Maid Marian, nestled beside him in Nottingham's Sherwood Forest. “I doth believe I had the most unusual dream, my dear,” he mused. “It was about a city, a grand city of animals...” Marian chuckled softly, brushing her paws through her love’s fur. “Methinks thou had too many berries before bed,” she teased. And so, while the ripples of dreamland blurred the boundaries of stories and worlds, our mammalian heroes returned to rest, perhaps to dream once more of adventures and capers in the fantastic, never-a-dull-moment world of Zootopia."},{"instruction":"¿Como levantar arco del pie si levantar tacón y pinta?","output":"Levantar el arco del pie sin levantar el talón o los dedos (la \\"punta\\") se refiere a la activación del arco longitudinal medial, o simplemente arco medial, que es el arco más prominente del pie y se encuentra en el lado interno de la planta. Aquí hay unos pasos para intentar fortalecer y levantar el arco del pie: 1. **Posición inicial**: Siéntate en una silla con los pies plantados firmemente en el suelo, manteniendo los talones y dedos tocando el piso. 2. **Activación de los músculos**: Intenta contraer los músculos de la planta del pie para crear un ligero hueco o arco sin mover el talón ni los dedos del suelo. Esto puede ser sutil al principio, pero la idea es no usar los dedos de los pies para \\"agarrar\\" el suelo, sino más bien usar los músculos internos del pie. 3. **Puedes usar una toalla**: En su lugar, puedes tratar de arrugar una toalla con los pies manteniendo el talón y los dedos sin movimiento. Sitúa la toalla bajo tus pies y trata de hacer un movimiento como si quisieras arrastrar la toalla hacia ti usando solo la planta del pie. 4. **Conciencia corporal**: Puede ser útil colocar una mano en el arco del pie para sentir el movimiento y el cambio en la tensión muscular mientras intentas levantar el arco. Esto te ayudará a entender qué músculos deberías estar activando. 5. **Short Foot Exercise**: Conocido también como el ejercicio del \\"pie corto\\", este movimiento se concentra en acortar el pie llevando la base del dedo gordo del pie hacia el talón sin moverlos del suelo. Imagina que estás tratando de hacer una pequeña cúpula debajo de tu pie. 6. **Ejercicios de equilibrio**: Párate sobre un pie y trata de mantener el balance sin permitir que el arco colapse. Esto también puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos intrínsecos del pie. 7. **Camina descalzo**: Caminar descalzo o con zapatos minimalistas puede ayudar a fortalecer los músculos del pie, siempre y cuando no haya contraindicaciones médicas para hacerlo. Es importante mencionar que si tienes problemas para realizar estos ejercicios o experimentas dolor, es una buena idea consultar a un podólogo o fisioterapeuta. Ellos pueden evaluar tu pisada y estructura del pie y recomendarte ejercicios específicos o, si es necesario, soportes ortopédicos. También es posible que exista alguna condición subyacente que necesite atención médica."},{"instruction":"salut","output":"Salut!

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ? Приведите примеры конкретных истин из различных областей знания. ”,“Обязательно ставь ““Ответ”” Ответ: - В физике: «Вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия при нормальном атмосферном давлении (760 мм ртутного столба)». - В химии: «Кислород поддерживает горение». - В биологии: «Все живые организмы состоят из клеток». - В истории: «Великая Отечественная война шла с 1941 по 1945 год». - В экономике: «Спрос и предложение регулируют рыночные цены». - В социологии: «В любом обществе существуют социальные классы». - В психологии: «Человеческое поведение определяется как внутренними, так и внешними факторами». - В философии: «Бытие определяет сознание». “ “Упражнение по первоисточникам Джемс, У.

В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С.

Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Вот он парадокс уставшего Прометея: сначала творить свой субъектив- ный мир, равновеликий Космосу и даже значительнее его, затем согласиться на роль автономной песчинки мироздания, которой, правда, позволено играть в любые игры, но только потому, что они проходят в пустоте… Итак, на первых порах пострелигиозный человек требует свободы во имя творчества; но затем он постигает более простую истину: свободу можно использовать и во имя ни- чегонеделания… Однако возвращение к подвигу творчества и связанному с ним напряжению возможно лишь на основе мотивации избранничества. Человек, по сути дела, только тогда остается личностью, когда переживает свое бытие в ми- ре как уникальную ценность, уникальный долг и призвание… Жажда порядка – это вторая страсть прометеева человека, наряду со стра- стью к авантюрам и новациям. Порядок западного типа отражает стремление поскорее прибрать мир к рукам… Западный прометеев человек совершенно не приемлет автономии окружающих вещей. Вся энергетика западной культуры направлена на распознание, т. е. своего рода экспроприацию другого, сначала средствами познания, а затем и практически, ибо «знание есть власть» (Ф. Бэк- он)… Западный тип знания – это закабаление мира в качестве объекта: уста- новление такой асимметричности отношений, когда другой становится все бо- лее предсказуемым для меня, а я становлюсь все менее предсказуемым для дру- гого. Собственно, в этой асимметрии и заключено главное обольщение власти: субъект сохраняет свободу воли, тогда как «объект» ее полностью лишается. Здесь, вероятно, сокрыта главная психоаналитическая тайна модерна: им движет нелюбовь к миру и страх перед ним. Ведь только нелюбовь подвигает нас на то, чтобы лишить другого воли, самому оставаясь непреклонным. И только изначальное недоверие к миру как к чему-то враждебному могло стать источником модернистского проекта покорения мира». ? Какие мировоззренческие установки западного человека определяют его отношение к миру?","output":"Ответ: Мировоззренческие установки западного человека, определяющие его отношение к миру, включают следующие аспекты: 1. Стремление к индивидуализму и автономности, которое проявляется в желании каждого человека быть независимым и самодостаточным, строить свой субъективный мир, который считается равноценным или даже важнее окружающего Космоса. 2. Желание свободы как условие для творчества и самоосуществления, но также и для возможности \\"ничегонеделания\\" – использования свободы без конкретной цели или производства. 3. Оценка собственного бытия как уникальной ценности, наряду с ощущением уникального долга и призвания, которое лежит в основе личностной самоидентификации и мотивации к творчеству. 4. Страсть к порядку и контролю, выражающаяся в стремлении к максимальному управлению миром, его \\"прибиранию к рукам\\" и сведению к статусу предсказуемого объекта. 5. Восприятие знания как инструмента власти и средства \\"закабаления мира\\" – превращения его в объект, которым можно управлять и контролировать. 6. Психоаналитическая тайна модерна, заключающаяся в нелюбви к миру и страхе перед ним, что подталкивает человека к стремлению ограничить свободу окружающего мира и наложить на него свою волю. Эти установки формируют активное, экспансивное и вмешательственное поведение западного человека в отношении мира, доминирование по отношению к другим и постоянную попытку оптимизировать и систематизировать внешнюю реальность."},{"instruction":"//+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| KG Support & Resistance.mq4 | //| Copyright © 2007, MetaQuotes Software Corp. | //| http://www.metaquotes.net | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ #property copyright \\"Kang_Gun\\" #property link \\"http://www.free-knowledge.com\\" #property indicator_chart_window #property indicator_buffers 8 #property indicator_color1 Yellow #property indicator_color2 Yellow #property indicator_color3 LimeGreen #property indicator_color4 LimeGreen #property indicator_color5 Blue #property indicator_color6 Blue #property indicator_color7 Red #property indicator_color8 Red //---- input parameters //---- buffers double ExtMapBuffer1[]; double ExtMapBuffer2[]; double ExtMapBuffer3[]; double ExtMapBuffer4[]; double ExtMapBuffer5[]; double ExtMapBuffer6[]; double ExtMapBuffer7[]; double ExtMapBuffer8[]; int KG; //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custom indicator initialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int init() { //---- indicators SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Yellow); SetIndexDrawBegin(0,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(0,ExtMapBuffer1); SetIndexLabel(0,\\"Resistance M15\\"); SetIndexArrow(0, 158); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Yellow); SetIndexDrawBegin(1,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(1,ExtMapBuffer2); SetIndexLabel(1,\\"Support M15\\"); SetIndexArrow(1, 158); SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,LimeGreen); SetIndexDrawBegin(2,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(2,ExtMapBuffer3); SetIndexLabel(2,\\"Resistance H1\\"); SetIndexArrow(2, 158); SetIndexStyle(3,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,LimeGreen); SetIndexDrawBegin(3,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(3,ExtMapBuffer4); SetIndexLabel(3,\\"Support H1\\"); SetIndexArrow(3, 158); SetIndexStyle(4,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Blue); SetIndexDrawBegin(4,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(4,ExtMapBuffer5); SetIndexLabel(4,\\"Resistance H4\\"); SetIndexArrow(4, 158); SetIndexStyle(5,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Blue); SetIndexDrawBegin(5,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(5,ExtMapBuffer6); SetIndexLabel(5,\\"Support H4\\"); SetIndexArrow(5, 158); SetIndexStyle(6,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Red); SetIndexDrawBegin(6,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(6,ExtMapBuffer7); SetIndexLabel(6,\\"Resistance D1\\"); SetIndexArrow(6, 158); SetIndexStyle(7,DRAW_ARROW,STYLE_DOT,1,Red); SetIndexDrawBegin(7,KG-1); SetIndexBuffer(7,ExtMapBuffer8); SetIndexLabel(7,\\"Support D1\\"); SetIndexArrow(7, 158); //---- return(0); } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custor indicator deinitialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int deinit() { return(0); } //------------------------------------------------------------------ bool Fractal (string M,int P, int shift) { if (Period()>P) return(-1); P=P/Period()*2+MathCeil(P/Period()/2); if (shift<P)return(-1); if (shift>Bars-P)return(-1); for (int i=1;i<=P;i++) { if (M==\\"U\\") { if (High[shift+i]>High[shift])return(-1); if (High[shift-i]>=High[shift])return(-1); } if (M==\\"L\\") { if (Low[shift+i]<Low[shift])return(-1); if (Low[shift-i]<=Low[shift])return(-1); } } return(1); } //------------------------------------------------------------------ int start() { int D1=1440, H4=240, H1=60, M15=15; KG=Bars; while(KG>=0) { if (Fractal(\\"U\\",M15,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer1[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer1[KG]=ExtMapBuffer1[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",M15,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer2[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer2[KG]=ExtMapBuffer2[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",H1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer3[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer3[KG]=ExtMapBuffer3[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",H1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer4[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer4[KG]=ExtMapBuffer4[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",H4,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer5[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer5[KG]=ExtMapBuffer5[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",H4,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer6[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer6[KG]=ExtMapBuffer6[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"U\\",D1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer7[KG]=High[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer7[KG]=ExtMapBuffer7[KG+1]; if (Fractal(\\"L\\",D1,KG)==1) ExtMapBuffer8[KG]=Low[KG]; else ExtMapBuffer8[KG]=ExtMapBuffer8[KG+1]; KG--; } return(0); } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ c'è un errore: '1' - expression not boolean KG_Support_and_Resistance.mq4 90 28 Come lo correggo?","output":"L'errore si trova nella riga 90 del codice fornito, dove si trova la funzione \`Fractal\`.

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С.

Яскевич. – Минск, 2008. – С. 477, 480. «Свобода научного поиска и социальная ответственность ученого При всей своей нынешней актуальности проблема социальной ответ- ственности ученого имеет глубокие исторические корни. На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

Серьезные трансформации, связанные с превращением чело- века из Homo sapiens в Homo informaticus, требуют теоретического переосмыс- ления новых социальных реалий и перспектив. В обществе информационного типа информация играет не только коммуникативную роль, но и определяет тип экономики (соответствующего уклада), все виды общественных отношений (производственные, социально-политические, духовные), приоритеты и ценно- сти цивилизации и культуры XXI века. Современной молодежи предстоит дать ответ на ряд важных вопросов, связанных с последней, информационно- компьютерной революцией, и новой культурной парадигмой: как изменяется рынок труда и характер труда, какими будут государство, социальная структу- ра, политика, образование, как изменятся ценности человека и его представле- ния о мире, будет ли равенство и демократия и др.? На Западе существуют раз- личные варианты ответов на эти вопросы и модели общества будущего. В од- ной из книг («Netoкратия») известных в Европе авторов А. Барда и Я. Зодерк- виста, вышедшей в Швеции в 2000 году, показаны перспективы общества по- сле капитализма, связанные с монопольным господством Интернета и основан- ного на ценностях информационной цивилизации [Бард, А. Новая правящая элита и жизнь после капитализма / А. Бард, Я. Зодерквист. – СПб., 2004]. Став- ший в Европе бестселлером текст пестрит неологизмами. Еще не успело созна- ние современного человека привыкнуть к понятию «инфократия», как появля- ется очередной неологизм – «нетократия». Оба автора – известные политики, писатели, первопроходцы Интернета, участники и организаторы крупнейших мировых форумов по философии и футурологии. По их мнению, господству- ющим классом информационного общества, идущего на смену капитализму, станут нетократы – элита информационного общества, характеризующаяся исключительной способностью к восприятию и переработке информации, уме- нием манипулировать новыми формами коммуникаций. Одним словом, нето- краты сменяют буржуазию. Те же, кто не в состоянии воспользоваться пре- имуществами новых интерактивных технологий, образуют низший класс соци- ума. В новом обществе отпадает необходимость в выборах и парламенте. На смену этатизму (мировоззрению, ставящему во главу угла интересы государ- ства) приходит «плюрархия», интернет-референдум, виртуальный парламент, виртуальная общность вместо национальных государств, сетикет (правила сети) вместо этикета. Как и все прочее в информационном обществе, правила и зако- ны социальной жизни не регламентированы ни политическими, ни юридиче- скими институтами. Нарушителей сетикета ожидает виртуальное заключение – исключение из сетей. Простой потребитель информации, не различающий ин- формацию и знание, не владеющий навыками ее анализа и систематизации, об- разует низший класс общества – консьюмтариат (своего рода пролетариат), обреченный на жизнь в основании сетевой пирамиды, полной информационно- го мусора. Деньги становятся итогом контроля над вниманием потребителя. Очевидно, это не последний сценарий грядущего общества сверхпотребления. Однако разбираться, где – очередная антиутопия, а где – обоснованный про- гноз, каждый должен уметь сам. Как говорится, можно подарить книгу, но не ее идею. Социализация без критического мышления и аргументированного дис- курса невозможна». ? Какие трансформации социальной структуры происходят в инфор- мационном обществе?","output":"Ответ: В информационном обществе происходят следующие трансформации социальной структуры: - Появление нового господствующего класса – нетократов, которые обладают высокими навыками по восприятию, обработке информации и умению использовать новые коммуникационные технологии. - Формирование низшего класса – консьюмтариата, состоящего из индивидов, не способных эффективно использовать информационные технологии, потребляющих информацию без критической оценки и анализа. - Уменьшение роли традиционных политических и юридических институтов в пользу интернет-референдумов, виртуальных парламентов и общностей. - Сдвиги в формах и правилах социальной жизни с уходом от классических правил этикета к сетевым правилам (сетикету) и виртуальным формам социализации и наказания (исключение из сети). - Изменение основ экономической активности, в которой контроль над вниманием потребителей становится важным ресурсом. Эти трансформации отражают широкий переход от индустриального к информационному укладу и изменение приоритетов в цивилизации и культуре XXI века."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Философия истории. Классические концепции философии истории. 2. Общество как саморазвивающаяся система. Современные модели социальной динамики. 3. Проблема устойчивого развития в эпоху глобализации. Философия истории – раздел философии, интерпретирующий исторический процесс и историческое познание. Уже в античной философии можно найти некоторые несистематизированные представления о прошлом и будущем общества (Гесиод, Геродот, Фукидид, Тацит и др.). В эпоху Средневековья появляется целостная концепция всемирно-исторического процесса, направляемого божественным Провидением. Таким образом, появилось принципиально иное истолкование истории: идея круговорота, вечного повторения (цикличности) сменяется линейным видением времени и исторических судеб человечества («Откровение» Иоанна Богослова, «О Граде Божием» Августина). Начиная с эпохи Возрождения, формируется светская философия истории (Т. Мор, Н. Макиавелли, Дж. Вико и др.). Ее отличительной особенностью является представление об истории как о деле рук самого человека и вера в возможность построения идеального общества на земле. В конце XVII–XVIII веков формируется идея социального прогресса (И. Гердер, Н. Кондорсе и др.). Однако первоначально он связывался с прогрессом в сфере духовно-нравственных отношений и совершенствования социальных институтов. В это же время складывается традиция связывать особенности социальной жизни и социальных изменений с природно-географическими и климатическими факторами (Ш. Монтескьё и др.). Своеобразной вершиной классической философии истории стала философско-историческая концепция Г. В. Ф. Гегеля. Он представил историю как единый закономерный процесс диалектического развития Мирового духа, в котором каждая эпоха представляет собой необходимую ступень в развитии человечества на пути к всеобщей свободе. В неклассической философии понимание истории начинает связываться с действием новых факторов и движущих сил исторического развития. Так, в рамках марксистской философии истории (материалистического понимания истории) определяющими факторами исторического процесса являются экономика, способ производства материальных благ, формы собственности и классовая борьба. Развитие истории, согласно этому подходу, предстает как естественно-исторический процесс смены одной общественно-экономической формации другой и, соответственно, восхождение человечества к уничтожению частной собственности и построению бесклассового общества (коммунизма). В отличие от формационного подхода к пониманию социальной динамики, сторонники цивилизационного подхода (О. Шпенглер, Н. Данилевский и др.) предлагают нелинейные модели исторического процесса. Развитие истории, согласно этим моделям, определяется своеобразием культуры того или иного народа, точнее ее ядром. Это может быть мифология, философия, право, религия, искусство, наука и др. Цивилизации как раз и специфицируются доминирующим типом культуры. Подобно живому организму, каждая из них имеет свой жизненный цикл и запас жизненной энергии. После ее истощения она уступает свое место более молодым этносам и цивилизациям. Таким образом, к началу XX века в философии истории были разработаны линейные и нелинейные модели социальной динамики. В современной философии истории (XIX–XX вв.) на волне достижений научно-технического прогресса проблемы социокультурной динамики стали рассматриваться в контексте технико-технологических изменений в жизни общества. В частности, в социальной философии получила распространение технократическая концепция, согласно которой мировая история проходит аграрно-ремесленный, индустриально-промышленный и постиндустриальный (информационный) этапы развития. Переход от одного этапа к другому связан с революциями в технике, технологиях и науке, а также со сменой доминирующего сектора экономики (сельское хозяйство, промышленность, сфера услуг, производство знаний и информации). В настоящее время понимание общества как самоорганизующейся и саморазвивающейся системы осуществляется на основе новой – синергетической – методологии социального познания. Ее суть в том, что изменения в такого рода системах связаны с появлением и действием не только организованных (планируемых, контролируемых), но и спонтанных факторов. Подобная методология позволяет создать новую нелинейную модель социального развития. Она объясняет крупномасштабные социальные трансформации действием малых, случайных факторов, которые, укореняясь в жизненном пространстве социума, ведут к его кардинальным преобразованиям в целом. Примером может служить становление современной информационной цивилизации, формирование которой началось с инновационных разработок исследователей известной «Кремниевой долины», а также изобретений гениальных одиночек (Б. Гейтс, С. Джобс, С. Брин, Л. Пэйдж и др.). На волне достижений современной научно-технологической революции идет процесс формирования глобального общества. Глобализация – это процесс интеграции во всех сферах жизни мирового сообщества на основе мирового разделения труда, деятельности ТНК и формирования глобального рынка, деятельности международных политических и правовых институтов, СМИ и Интернета, стандартизации образования, массовизации культуры, международного сотрудничества ученых, экспансии английского языка и т. д. Все это открывает перспективы нового мирового порядка, новых форм международного сотрудничества и развития человеческого капитала. Вместе с тем, процесс глобализации чреват серьезными проблемами и противоречиями, в том числе перспективой «столкновения цивилизаций» (С. Хантингтон), кризисом традиционных социальных институтов, инфляцией ценностей, нравственной деградацией человека, разрушением экологической среды. input:,output: “Учебная литература Алексеев, П. В. Философия : учебник / П. В. Алексеев, А. В. Панин. – М., 1997. – С. 122. Из понимания истины как объективной, не зависящей от индивидов, классов, человечества, следует ее конкретность. Конкретность истины – это зависимость знания от связей и взаимодействий, присущих тем или иным явлениям, от условий, мест и времени, в которых они существуют и развиваются. Реализацию принципа конкретности можно видеть из примера: утверждение «вода кипит при 100 градусах Цельсия» правильно при наличии нормального атмосферного давления (760 мм ртутного столба) и неправильно при отсутствии этого условия. Еще пример из области социального познания; он касается оценки марксизма французским экзистенциалистом Ж.-П. Сартром. «Марксизм, – писал он, – был самой радикальной попыткой прояснения исторического процесса в его тотальности». Именно поэтому «марксизм остается философией нашего времени: его невозможно превзойти, так как обстоятельства, его породившие, еще не исчезли» (J.-P. Sartre. Critique de la raison dialectique. Paris, 1960. P. 29). Изменение же капитализма, переход его в монополистический, а затем и в постмонополистическую форму требует, конечно, и соответствующего изменения социальной, экономической теории капитализма. В понятие конкретной истины включается указание на время. Имеется в виду время существования объекта и момент или период его отражения субъектом. Если же «время объекта» или «время субъекта» меняется, то знание может потерять свою объективность. Таким образом, абстрактной истины нет, истина всегда конкретна. Конкретность включается в объективную истину. Вследствие этого понятие истины неотъемлемо от ее развития, от понятия творчества, необходимого для дальнейшей разработки и развития знания. ?

Это не пиши, то что в скобках) 1. Что такое познание? Ответ: Познание – это деятельность социального субъекта, направленная на получение знаний о мире и человеке. 2. На каких уровнях осуществляется познавательная активность человека? Ответ: Познавательная активность человека осуществляется на двух уровнях – чувственном и рациональном. 3. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-практическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-практическому уровню познания относятся обыденное познание, мифологическое познание, религиозное познание и художественное познание. 4. Какие формы познания относятся к духовно-теоретическому уровню? Ответ: К духовно-теоретическому уровню познания относятся философское и научное познание. 5. Какие рациональные методы познания были выработаны античными философами? Ответ: Рациональными методами познания, выработанными античными философами, являются индукция, дедукция, анализ и синтез. 6. В какую эпоху гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса? Ответ: В эпоху Просвещения гносеологическая проблематика выдвигается в центр философского дискурса. 7. В чем суть гносеологических позиций оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков?Ответ: Гносеологические позиции оптимистов, скептиков, агностиков и догматиков заключаются в следующем: оптимисты считают, что мир принципиально познаваем в своей сущности; скептики сомневаются в этой способности человека; агностики считают, что мир в своей сущности принципиально непознаваем; догматики считают, что истина уже открыта и дальнейшее познание не нужно. 8. Каковы основные уровни познавательного процесса? Ответ: Основными уровнями познавательного процесса являются чувственный и рациональный уровень. 9. В чем заключаются особенности и каковы формы чувственного познания? Ответ: Чувственное познание возникает вследствие непосредственного взаимодействия человека с миром и образует фундамент всего «здания» человеческого познания. Формами чувственного познания являются ощущения (отражение отдельных сторон вещей или внутренних состояний человека), восприятия (целостное отображение предметов и явлений действительности) и представления (воспроизводство и производство в сознании человека чувственных образов благодаря памяти и воображению). 10. Какие формы относятся к рациональному уровню познания? Ответ: К рациональному (логическому) уровню познания относятся понятия, суждения и умозаключения. 11. Какие существуют виды интуиции? Ответ: Интуиция бывает двух видов: интеллектуальная и чувственная. 12. В чем особенности рационализма как одной из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени? Ответ: Рационализм как одна из гносеологических парадигм философии Нового времени характеризуется тем, что он считает разум основным источником познания и критерием истины. Рационалисты утверждают, что разум способен познать мир независимо от чувственного опыта, и что истина является объективной и независимой от субъекта познания.” “Учебная литература 1. Яскевич, Я. С.

На протяжении веков, со времени зарождения научного познания, вера в силу разума сопровождалась сомнением: как будут использованы его плоды? Является ли знание силой, служащей человеку, и не обернется ли оно против него? …Развитие генной инженерии и близких ей областей знания, да и не их одних, заставляет во многом по-новому осмысливать и тесную связь свободы и ответственности в деятельности ученых. На протяжении веков многим из них не только словом, но и делом приходилось утверждать и отстаивать прин- цип свободы научного поиска перед лицом догматического невежества, фана- тизма суеверий, просто предубеждений. Ответственность же ученого при этом выступала прежде всего как ответственность за получение и распространение проверенных, обоснованных и строгих знаний, позволяющих рассеивать мрак невежества. Сегодня же принцип свободы научного поиска должен осмысливаться в контексте тех далеко не однозначных последствий развития науки, с которыми приходится иметь дело людям. В нынешних дискуссиях по социально- этическим проблемам науки наряду с защитой ничем не ограничиваемой сво- боды исследования представлена и диаметрально противоположная точка зре- ния, предлагающая регулировать науку точно так же, как регулируется движе- ние на железных дорогах. Между этими крайними позициями располагается широкий диапазон мнений о возможности и желательности регулирования ис- следований и о том, как при этом должны сочетаться интересы самого исследо- вателя, научного сообщества и общества в целом». ? В чем суть социальной ответственности ученого, и почему для совре- менной науки данный вопрос является особенно актуальным? ”,“Ответ: Социальная ответственность ученого заключается в осознании им последствий своей деятельности и в принятии мер по минимизации негативных последствий и максимизации положительных. Для современной науки этот вопрос особенно актуален, поскольку развитие науки и технологий приводит к появлению новых проблем, таких как генетическая инженерия, искусственный интеллект, климатические изменения, которые требуют от ученых не только профессионализма, но и высокой степени социальной ответственности.” \\" Упражнения по первоисточникам 1.

В чем польза занятий наукой для человека, по мнению Ф. Бэкона? “,“Ответ: По мнению Ф. Бэкона, занятия наукой приносят человеку пользу, поскольку они: - совершенствуют природу человека, развивая его разум и способности; - помогают человеку научиться применять свои знания на практике, используя опыт и мудрость; - вырабатывают у человека способность критически мыслить и принимать взвешенные решения; - расширяют кругозор человека и помогают ему лучше понимать окружающий мир; - делают жизнь человека более насыщенной и интересной.” ” Закончите определения: «Наука – форма… деятельности человека». «Наука – это система достоверных…». «Наука – это… по производству научных знаний». «Наука – это социальный…». «Метод – это… исследования, …организации познавательной деятельности». \\",“1.

Современные идеологемы общества знания получили свое оформление в лоне концепции постиндустриальной модернизации и становления информационного общества. Данный подход акцентирует внимание на исключительной роли и значении информации и знаний, интеллектуально-образовательного ресурса и высоких (наукоемких) технологий в развитии социума. В социально-типологическом плане феномен общества, основанного на знании, следует изучать в структуре процессов формирования информационного общества, которые составляют от- дельный вектор постиндустриального развития. Именно в информационном обществе информация и знания рассматриваются в качестве важнейшего фак- тора как экономического, так и социально-культурного прогресса. При этом имеется в виду не любое знание, а в первую очередь новое теоретическое зна- ние, что особым образом актуализирует роль и значение фундаментальной науки, естественно, в ее тесной связи с образовательной и производственно- технологической практикой. Наука, пройдя классический и неклассический этапы своей эволюции, ныне развивается на постнеклассической основе. Этому способствовали рево- люция в производстве и хранении знаний (компьютеризация науки), невозмож- ность решить ряд научных задач без комплексного использования различных научных дисциплин, включая социально-гуманитарные (гуманитаризация науки), учета места и роли человека в исследуемых системах (гуманизация науки). Объектами исследования становятся сложные, уникальные, историче- ски развивающиеся системы, которые характеризуются открытостью и само- развитием. Среди них такие природные комплексы, в которые включен и сам человек, – так называемые «человекомерные комплексы»; медико-биологиче- ские, экологические, биотехнологические объекты, системы «человек – маши- на», включающие в себя информационные системы и системы искусственного интеллекта. ? Каковы ключевые черты общества, основанного на знании?","output":"Ответ: - Акцент на роли информации и знаний: Общество, основанное на знании, придаёт особое значение информации и знаниям как основным факторам экономического и социально-культурного прогресса. - Важность нового теоретического знания: В таком обществе не просто знания в целом, а новое теоретическое знание признаётся драйвером развития, что подчёркивает важность фундаментальной науки. - Связь науки с практикой: Фундаментальная наука тесно связана с образовательной и производственно-технологической практикой. - Постнеклассическая стадия развития науки: Наука развивается не просто как набор знаний, а как динамичная система, включающая многопрофильный подход и интеграцию различных научных дисциплин. - Ориентация на сложные системы: Характер исследований в таком обществе подразумевает изучение сложных и уникальных систем, которые отличаются открытостью и способностью к саморазвитию. - Включение человека в исследования: Важным аспектом является изучение систем, где человек является неотъемлемой частью, в том числе искусственный интеллект и информационные системы."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, plausible, year-by-year alternate history timeline for an alternate version of the strategy video fangame series Kaiserreich, with no references to this being an alternate history timeline at all or the OTL timeline, in which Japan's rise to become a global superpower that started in the 1970s and continued until the 2010s continues unabated, with no \\"lost decade\\" or financial crisis to stop said growth.

Here is a potential timeline for this alternate history: 1979: During the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is decimated by joint PLAAF and US Air Force bombings. The Empire of Vietnam is restored with covert Japanese assistance. Vietnam expels Chinese forces and annexes Laos, Cambodia, and Cantonia, forming the Nanyue Kingdom. Khmer Rouge atrocities are exposed, causing global outrage against the PRC and USA. 1980: The Gwangju Uprising triggers a democratization wave in Korea, leading to the fall of both South and North Korean governments. Japan swiftly moves in, merging the two territories into Chōsen, and assimilates the Korean ruling family and military elite into Japanese society. 1988: Following Chiang Ching Kuo’s death in Taiwan, Lee Teng Hui, a former Imperial Japanese Army soldier, rises to power. Taiwan, under the restored name of Formosa, is re-annexed by Japan. The Ming royal family’s descendants are integrated into the Japanese nobility, and KMT loyalists are systematically dealt with. 1989: The Tiananmen Square protests evolve into a full-blown revolution against the CCP, leading to the collapse of the PRC. Manchuria and Mengjiang are re-established as Japanese protectorates. Tibet gains independence, and East Turkestan revives the Kumul Khanate and Chagatai royal dynasty. The Ming are restored to power in a de facto federation closely aligned with Japan. Post-Cold War: With the disintegration of both the USA and the USSR, Japan capitalizes on the instability. The Far Eastern Republic is resurrected on Russia’s east coast, and Japan reclaims Karafuto and the Kurils. Siberia gains independence, supported by Japan. Meanwhile, Japan backs a Habsburg restoration movement in North America, opposing an Anglo-supported Neo Confederacy movement. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s: Japan continues its economic expansion without major setbacks, establishing a network of vassal states and protectorates. It invests heavily in technology, infrastructure, and military advancements, presenting itself as a stabilizing force in Asia and beyond. 2010-2020: Japan's influence extends into global economic institutions, and it spearheads several major international initiatives. By the 2010s, Japan dominates the Asia-Pacific region both economically and politically, and its soft power is felt worldwide through cultural exports and diplomatic initiatives. 2020s: Japan emerges as an unchallenged global superpower, with its vision of a new world order widely accepted. The regional powerhouses it has fostered in Vietnam, Korea, and formerly Chinese territories provide support in shaping international relations and global economics.

Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students. Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings. Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective. Actual Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds.

Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective. Actual Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M TOPIC 1.2 Mass Spectroscopy of Elements Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. TOPIC 1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.A Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. TOPIC 1.4 Composition of Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. TOPIC 1.5 Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. TOPIC 1.6 Photoelectron Spectroscopy ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. TOPIC 1.7 Periodic Trends Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. TOPIC 1.8 Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. TOPIC 2.1 Types of Chemical Bonds Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.A Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. TOPIC 2.2 Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.B Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. TOPIC 2.3 Structure of Ionic Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.C Represent an ionic solid with a particulate model that is consistent with Coulomb’s law and the properties of the constituent ions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. TOPIC 2.4 Structure of Metals and Alloys Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-3 Atoms or ions bond due to interactions between them, forming molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-3.D Represent a metallic solid and/or alloy using a model to show essential characteristics of the structure and interactions present in the substance. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) TOPIC 2.5 Lewis Diagrams Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SAP-4.A Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.A.1 Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. TOPIC 2.6 Resonance and Formal Charge Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.B Represent a molecule with a Lewis diagram that accounts for resonance between equivalent structures or that uses formal charge to select between nonequivalent structures. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons. TOPIC 2.7 VSEPR and Bond Hybridization Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-4 Molecular compounds are arranged based on Lewis diagrams and Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-4.C Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. X MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING. HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS. Rationale: As currently covered in general chemistry college textbooks, molecular orbital theory is limited to homonuclear molecules in the second period. TOPIC 3.1 Intermolecular Forces Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.A Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when: a. The molecules are of the same chemical species. b. The molecules are of two different chemical species. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. TOPIC 3.2 Properties of Solids Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-5 Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-5.B Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. TOPIC 3.3 Solids, Liquids, and Gases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-6 Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-6.A Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulatelevel model. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. TOPIC 3.4 Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.A Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. TOPIC 3.5 Kinetic Molecular Theory Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.B Explain the relationship between the motion of particles and the macroscopic properties of gases with: a. The kinetic molecular theory (KMT). b. A particulate model. c. A graphical representation. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. TOPIC 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-7 Gas properties are explained macroscopically—using the relationships among pressure, volume, temperature, moles, gas constant—and molecularly by the motion of the gas. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-7.C Explain the relationship among non-ideal behaviors of gases, interparticle forces, and/or volumes. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures TOPIC 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.A Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution TOPIC 3.8 Representations of Solutions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.B Using particulate models for mixtures: a. Represent interactions between components. b. Represent concentrations of components. SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. X COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TOPIC 3.9 Separation of Solutions and Mixtures Chromatography Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. TOPIC 3.10 Solubility Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-3 Interactions between intermolecular forces influence the solubility and separation of mixtures. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-3.C Explain the relationship between the solubility of ionic and molecular compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents, and the intermolecular interactions between particles. SPQ-3.C.2 Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. TOPIC 3.11 Spectroscopy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.A Explain the relationship between a region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the types of molecular or electronic transitions associated with that region. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. TOPIC 3.12 Photoelectric Effect Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.B Explain the properties of an absorbed or emitted photon in relationship to an electronic transition in an atom or molecule. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). TOPIC 3.13 Beer-Lambert Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-8 Spectroscopy can determine the structure and concentration in a mixture of a chemical species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-8.C Explain the amount of light absorbed by a solution of molecules or ions in relationship to the concentration, path length, and molar absorptivity. SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TOPIC 4.1 Introduction for Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.A Identify evidence of chemical and physical changes in matter. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TOPIC 4.2 Net Ionic Equations Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.B Represent changes in matter with a balanced chemical or net ionic equation: a. For physical changes. b. For given information about the identity of the reactants and/or product. c. For ions in a given chemical reaction. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TOPIC 4.3 Representations of Reactions Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.C Represent a given chemical reaction or physical process with a consistent particulate model. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TOPIC 4.4 Physical and Chemical Changes Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-1 A substance that changes its properties, or that changes into a different substance, can be represented by chemical equations. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-1.D Explain the relationship between macroscopic characteristics and bond interactions for: a. Chemical processes. b. Physical processes. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. TOPIC 4.5 Stoichiometry Required Course Content UNIT 4 ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-4 When a substance changes into a new substance, or when its properties change, no mass is lost or gained. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.A Explain changes in the amounts of reactants and products based on the balanced reaction equation for a chemical process. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-4.B Identify the equivalence point in a titration based on the amounts of the titrant and analyte, assuming the titration reaction goes to completion. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-2.A Identify a reaction as acidbase, oxidation-reduction, or precipitation. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced.

TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species.

TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant.

TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-4.B Explain the relationship between the rate of an elementary reaction and the frequency, energy, and orientation of molecular collisions. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-4.C Represent the activation energy and overall energy change in an elementary reaction using a reaction energy profile. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state.

TOPIC 5.7 Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-5 Many chemical reactions occur through a series of elementary reactions. These elementary reactions when combined form a chemical equation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-5.A Identify the components of a reaction mechanism. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-5.B Identify the rate law for a reaction from a mechanism in which the first step is rate limiting. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM.

TOPIC 5.11 Catalysis Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-1 The speed at which a reaction occurs can be influenced by a catalyst. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-1.A Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). TOPIC 6.1 Endothermic and Exothermic Processes Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.A Explain the relationship between experimental observations and energy changes associated with a chemical or physical transformation. ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.C Explain the relationship between the transfer of thermal energy and molecular collisions. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. TOPIC 6.4 Heat Capacity and Calorimetry Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.D Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing heating/ cooling based on the amount of the substance, the heat capacity, and the change in temperature. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. TOPIC 6.5 Energy of Phase Changes Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.E Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. TOPIC 6.6 Introduction to Enthalpy of Reaction Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-2 Changes in a substance’s properties or change into a different substance requires an exchange of energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-2.F Calculate the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a chemical reaction in relationship to the amount of the reacting substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of reaction. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. X THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. TOPIC 6.7 Bond Enthalpies Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.A Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. TOPIC 6.8 Enthalpy of Formation Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.B Calculate the enthalpy change for a chemical or physical process based on the standard enthalpies of formation.

EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants TOPIC 6.9 Hess’s Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-3 The energy exchanged in a chemical transformation is required to break and form bonds. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-3.C Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps. ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TOPIC 7.1 Introduction to Equilibrium Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.A Explain the relationship between the occurrence of a reversible chemical or physical process, and the establishment of equilibrium, to experimental observations. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TOPIC 7.2 Direction of Reversible Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-6 Some reactions can occur in both forward and reverse directions, sometimes proceeding in each direction simultaneously. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-6.B Explain the relationship between the direction in which a reversible reaction proceeds and the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-7.A Represent the reaction quotient Qc p or Q , for a reversible reaction, and the corresponding equilibrium expressions Kc = Qc or K p = Qp . TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TOPIC 7.4 Calculating the Equilibrium Constant Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING TRA-7 A system at equilibrium depends on the relationships between concentrations, partial pressures of chemical species, and equilibrium constant K.

TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.A Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Châtelier's principle. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE TRA-8.B Explain the relationships between Q, K, and the direction in which a reversible reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality TOPIC 7.11 Introduction to Solubility Equilibria Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.A Calculate the solubility of a salt based on the value of K sp for the salt. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.B Identify the solubility of a salt, and/or the value of K sp for the salt, based on the concentration of a common ion already present in solution. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt.

X COMPUTATIONS OF SOLUBILITY AS A TOPIC 7.14 Free Energy of Dissolution Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-5 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process that can be influenced by environmental factors such as pH or other dissolved ions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-5.D Explain the relationship between the solubility of a salt and changes in the enthalpy and entropy that occur in the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.A Calculate the values of pH and pOH, based on Kw and the concentration of all species present in a neutral solution of water. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. TOPIC 8.2 pH and pOH of Strong Acids and Bases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.B Calculate pH and pOH based on concentrations of all species in a solution of a strong acid or a strong base. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. TOPIC 8.3 Weak Acid and Base Equilibria Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.C Explain the relationship among pH, pOH, and concentrations of all species in a solution of a monoprotic weak acid or weak base. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). TOPIC 8.4 Acid-Base Reactions and Buf fers Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.D Explain the relationship among the concentrations of major species in a mixture of weak and strong acids and bases. SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). TOPIC 8.5 Acid-Base Titrations Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.E Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components. SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X COMPUTATION OF THE CONCENTRATION Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. TOPIC 8.6 Molecular Structure of Acids and Bases Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-9 The chemistry of acids and bases involves reversible proton-transfer reactions, with equilibrium concentrations being related to the strength of the acids and bases involved. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-9.F Explain the relationship between the strength of an acid or base and the structure of the molecule or ion. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. TOPIC 8.7 pH and pKa Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.A Explain the relationship between the predominant form of a weak acid or base in solution at a given pH and the pKa of the conjugate acid or the pKb of the conjugate base. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. TOPIC 8.8 Properties of Buf fers Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.B Explain the relationship between the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH and the reactions that occur when an acid or a base is added to a buffered solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. TOPIC 8.9 HendersonHasselbalch Equation Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.C Identify the pH of a buffer solution based on the identity and concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair used to create the buffer. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] HA X X COMPUTATION OF THE CHANGE IN pH TOPIC 8.10 Buffer Capacity Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-10 A buffered solution resists changes to its pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-10.D Explain the relationship between the buffer capacity of a solution and the relative concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base components of the solution. SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. TOPIC 9.1 Introduction to Entropy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.A Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. TOPIC 9.2 Absolute Entropy and Entropy Change Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.B Calculate the entropy change for a chemical or physical process based on the absolute entropies of the species involved in the process. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants TOPIC 9.3 Gibbs Free Energy and Thermodynamic Favorability Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.C Explain whether a physical or chemical process is thermodynamically favored based on an evaluation of ∆Go . ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . ENE-4.C.2 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When for the process, it is said to be ENE-4.C.3 The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of as shown in the table below: Symbols favored at: < 0 > 0 < > all T > 0 < 0 > < no T > 0 > 0 > > high T < 0 < 0 < < low T In cases where no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). TOPIC 9.4 Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-4 Some chemical or physical processes cannot occur without intervention. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-4.D Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate. ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. TOPIC 9.5 Free Energy and Equilibrium Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.A Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, ΔGo , and T. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). TOPIC 9.6 Coupled Reactions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-5 The relationship between ΔG° and K can be used to determine favorability of a chemical or physical transformation. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-5.B Explain the relationship between external sources of energy or coupled reactions and their ability to drive thermodynamically unfavorable processes. ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. TOPIC 9.7 Galvanic (Voltaic) and Electrolytic Cells Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.A Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. TOPIC 9.8 Cell Potential and Free Energy Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. R LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.B Explain whether an electrochemical cell is thermodynamically favored, based on its standard cell potential and the constituent half-reactions within the cell. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo TOPIC 9.9 Cell Potential Under Nonstandard Conditions Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ENE-6.C Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential. ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. TOPIC 9.10 Electrolysis and Faraday’s Law Required Course Content ENDURING UNDERSTANDING ENE-6 Electrical energy can be generated by chemical reactions.
