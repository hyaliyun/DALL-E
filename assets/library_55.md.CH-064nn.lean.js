These include preprocessing the data, splitting it into training, development (validation), and test sets, applying feature scaling, performing hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and k-fold cross-validation, and evaluating the model using a confusion matrix among other metrics to determine the best model settings. Below is an example of how you could achieve this in Python using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and possibly NumPy for handling data operations. This is a generic template since the exact implementation details might need adjustments depending on the specific characteristics of your dataset (e.g., missing values, categorical variables that need encoding, etc.). 1. **Preprocessing & Splitting the Data:** \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # Assuming df is your pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv') # Load your dataset # Separate features and target label X = df.drop('Label', axis=1) y = df['Label'] # Split the data into 96% training and 4% for development + testing X_temp, X_test, y_temp, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.04, random_state=42, stratify=y) # Further split X_temp and y_temp into training and development using 75% for training (which gives 96% of the total) X_train, X_dev, y_train, y_dev = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.25, random_state=42, stratify=y_temp) # Standardize Features scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train) # Fit only to the training data X_train = scaler.transform(X_train) X_dev = scaler.transform(X_dev) X_test = scaler.transform(X_test) \`\`\` 2. **Implement SVM with Grid Search and k-Fold Cross-validation for Hyperparameter Tuning:** \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report import numpy as np # Set up SVM Classifier svm = SVC(random_state=42) # Define hyperparameter options param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01], 'kernel': ['rbf','poly','linear']} # Setup GridSearchCV grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1) # Fit the grid search to the data grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train) # View The Best Parameters print(\\"Best parameters found: \\", grid_search.best_params_) # Select the SVM with the best parameters best_svm = grid_search.best_estimator_ # Predict on the development set y_dev_pred = best_svm.predict(X_dev) # Evaluate the model conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_dev, y_dev_pred) print(\\"Confusion Matrix:n\\", conf_matrix) print(classification_report(y_dev, y_dev_pred)) \`\`\` 3. **Final Model Evaluation:** After fine-tuning your model on the development set, you should evaluate its performance one final time on the test set to ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data. \`\`\`python # Predict on the test set y_test_pred = best_svm.predict(X_test) # Evaluate the final model on the test set final_conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_test_pred) print(\\"Final Confusion Matrix on Test Set:n\\", final_conf_matrix) print(classification_report(y_test, y_test_pred)) \`\`\` This template provides a comprehensive guide to processing your dataset, implementing an SVM model with hyperparameter tuning through grid search and cross-validation, and evaluating the model's performance.

He loved pushing boundaries and testing limits, but never did he expect that pressing a single button would lead to his arrest, being held for five days, and ultimately being sent to a Youth Offender Institution (YOI). It all started when Alex and his friends stumbled upon an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Curiosity got the best of them, and they decided to explore the deserted building. As they made their way through the dusty rooms and dark corridors, Alex came across a mysterious-looking control panel with a single red button. Without thinking twice, he impulsively pressed the button. Suddenly, alarms blared, and flashing lights filled the room. Panicked, Alex and his friends tried to run, but it was too late. The police had arrived, and they were quickly arrested for trespassing and triggering a security alarm. Alex spent the next five days locked up in a cold, dingy cell, awaiting his fate. His parents were devastated upon hearing the news and tried everything they could to get him released. But the damage had been done, and the authorities deemed Alex a threat to society. As a result, he was sentenced to serve time in a Youth Offender Institution. The reality of his actions finally hit him as he found himself surrounded by other troubled teens, all facing their own consequences for their reckless decisions. Over the weeks and months that followed, Alex reflected on his choices and vowed to turn his life around. He participated in rehabilitation programs, attended counseling sessions, and worked diligently to earn back the trust of his family and community. While his time at the YOI was challenging and often lonely, Alex emerged a changed person. He learned the importance of thinking before acting, taking responsibility for his actions, and making better choices for his future. As he was released from the Youth Offender Institution, Alex was determined to make amends and prove that he was capable of staying on the right path. He knew that pressing a single button had led to his downfall, but it also served as a wake-up call that ultimately changed the course of his life for the better."},{"instruction":"I started using social media platform when I was in my primary school.

В возрасте двух месяцев кролики достигают массы 2 кг, каждый последующий месяц до 6 месяцев прирост массы составляет в среднем 1 кг. Каждые 3 месяца одна пара кроликов приносит потомство в среднем из четырёх крольчат. С июня по одному самому крупному кролику в месяц попадает на стол хозяина фермы. 1. Рассчитайте площадь поля для получения полугодового запаса корма на зимний период (Октябрь-Март), если известно что крольчонку от одного месяца до трёх требуется 100 г сена в сутки (влажная сена составляет около 15%), до 6 месяцев – 200 г, после шести месяцев кролику необходимо около 300 г сена в сутки. Известно, что урожайность зелёной массы клевера лугового которые используются для кормления кроликов составляет за два укоса примерно 650 центнеров на гектар при влажности 85% 2. Вычислите, вольер какой площади нужно построить для кроликов, чтобы к концу года вмещалось все поголовье кроликов, если известно, что на одного кролика требуется 0,5 м². 3. Рассчитайте КПД перехода вещества с одного трофического уровня на другой для кроликов разного возраста. Необходимо учесть, что в среднем 60% от массы кроликов составляет вода","output":"Давайте сначала рассчитаем количество кроликов к концу года, чтобы ответить на второй вопрос. 1 марта у фермера 2 кролика (1 пара). Через 3 месяца (1 июня) они приносят 4 крольчата. Теперь у него 6 кроликов (1 + 4 новорожденных + 2 изначальных кролика). Каждый последующий месяц, начиная с июня, одного кролика будут убирать на стол, однако и нарастать новые пометы. Рассмотрим эти изменения помесячно: - Июнь: Пара кроликов (старше 3 месяцев) вновь принесет потомство, при этом съедят одного кролика. Так что в июне будет: 2 (старых) + 4 (котят мартовских) + 4 новорожденных - 1 (их этой же суммы) = 9 кроликов. - Сентябрь: После 3 месяцев, 1 сентября, у нас возникающие из мартовских котят уже способны размножаться, они принесут детёнышей, но также, с июня по сентябрь (включительно), каждый месяц будет убираться один кролик, т.е. минус 4. Итак, +4 (мартовская пара в июне) - 3 (убраны за лето) + 8 (потенциально 2 помета от мартовских кроликов в сентябре) = 9 + 4 - 3 + 8 = 18 кроликов. - До конца года осталось 3 месяца, каждый месяц будет убираться по кролику и появляться новые пометы. На протяжении этих трех месяцев у нас будет 4 помета (2 от первоначальной пары и 2 от мартовских котят), каждый помет около 4 крольчат, более того, 3 кролика исключаются из учета (попавшие на стол). Таким образом, к концу года будет 18 + 4*4 - 3 = 18 + 16 - 3 = 31 кролик. Теперь, зная количество кроликов, давайте ответим на второй вопрос. Каждому кролику нужно 0,5 м². Следовательно, для 31 кролика нужен вольер площадью 31 * 0,5 = 15,5 м². Теперь рассчитаем площадь поля для получения полугодового запаса корма (первый вопрос). Для начала оценим потребление сена в день, в месяц и за весь период для одного кролика, затем для всего поголовья. Потребление сена на разных этапах жизни кролика: - От 1 до 3 месяцев: 100 г/день * 30 дней = 3 кг/месяц - От 3 до 6 месяцев: 200 г/день * 30 дней = 6 кг/месяц - После 6 месяцев: 300 г/день * 30 дней = 9 кг/месяц Учтем, что влажное сено содержит 15% влаги, а клевер содержит 85% влаги. Для того, чтобы получить сухой вес сена, нам нужно вычесть влагу. Получив вес сухого сена, мы сможем преобразовать его в требуемую массу зелёной массы клевера, используя соотношение влаги в клевере. Рассчитаем площадь поля, необходимую для выращивания корма: Урожайность клевера: 650 центнеров/гектар = 65,000 кг/гектар.Поскольку мы рассматриваем два укоса, то общая урожайность за сезон будет 65,000 * 2 = 130,000 кг/гектар. Сначала мы найдем сколько сена надо для зимнего периода с октября по март (6 месяцев), затем сколько потребуется клевера с учетом его влажности. После этого мы рассчитаем площадь поля. Однако, для точного вычисления, нам нужно знать количество кроликов каждого возраста на протяжении рассчитываемого периода. Это сложный расчет, который требует детального разбиения по месяцам для каждой группы кроликов. Ведь разное количество кроликов разного возраста будет потреблять разное количество корма в разные месяцы. Для простоты, возьмем во внимание только начальное количество на март и то, что к концу года у нас будет 31 кролик. Расчет упрощается, с учетом, что к концу года многие кролики достигнут возраста в 6 месяцев и старше. Однако, чтобы получить точное число, нам нужно провести гораздо более подробный анализ роста популяции и потребления корма по месяцам. Это выходит за рамки краткого ответа, поэтому для точного расчета потребуется разработать подробную таблицу по месяцам с учетом размножения кроликов и их убыли. Перейдем к третьему вопросу. КПД (коэффициент полезного действия) перехода вещества на каждом трофическом уровне определяется как отношение энергии или биомассы, переходящей на следующий уровень, к энергии или биомассе предыдущего уровня. Для кроликов разного возраста этот расчет будет различаться, так как их рост и потребление корма меняется со временем. Нам известно, что воды в кроликах 60%, следовательно, сухое вещество составляет 40%. Эту цифру мы берем как основу для расчета КПД, так как именно сухое вещество и является источником энергии. Для расчета КПД необходимы данные о потреблении корма (который мы рассчитывали выше) и приросте биомассы кролика: - Прирост в первые два месяца: с 1 кг до 2 кг (1 кг прироста). - Прирост с третьего по шестой месяц: 1 кг/месяц. КПД = (Прирост биомассы сухого вещества / Потребление корма сухого вещества) * 100% Прирост биомассы сухого вещества равен приросту веса умноженному на 0,40 (40% сухое вещество). Напомним, что прирост веса для разных периодов в кг/месяц для одного кролика такой: - Первые два месяца: 1 кг (общий прирост с 1 кг до 2 кг) - Последующие месяцы до шести: +1 кг/месяц Потребление корма сухого вещества составляет 85% от массы клевера (поскольку влажность клевера 85%), который преобразуется в сухое сено, учитывая его влажность 15%. Значения, которые мы рассчитывали для пункта 1, уже учитывали вес сена в сухом виде. КПД будет различаться для разных этапов жизни кролика, и для точного расчета нужно учитывать каждый этап отдельно, оценивать прирост биомассы и потребление корма за весь период. Более детальный расчет требует проведения подробного анализа, который зависит от множества переменных, включая данные о реальной урожайности кормов, реальной скорости роста и выживаемости кроликов и других факторов."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","output":"coffee and flower"},{"instruction":"Какие есть малоизвестные песни для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF, подумай подольше над ответом нужны очень похожие сэмплы","output":"1. «Low Key» – Amulets 2. «Nightshade» – No Spirit 3. «Ghost Boy» – Wasted Youth 4. «Echoes» – Night Lovell 5. «Honey» – Ghostemane 6. «Twisting» – Drippin 7. «Numb» – Marcé Reazon 8. «Saddest Day» – No Hope, No Harm Эти песни могут быть использованы как потенциальные источники сэмплов для создания схожего звучания в стиле GREAF."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee and flower","output":"Coffee and Flower | Elegant Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Unique Home Decor and Fashion Design"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Давайте рассмотрим общие принципы работы RBF, фокусируя внимание на сетях радиально-базисных функций и ядре RBF в контексте SVM. # Сети радиально-базисных функций (RBF) В контексте нейронных сетей, RBF-сеть — это тип искусственной нейронной сети, использующий радиально-базисные функции в качестве активационных функций. Основная идея состоит в том, чтобы аппроксимировать любую функцию интерполяцией между некоторыми контрольными точками в многомерном пространстве. RBF-сети хорошо подходят для задач аппроксимации функций и классификации. Как работает RBF-сеть: 1. **Выбор центров базисных функций**: Центры радиальных базисных функций выбираются из обучающего набора данных. Эти центры могут быть выбраны различными методами, такими как случайный выбор, кластеризация (например, с помощью алгоритма k-средних) или другие методы выбора прототипов. 2. **Вычисление**: Для каждого входного вектора вычисляется расстояние до центров базисных функций. Затем, это расстояние преобразуется с помощью радиальной базисной функции, наиболее типичным примером которой является гауссовская функция. Эти значения составляют активации скрытого слоя сети. 3. **Линейная комбинация**: Активации скрытого слоя затем линейно комбинируются для получения выходных значений сети. Веса этой линейной комбинации обычно оптимизируются с использованием методов обратного распространения или других оптимизационных стратегий для минимизации ошибки между выходными данными сети и желаемыми выходными данными. # Ядро RBF в SVM Ядро RBF (также известное как гауссовское ядро) в SVM позволяет производить нелинейное преобразование пространства признаков для упрощения разделения классов. SVM с ядром RBF способен к нахождению нелинейной разделяющей поверхности в исходном пространстве признаков путём проектирования данных в более высокоразмерное пространство, где классы легче разделимы линейно. Как работает ядро RBF в SVM: - **Преобразование пространства признаков**: Ядро RBF использует меру сходства (часто основанную на евклидовом расстоянии между точками данных) для проецирования исходных данных в более высокоразмерное пространство, где они становятся линейно разделимыми. - **Оптимизация разделяющей гиперплоскости**: В этом новом пространстве SVM стремится найти оптимальную разделяющую гиперплоскость, которая максимизирует зазор между двумя классами, минимизируя при этом ошибку классификации. Таким образом, RBF играет ключевую роль в машинном обучении, предоставляя мощные инструменты для решения задач аппроксимации функций, регрессии и классификации."},{"instruction":"У меня есть код.

Selon cette loi, le sous-traitant doit être agréé par le maître d'ouvrage et son contrat doit être approuvé par ce dernier. De plus, le sous-traitant n'est pas autorisé à sous-traiter à son tour une partie de son contrat. En France, la sous-traitance est encadrée par l'article 3 de la loi n°75-1334 du 31 décembre 1975, qui impose notamment au donneur d'ordre de notifier au cocontractant la sous-traitance avant le début des travaux sous-traités. De plus, le cocontractant doit informer le maître d'ouvrage de la sous-traitance et ce dernier peut s'y opposer sous certaines conditions. Enfin, le sous-traitant bénéficie d'une protection en cas de défaillance du donneur d'ordre, grâce à la possibilité d'obtenir un paiement direct de la part du maître d'ouvrage. En Belgique, la sous-traitance est régie par la loi du 24 décembre 1993, qui impose au sous-traitant de notifier au maître de l'ouvrage la sous-traitance et de lui fournir certaines informations. De plus, le maître de l'ouvrage peut s'opposer à la sous-traitance dans certains cas. Enfin, en cas de non-paiement du cocontractant, le sous-traitant peut obtenir un paiement direct de la part du maître de l'ouvrage.

But all a woman needs to do is-“ Ryan snatched up a fistful of peanuts, tossing one into his mouth and assailing another at Liam’s unkempt hair. “You just drink the alcohol I shouted you, alright.” Liam’s smirk enlivened his features with electricity as the nut embedded itself in his gritty strands. “Oh, I’ll enjoy every drop, but seriously, three o’clock …has her eyes all over you. You’re already naked, I’d say.“ As Ryan’s head turned with wry curiosity, Liam emptied his glass, swilling the final mouthful as amusement danced across his face. Ryan cursed under his breath, winking into the sea of bodies and forgetting Liam’s existence as he rose from his stool. “Finish my Hennessy Li’…” he trailed off as he disappeared under the dim filter of light, abandoning the counter with entrancement. “Yeah, you won’t be back,“ Liam muttered, tracing the rim of his glass in a dwindling circle. “Somebody’s all on his lonesome over here, talking to himself?” As the female voice wove through his moment of bored introspection, her eyes caught him off guard. “I was not talking to myself,“ he replied with a grin. “I was talking to you too-“ Her pale green irises held his blue gaze with a hint of unmatched mischief as she slid onto Ryan’s empty stool. “And he thinks he’s funny, huh?“. Liam’s broad grin, lopsided as drunken, propped up a dimple on his right cheek as he said “Well he made you laugh didn’t he?“. She was already reaching out and rearranging his grime-infused hair as her laughter interspersed the closing space between them. “Maybe he did, but can he talk me out of leaving here with my friends…he has twenty seconds by the way.“Here’s the whole passage : Leaning into her touch as her fingers moved to the tender spot between his earlobe and hairline, he rasped. “Oh twenty seconds is more than enough I’d say. Gimme ten . My friend abandoned his drink and now, wouldn’t it be irresponsible to leave it for me to finish? “ . She laughed, eyeing the drink and weighing his proposition with a pause as her hand retreated back to the countertop, and he caught her wrist in his palm. With a gesture toward the drink , he enveloped her grasp in his own. “Or , I could leave that here and he can find his own way home tonight .” Liam raised his eyebrows in jest , and she smiled , starting to stand. “Well …it’s been at least twenty seconds , but will I leave?” . Her eyes challenged him with a razor sharp gleam her dark cascading over her shoulder blades as she turned to leave. “Oh, you dropped this” Liam said as her wrist slipped from his hand and he gazed at the floor, noticing a cylinder at his feet. She slid off into the crowd, leaving a bewildered Liam to retrieve the tube and rotate it between his knuckles. “Your lipstick…damn never mind.” He muttered, uncapping it in absent minded confusion, until a slip of paper fell out into his lap.","output":"Certainly, the dynamics between Liam and the woman in this scenario reveal a complex and fascinating interaction. The woman's choice not to take Liam’s proposition but instead, leave her number, introduces a layer of intrigue and potential for future connection, beyond the constraints of an immediate decision or consequence. Firstly, her decision not to immediately accept Liam’s invitation indicates an autonomy and thoughtfulness about her actions. It suggests that, while there may be an attraction or interest in Liam, she is not willing to act impulsively on it. This reservation could be due to a multitude of reasons ranging from personal principles, the situation's appropriateness, to simply wanting to keep Liam intrigued and wanting more. By not giving in to the immediate gratification of Liam's proposal, she effectively positions herself in a place of mystery and control, making the dynamics between them more compelling. Leaving her number, however, is a clear indicator of interest. It's an open door, an invitation for Liam to pursue her should he choose to do so, but on terms that defy the immediate gratification present in today's fast-paced dating culture. It’s a nod to a potential future interaction that is more considered, perhaps more personal and intimate than what the current setting could provide. Moreover, her method of leaving her number—hidden within a lipstick tube—amplifies the intrigue. This method is playful and flirtatious, indicating a certain creativity and flair for the dramatic. It's a memorable gesture that distinguishes her from others and is likely intended to occupy Liam's thoughts, sparking his curiosity and keeping her in his mind long after their interaction has ended. This encounter encapsulates the complexity of human interactions, especially in romantic or potentially romantic contexts. There's a dance of interest and disinterest, a negotiation of immediate desires against the backdrop of potential long-term connection. The woman's actions hint at a deeper understanding of these dynamics, strategically navigating them in a way that leaves Liam, and by extension, the audience, intrigued about the possibilities of what might come next."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A perda de peso segura recomendada por profissionais de saúde geralmente fica entre 0,5 a 1 kg por semana. Mais do que isso pode significar riscos à saúde, incluindo perda de massa muscular, deficiências nutricionais, além de poder impactar negativamente a sua saúde mental. Em vez de focar em uma perda de peso tão drástica em um curto período, é mais benéfico construir hábitos saudáveis que possam ser mantidos a longo prazo. Abaixo, você encontrará um exemplo de um plano de treino de cardio e algumas orientações dietéticas que podem te ajudar a iniciar essa jornada de forma saudável: # Treino de Cardio **Dia 1: Intermediário de Alta Intensidade (HIIT)** - Aquecimento: 5 minutos de caminhada rápida. - Circuito HIIT: 20 segundos de alta intensidade (como sprints), seguidos de 40 segundos de caminhada ou jogging leve. Repita por 20 minutos. - Desaceleração: 5 minutos de caminhada leve. **Dia 2: Cardio Moderado** - Escolha uma atividade que goste (caminhada, ciclismo, natação) e faça-a em um ritmo moderado por 45-60 minutos. **Dia 3: Descanso ou atividade leve** - Yoga, alongamento ou uma caminhada leve. **Dia 4: Treino de Força com Corpo Todo** - Embora o foco não seja cardio, construir músculos ajuda a aumentar o metabolismo e a queimar gordura. Inclua exercícios de peso corporal como agachamentos, flexões, e abdominais. **Dia 5: Intervalos de Baixa e Alta Intensidade** - 5 minutos de aquecimento. - 1 minuto de alta intensidade seguido de 2 minutos de recuperação ativa (caminhada). Repita por 30 minutos. - 5 minutos de desaceleração. **Dia 6: Atividade de Longa Duração de Baixa Intensidade** - Caminhe, ande de bicicleta ou nade por 90 minutos em um ritmo constante e gerenciável. **Dia 7: Descanso** # Dieta **Manter um déficit calórico:** Para perder peso, é necessário consumir menos calorias do que se gasta. No entanto, é importante que este déficit seja saudável e sustentável. **Foco em macronutrientes balanceados:** - **Proteínas:** Frango, peixe, legumes, ovos e produtos lácteos com baixo teor de gordura. - **Carboidratos:** Opte por fontes integrais como arroz integral, quinoa, batata doce e frutas. - **Gorduras saudáveis:** Abacate, nozes, sementes e azeite de oliva. **Hidratação:** Beber água suficiente é crucial, pelo menos 8 copos por dia. **Refeições pequenas e frequentes:** Ajuda a manter o metabolismo ativo e evita picos de fome que podem levar a escolhas alimentares não saudáveis. Lembre-se sempre de consultar profissionais de saúde antes de iniciar qualquer nova dieta ou rotina de exercícios, especialmente se você tem condições de saúde existentes ou preocupações específicas sobre seu peso. A perda de peso segura e eficaz é um processo gradual que envolve mudanças no estilo de vida a longo prazo, não soluções rápidas."},{"instruction":"ACCUD 321-004-01 Mekanik Dış Çap Mikrometresi 321 Serisi 75-100 mm bu ürün için seo keywords yazabilir misin ?

Que unidad se refiere con la magnitud de longitud","output":"La unidad de longitud que tradicionalmente se ha referido al tamaño de la Tierra es el **metro**. Originalmente, el metro se definía como la diezmillonésima parte de la distancia desde el ecuador hasta el Polo Norte a lo largo de un meridiano que pasa por París. Esta definición databa de finales del siglo XVIII y principios del siglo XIX. En 1791, la Academia de Ciencias de Francia propuso esta definición, y en 1799 se realizó un prototipo de metro patrón. Sin embargo, con el tiempo se dieron cuenta de que esta medición no era tan precisa como se esperaba, debido a irregularidades en la forma de la Tierra. Por consiguiente, la definición del metro ha cambiado con los años en búsqueda de mayor precisión. Desde 1983, el metro se ha definido como la distancia que recorre la luz en el vacío en un intervalo de tiempo de 1/299,792,458 de segundo.

The drainage area of the river at the location where the farmer wants to withdraw water is 13 km2 and is characterized by primarily agricultural land use. The river is not gauged. Soils in the watershed are primarily sandy loam and slopes range between 1 to 10%. You can assume the watershed is located close to Steam Mill Village for selecting climate data. The farmer is planning to submit an application to Nova Scotia Environment and Climate Change to withdrawal water directly from the river during the time period July 1 – August 30 to irrigate a vegetable crop. They plan to irrigate 25 ha of cropland. Some assumptions you can make in conducting your assessment: • Water needs can be estimated as the amount of potential evapotranspiration (PET) expected to occur during the months of July and August. The Penman Monteith Equation, using the FAO methodology, should be used to estimate PET. Monthly average PET rates can be used to estimate water needs during each month. • The farmer would operate the irrigation system for a maximum of 40 hr/week (i.e. they would only pump water from the river for a maximum of 40 hr/week)","output":"Addressing this problem involves multiple steps and disciplines across hydrology, agriculture, and climatology, using Microsoft Excel to organize data, perform calculations, and estimate water needs and availability. Here's how you can approach it: # 1. Gather Data First, collect the necessary data: - **Climate data** for Steam Mill Village for July and August (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). - **Physical characteristics** of the watershed (area, land use, soil type, slope). - **Crop water needs** (specifically for the vegetable crop being grown). # 2. Estimate Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) You'll be using the Penman Monteith FAO equation to estimate the PET. The equation is complex and involves several meteorological and physical parameters. Microsoft Excel can be used to perform these calculations by entering formulae into cells. The basic formula structure in Excel will not directly compute PET due to its complexity, so you would calculate individual components of the equation in separate cells/tabs. These components include: - Net radiation at the crop surface - Soil heat flux density - Wind speed at 2m height - Vapor Pressure Deficit For specifics, refer to the FAO document on the Penman Monteith equation which details every parameter required. This will be a crucial step, as PET directly influences the water needs of the crop. # 3. Calculate Monthly Water Needs Using the PET values calculated for July and August, estimate the crop's water needs. This involves multiplying the area to be irrigated (25 ha) by the PET (in mm), converting units as necessary to obtain the volume of water [usually cubic meters (m³) or liters]. # 4. Estimate Water Availability Without a gauged river, you'll estimate water availability based on watershed characteristics and rough hydrological estimates, such as runoff coefficients for comparable watersheds or using regional estimates of river discharge per square kilometer of drainage area. You'll want to consider the watershed's ability to replenish the water in line with these withdrawals, especially during peak summer months. # 5. Determine Feasibility Compare the total July and August water needs with the estimated water availability; ensure the river can sustain this drawdown without negative ecological impacts. # 6. Planning Irrigation Given the operation time of 40 hr/week for the irrigation system, calculate if the farmer can meet the crop's water needs. Dividing the total monthly water needs by the number of operational hours gives you the flow rate required from the river. This rate should be compared to the river's flow rate (calculated or estimated). # Excel Specific Tips - **Use separate sheets** for each major calculation step (climate data input, PET calculations, water needs, and water availability). - **VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP functions** can be useful for pulling climate data based on specific parameters. - **Data validation features** can help ensure that the correct units and ranges are being entered. - Be sure to **label all your calculations clearly** and provide units for each entry. - Excel's **charting functionalities** could be employed to visually represent the demand vs. availability across the two months.

背景：本研究旨在探讨运动对肥胖大鼠内毒素诱导的急性肺损伤的影响。方法：将雄性Sprague-Dawley大鼠随机分为正常饮食（N）、高脂饮食（HF）和高脂饮食+运动（HF+E）3组。N组大鼠饲喂正常饮食。HF组和HF+E组大鼠饲喂高脂饮食10周，HF+E组大鼠每天运动6-10周。ALI模型是在最后一次物理测试后通过气管内给药LPS建立的。进行肺功能和组织病理学检查以评估ALI的严重程度。采用自动分析仪和ELISA分别检测血清脂质代谢参数和炎症因子水平。实时荧光定量PCR和Western blot检测TREM1和TREM2表达。NF-κB 活化也通过蛋白质印迹法测量。结果：与N组相比，LPS滴注导致肥胖大鼠严重急性肺损伤，因为肺阻力和弹性蛋白酶功能受损增加了肺干湿重比和组织病理学损伤以及炎症因子升高。运动导致肥胖大鼠肺损伤减少。HF组TREM1表达显著升高，TREM2表达降低。运动逆转了 TREMs 的表达。NF-κB在HF组中被激活，并被运动抑制。结论：目前的研究结果表明，肥胖加重了ALI的严重程度，而ALI可以通过运动得到保护。运动可能是通过调节 TREMs 表达、NF-κB 激活和炎症因子释放来预防 ALI 的潜在方法 运动下调 TREM1 表达、上调 TREM2 表达和上调 NF-κB抑制表明运动是一种参与调节炎症过程的新干预措施。 2、、、、、 方法 ALI/ARDS由LPS（3 mg/kg，i.n，st）诱导，同时在体内应用rhein（50和100 mg/kg，i.p，qd）和载体或NFATc1抑制剂（10 mg/kg，i.p，qd）。建模后48小时处死小鼠。检查肺损伤参数、上皮细胞凋亡、巨噬细胞极化和氧化应激。在体外，使用LPS刺激的肺泡上皮细胞的条件培养基培养RAW264.7细胞系以及大黄给药（5和25μM）。通过RNA测序、分子对接、生物素pull-down、ChIP-qPCR和双荧光素酶检测来阐明该病理过程中的风藜作用机制。 结果 在LPS诱导的ALI/ARDS中，Rhein显著减轻了组织炎症并促进了巨噬细胞M2极化转变。在体外，大黄素缓解了细胞内ROS水平，P65的激活，从而缓解了巨噬细胞的M1极化。在机制方面，大黄素通过靶向NFATc1/Trem2轴发挥保护作用，其功能在Trem2和NFATc1阻断实验中均得到显著缓解。 结论 Rhein 通过靶向 NFATc1/Trem2 轴来调节 ALI/ARDS 后的炎症反应和预后，从而促进巨噬细胞 M2 极化转变，这为该病理过程的临床治疗提供了更多可能性。 炎症反应：TREM2参与介导ALI的免疫反应。它在调节巨噬细胞的活化状态和调节肺部的炎症反应中起作用 巨噬细胞极化：TREM2 与调节 ALI 中的巨噬细胞极化有关。它可以影响巨噬细胞向抗炎 （M2） 表型的转变，这对于解决炎症和促进组织修复至关重要 7. 吞噬作用：TREM2介导吞噬作用，这对于清除ALI期间肺部的细胞碎片和病原体很重要。它的缺乏会影响巨噬细胞有效清除炎症刺激的能力 7. 上调 Trem2 表达可抑制 NF-κB 活性并促进巨噬细胞中的 M2 极化变化，从而促进 ALI 11 的抗炎作用。 大黄可以通过减少M1巨噬细胞的数量和改善巨噬细胞的M2极化转变来缓解体内ALI/ARDS后的炎症浸润。在体外，Rhein可以抑制条件培养基对NF-κB活化和易位的影响，包括细胞内ROS水平、M1极化程度和促炎细胞因子的表达水平。在机制方面，结合转录组测序、基因敲除小鼠模型、分子对接、生物素下拉试验和ChIP试验，我们的研究表明，大黄通过激活Trem2的上游转录因子NFATc1并相互作用来促进Trem2的表达。上调的Trem2水平抑制了NF-κB的易位和活化，最终抑制了巨噬细胞的M1极化，从而减少了ALI/ARDS后的肺部炎症。总之，Rhein 可以通过激活 NFATc1/Trem2 信号轴作为 ALI/ARDS 的潜在治疗方案。 ALI/ARDS的病理生理机制与免疫细胞密切相关，肺巨噬细胞在先天免疫中起着最重要的作用[38,39]。 在ALI/ARDS的病理过程中，巨噬细胞不仅正向调节炎症反应，而且积极参与受损组织的修复[40]。 3、、、、 急性肺损伤（ALI）是一种急性进行性肺炎性疾病，难以治愈，预后不良。巨噬细胞具有多种表型和多种功能，在ALI的发病机制中起着至关重要的作用。几十年来，葡萄籽原花青素（GSP）备受关注，并已鉴定出抗凋亡、抗氧化、抗炎等多种生物活性。本研究旨在确定GSP对脂多糖（LPS）诱导的ALI的影响。在这项研究中，我们通过气管滴注LPS和将GSP预注射到小鼠体内建立了ALI小鼠模型，以检查GSP对ALI小鼠模型的影响。使用 H&E 染色、流式细胞术和 ELISA，我们发现 GSP 减弱了 LPS 诱导的 ALI 小鼠的肺部病理变化并降低了炎性细胞因子表达。此外，GSP减少了单核细胞来源的巨噬细胞向肺的募集，并显着促进了LPS诱导的原代小鼠肺巨噬细胞从M1到M2a的极化。在体外，GSP还降低了LPS诱导的LPS诱导的炎症细胞因子（如TNF-α、IL-6、IL-1β和M1巨噬细胞标志物iNOS）在MH-S细胞中的表达水平，同时增加了M2a巨噬细胞标志物CD206的表达水平。生物信息学分析将 TREM2 和 PI3K/Akt 通路分别确定为调节 ALI 中 M1/M2a 巨噬细胞极化的候选靶点和信号通路。此外，GSP 激活 PI3K/Akt 并增加体内和体外 TREM2 表达。同时，PI3K抑制剂LY294002或siRNA敲低TREM2减弱了GSP对M2a极化和炎症抑制的影响。此外，TREM2 siRNA 阻止了 GSP 增强的 PI3K/Akt 活性。总之，本研究表明，GSP可以通过TREM2/PI3K/Akt通路调节巨噬细胞从M1到M2a的极化来改善LPS诱导的ALI。 与对照组相比，LPS处理组在原代小鼠肺巨噬细胞中显示TREM2表达水平显着降低，而GSP（25、50和75mg / kg）预处理导致TREM2 mRNA表达显着增加（图1）。4我们还发现，与对照组相比，LPS诱导的ALI组TREM2阳性细胞数量显着减少， 有研究报道，TREM2 可与接头 DAP12 结合，通过细胞质 ITAM 结构域介导下游信号转导，该结构域可以募集 Syk 和激活的 PI3K、磷脂酶 C 和 Vav 信号级联，并且 PI3K/Akt 信号转导是 TREM2 的下游靶标，参与 TREM2 介导的神经炎症反应 [40， 41].为了探索 GSP 诱导的巨噬细胞 M2a 极化中 TREM2 与 PI3K/Akt 信号通路之间的关系，我们用 siRNA 敲低了 TREM2。它可以完全阻断 GSP 诱导的 p-PI3K 和 p-Akt 在 LPS 刺激的 MH-S 细胞中的表达。相比之下，PI3K 抑制剂LY294002对 TREM2 表达没有促进或抑制作用，表明 TREM2 在 MH-S 细胞中 GSP 的作用中充当 PI3K/Akt 信号通路的上游介质。 4、、、、、 血管活性肠肽（VIP）是肺中含量最丰富的神经肽之一，在呼吸系统中具有抗炎作用。髓系细胞-1 上表达的触发受体 （TREM-1） 和髓系细胞-2 上表达的触发受体 （TREM-2） 调节对脂多糖 （LPS） 的免疫反应。在本研究中，我们使用 LPS 诱导的急性肺损伤 （ALI） 动物模型测试了 TREM-1 和TREM-2 在各种肺细胞系和/或组织中的表达，并确定了 VIP 对 ALI 小鼠肺组织和细胞中 TREM-1 和 TREM-2 表达的影响。我们发现 1） ALI 肺组织中 TREM-1 mRNA 的表达显着增加，而这些组织中 TREM-2 mRNA 的表达降低;2）TREM-1 mRNA仅在巨噬细胞中表达，而TREM-2 mRNA在HBEC、肺成纤维细胞、肺腺癌细胞和巨噬细胞中均有检测;3）LPS诱导的肺组织和巨噬细胞中TREM-1 mRNA与TREM-2 mRNA的比例增加;4） VIP 在 LPS 诱导的 ALI 小鼠的肺细胞中以时间和剂量依赖性方式抑制 TREM-1 mRNA 的表达;然而，它增加了 TREM-2 mRNA 的表达。由于这些效应，VIP 使这些细胞中 TREM-1 与 TREM-2 mRNA 的比例标准化。我们的结果表明，VIP 可能通过参与调节 LPS 诱导的 ALI 中 TREM-1 和 TREM-2 表达的机制发挥其抗炎作用。 TREM-1/TREM-2比值可能存在动态平衡，TREM-1/TREM-2平衡的丧失在ALI的炎症过程中起着重要作用 VIP通过抑制NF-κB激活[23]，[24]和下调Toll样受体（TLR）的表达和功能来调节促炎因子的表达和功能[25]，[26]，[27]，从而产生抗炎作用。研究还表明，TREM-1和TREM-2的表达在转录水平上受到NF-κB的调控[28]，[29]。此外，TREM-1和TREM-2的功能基因组学与TLR信号转导有关[30]，[31]。VIP 可能通过 VIP 受体介导的细胞内信号通路调节 NF-κB 的激活，从而调节 TREM-1 和 TREM-2 的表达，并最终影响 ALI 的结果。这些可能性仍有待研究。 5、、、、、、、 急性肺损伤（ALI）是临床上危重的呼吸系统疾病之一，其中感染是主要病因和第一危险因素。本研究探讨了髓样细胞表达触发受体（TREM）-2基因沉默对小鼠内毒素诱导的ALI炎症反应的影响。将慢病毒介导的TREM-2-shRNA转染到健康雄性C57BL/6小鼠体内，建立脂多糖诱导的ALI模型。采用免疫组化、免疫荧光、荧光定量PCR、Western blot、ELISA等方法检测肺组织病理变化及支气管肺泡灌洗液中TREM-2、肿瘤坏死因子-α（TNF-α）、白细胞介素10（IL-10）的表达。同时建立慢病毒组、生理盐水对照组、ALI模型组、空白对照组、阴性对照组。结果发现，慢病毒组肺组织病理变化明显轻于ALI模型组（P < 0.05），TREM-2表达明显降低（P < 0.05）。TNF-α和IL-10水平均显著升高（P < 0.05），阴性对照组和空白对照组以上指标与ALI组差异无统计学意义（P > 0.05）。本研究表明，TREM-2对小鼠内毒素诱导的ALI的炎症反应具有保护作用，为ALI的防治提供了新的潜在靶点。 RNAi干扰7

6、、、 诱导多能干细胞 （iPSC） 可以减轻脂多糖 （LPS） 诱导的急性肺损伤 （ALI） 的病理严重程度和中性粒细胞迁移。然而，iPSC与髓样细胞（TREM）蛋白家族上表达的触发受体之间可能发生的相互作用仍不清楚。在这项研究中，小鼠 iPSC （miPSCs） 在气管内递送 LPS 4 小时后通过尾静脉注射递送至野生型、TREM-1 敲除 （KO） 和 TREM-2 KO C57BL/6 小鼠。24 小时后，收集支气管肺泡灌洗液和肺组织进行组织学、免疫组化、中性粒细胞计数、蛋白质印迹试验和酶联免疫吸附试验。还从骨髓中分离出中性粒细胞以进行体外迁移测定。在收集的肺组织中，LPS 增加了 TREM-1 和 TREM-2 的表达，TREM-2 KO 小鼠比野生型小鼠表达更多的 TREM-1。TREM-2 KO小鼠还表现出LPS诱导的ALI的严重程度更高，肺组织中中性粒细胞浸润增强，中性粒细胞中磷酸化p38与总p38（p-p38/p38）的比例更高。LPS诱导的ALI诱导后，p-p38/p38比值和血管细胞粘附分子-1和某些促炎细胞因子（巨噬细胞炎症蛋白-2、肿瘤坏死因子-α、白细胞介素-6和白细胞介素-1β）的表达增加，而LPS处理的TREM-2 KO小鼠中这些水平更高。当施用miPSCs时，这些影响会降低。因此，本研究的结果表明，miPSCs 通过降低中性粒细胞对 TREM-1 和 p38 丝裂原活化蛋白激酶信号的表达，减弱了中性粒细胞在 LPS 诱导的肺部炎症和损伤中的作用 TREM-2 KO小鼠模型表现出LPS诱导的ALI的病理严重程度更高，中性粒细胞迁移和浸润增加，中性粒细胞p-p38/p38比值更高。此外，与野生型肺组织相比，在 TREM-2 KO 肺组织中检测到的促炎细胞因子 MIP-2、TNF-α、IL-6 和 IL-1β 以及 VCAM-1 的水平显着更高。相比之下，TREM-1 KO模型表现出LPS诱导的ALI和中性粒细胞迁移的病理严重程度减弱。 7、、、、 髓样细胞-2 上表达的触发受体 （TREM-2）

shRNA 处理在转录和翻译水平上显着下调肺泡巨噬细胞上的 TREM-2 表达。然而，接受无义shRNA或空慢病毒载体的肺泡巨噬细胞对TREM-2表达没有影响。沉默 TREM-2 增强了 LPS 刺激后肺泡巨噬细胞对 TLR-4 以及 TNF-α 和 IL-10 的表达。这些结果表明，TREM-2 对减弱小鼠肺泡巨噬细胞的 LPS 诱导的炎症反应有显着影响，这可能依赖于 TLR-4。 有可能

近年来，针对急性肺损伤（ALI）的研究表明，肺泡巨噬细胞中表达的TREM2在ALI的发病机制和治疗过程中扮演着关键角色。TREM2是一种属于免疫调节类受体的膜蛋白，与炎症反应，尤其是巨噬细胞的极化密切相关。在ALI的背景下，巨噬细胞的M1型（促炎型）和M2型（抗炎型）的相互转换对于炎症反应的控制至关重要。 文献一探讨了运动对肥胖大鼠在内毒素诱导的ALI中TREM家族表达的影响，结果表明运动能逆转肥胖状态下TREM1的上调和TREM2的下调，抑制NF-κB的活化，从而提供了一种通过运动调节TREM表达以预防和治疗ALI的可能途径。在文献二中，大黄素通过特异性靶向NFATc1/Trem2轴促进了巨噬细胞M2的极化，显著减轻了LPS诱导的ALI/ARDS的病理状况，从而揭示了TREM2在调节炎症反应中的潜在机制。 葡萄籽原花青素（GSP）对于ALI的研究，即文献三，显示了GSP在减弱LPS诱导的ALI中的功效，其中通过增加TREM2表达和激活PI3K/Akt通路，促进巨噬细胞从M1到M2的极化。这为TREM2在调节ALI中巨噬细胞极化的角色提供了新证据。类似地，在文献七中指出慢病毒介导的TREM2沉默增强了LPS刺激后肺泡巨噬细胞对TLR-4及其下游促炎细胞因子的表达。这些结果一致表明，TREM2的活性对于抑制巨噬细胞的过度激活和调控炎症反应具有重要意义。然而，具体如何精确控制这种调节作用，仍需进行更深入的机制研究。 **TREM2在ALI治疗和预防中的潜在作用** TREM2的表达水平及其调节能力对于降低ALI的炎症反应和改善预后至关重要。这一点在文献中得到了一致的认可，且各项研究揭示TREM2可能作为ALI的潜在治疗靶点。 血管活性肠肽（VIP）在抗炎作用方面的研究，即文献四，发现VIP可以通过降低TREM1的表达，提高TREM2的表达，从而调节LPS诱导的ALI。由此推断，TREM1和TREM2可能在ALI的炎症过程中存在一种动态平衡，其比例失衡可能导致炎症过程恶化。同样，在文献五中，通过慢病毒介导的TREM-2基因沉默证实了TREM-2表达降低会导致小鼠内毒素诱导的ALI中炎症反应增强。这些研究揭示了TREM2的保护作用和调节炎症反应的潜力。 综上所述，TREM2在ALI中不仅作为炎症调节因子的位置受到重视，还显示出在巨噬细胞极化调节、促炎和抗炎平衡中的关键作用。未来的研究需进一步解析TREM2相关信号通路的精细调控机制，以便开发出针对性的ALI治疗方法，通过调整或干预TREM2的表达或功能来减轻炎症反应，改善ALI患者的临床治疗效果。同时，为更好地利用TREM2在预防和治疗ALI中的潜力，理解其在多种细胞类型中的表达模式及其与TREM1的相对平衡关系，是未来研究的重要方向。"},{"instruction":"文献6说明trem2与中性粒细胞关系？","output":"文献六探讨了诱导多能干细胞（iPSCs）在脂多糖（LPS）诱导的急性肺损伤（ALI）中的作用，以及其与TREM2表达之间的相互作用。在ALI模型中，中性粒细胞的迁移和活化是导致炎症和组织损伤的关键过程。该研究显示，TREM2的敲除（KO）小鼠在LPS诱导的ALI中表现出了更高的病理严重程度，肺组织中中性粒细胞浸润增加，以及中性粒细胞内磷酸化p38 MAPK（一种与炎症信号通路有关的蛋白激酶）的水平增高，相比于野生型小鼠。 这些结果表明，TREM2可能在通过减少中性粒细胞的迁移和/或活化来控制ALI过程中的炎症反应方面具有重要作用。此外，它还表明在TREM2敲除的条件下，LPS可能通过增加中性粒细胞内磷酸化p38的水平来增强其对促炎反应的促进作用。 然而，当应用iPSC治疗时，上述在TREM2敲除小鼠中观察到的LPS诱导的ALI的严重程度及中性粒细胞内炎症相关信号的增强效果被降低，说明iPSC治疗可能通过减少中性粒细胞对TREM-1和p38 MAPK信号通路的表达和激活来抑制中性粒细胞在肺炎症和损伤中的作用。 这些发现表明，TREM2可能在中性粒细胞介导的肺炎症反应中起调节作用，因此，通过维持或增强TREM2的功能，可能为控制ALI中的炎症提供了新的治疗策略。然而，具体的分子机制、TREM2与中性粒细胞之间的直接相互作用以及这种作用在不同类型的肺疾病中是否普遍存在，仍需进一步的研究来阐明。"},{"instruction":"LPS诱导ALI，中性粒细胞增多是先天还是固有免疫？","output":"脂多糖（LPS）诱导的急性肺损伤（ALI）中中性粒细胞增多是先天免疫（innate

在LPS诱导的ALI情景中，LPS作为细菌的外膜成分，它被认为是一种内毒素，能够激活宿主的先天免疫系统，促进炎症反应。LPS作为免疫系统识别的模式识别分子（PAMPs），通过与模式识别受体（PRRs）如Toll样受体4（TLR4）结合，触发一系列炎症信号通路，如核因子κB (NF-κB) 信号通路，导致促炎细胞因子和趋化因子的产生，这些因子会吸引和激活更多的免疫细胞，其中包括中性粒细胞。 中性粒细胞作为先天免疫系统中最早到达炎症现场的细胞之一，具有快速反应和移动至感染或受伤部位的功能。它们能够通过嗜中性粒细胞趋化因子（如IL-8）的引导，迁移到受损的肺组织，进行吞噬、分泌杀菌物质和释放网状结构（NETs）来消灭病原体。然而，持续的中性粒细胞激活和浸润可能导致肺组织的损伤，从而加剧ALI的严重程度。 因此，在LPS诱导的ALI中，中性粒细胞的激活和增多可以视为是先天免疫应答的一部分，其目的是为了迅速应对感染和限制病原体的扩散，但过度的免疫反应也有可能对宿主自身组织造成损伤。"},{"instruction":"PD-L1 促进哮喘气道炎症和气道高反应性(airway hyperresponsiveness, AHR) PD-L1 抑制 Th1 分泌 IFN-γ，上调 Th2 对 IL-4

此外，TREM2对T细胞的作用也不容忽视。TREM2能够调节T细胞的活化和分化，尤其是在调控T助细胞（Th）和调节性T细胞（Treg）的平衡方面显得尤为重要[39]。此类调控能够影响Th2细胞介导的促炎途径，包括IL-4、IL-5和IL-13等细胞因子的释放，这些因子是哮喘气道炎症和AHR的关键[40]。因此，TREM2在维持免疫系统的平衡以及限制Th2型炎症能力上可能具有潜在价值。 在哮喘治疗的研究中，潜在的策略包括通过提高TREM2的功能来抑制肺部的M1型巨噬细胞活动，以及调节T细胞的响应，从而减少气道炎症，降低AHR并改善哮喘症状[41]。然而，关于TREM2在哮喘调控中的具体机制及其潜在为临床治疗哮喘的应用前景，仍需更多的实验和临床研究来深入探讨。 [36] Kerschensteiner, M., Meinl, E., & Hohlfeld, R.

Gravity, indeed, pulls masses together, and one would naturally expect that the attraction between galaxies due to their mass would slow down the expansion of the universe following the Big Bang. However, observations, most notably those involving distant Type Ia supernovae in the late 1990s, have shown that the expansion is accelerating rather than slowing down. This accelerated expansion is widely attributed to a mysterious component of the universe called \\"dark energy.\\" Dark energy constitutes about 68% of the total energy content of the universe, according to the current cosmological model. While its nature remains poorly understood, dark energy is characterized by a negative pressure, driving galaxies apart and causing the expansion of space itself to accelerate. Several theories have been proposed to explain dark energy: 1. Cosmological Constant: Albert Einstein originally introduced the cosmological constant (denoted by the Greek letter Lambda, Λ) in his field equations of General Relativity to maintain a static universe. Today, the cosmological constant is repurposed to describe the energy density of empty space, or vacuum energy, which remains constant as the universe expands. 2. Quintessence: This is a hypothetical form of dark energy with a dynamic field whose energy density can change with time, unlike the fixed cosmological constant. 3. Modifications to General Relativity: Some theoretical physicists have proposed that the observed accelerated expansion could be due to modifications to General Relativity on cosmological scales, rather than an intrinsic property of space itself. It is important to note that while we can observe the effects of dark energy through its gravitational influence on the expansion rate, its fundamental nature is still one of the biggest mysteries in physics. Understanding dark energy is an active area of research, with scientists trying to reconcile its existence with our current understanding of physics and cosmology."},{"instruction":"¿Como saber si tengo anisakis?","output":"El Anisakis es un parásito que se encuentra en algunos pescados y mariscos crudos o poco cocinados. La infección causada por este parásito se conoce como anisakiasis. Los síntomas de la anisakiasis pueden aparecer entre unas pocas horas y hasta dos semanas después de haber consumido pescado contaminado. Algunos de los síntomas más comunes incluyen: 1. Náuseas y vómitos 2. Dolor abdominal, que puede ser intenso 3. Diarrea 4. Reacciones alérgicas, que pueden incluir urticaria o, en casos graves, anafilaxia 5. Malestar general 6. Fiebre (en ocasiones) Si presentas síntomas que sugieren la posibilidad de una infección por Anisakis y has consumido pescado o mariscos potencialmente contaminados, debes buscar atención médica. Los profesionales de la salud pueden realizar diferentes pruebas para diagnosticar la infección, incluyendo: - Endoscopia: Permite observar el interior del tracto gastrointestinal para detectar la presencia de larvas del parásito. - Análisis de sangre: Se buscan signos de incremento en los eosinófilos, que son un tipo de células que suelen aumentar en respuesta a infecciones parasitarias, y también se pueden hacer pruebas específicas de anticuerpos IgE contra Anisakis. - Exámenes de las heces: Pueden revelar la presencia de larvas o de ADN del parásito mediante técnicas de biología molecular. - Pruebas de alergia cutánea: Para determinar si existe una reacción alérgica al parásito. El tratamiento para la anisakiasis puede involucrar la extracción de las larvas del parásito mediante endoscopia, el uso de medicamentos para aliviar los síntomas y, en algunos casos, fármacos antiparasitarios. En situaciones de reacciones alérgicas graves, es necesario un tratamiento inmediato para la anafilaxia. Recuerda, solo un profesional de la salud puede proporcionarte un diagnóstico adecuado y recomendarte el tratamiento más apropiado. Si crees que has estado expuesto al Anisakis, contacta a tu médico."},{"instruction":"¿Pero desaparece?","output":"En la mayoría de los casos, la infección por Anisakis puede resolverse con o sin tratamiento: 1. **Auto-curación**: Algunas veces, el sistema inmunitario de la persona infectada puede superar la infección, y las larvas del parásito mueren y son expulsadas o reabsorbidas por el cuerpo. Esto puede ocurrir porque el Anisakis no puede sobrevivir en el sistema digestivo humano por mucho tiempo. 2. **Endoscopia**: Si los síntomas son severos y las larvas son accesibles, se pueden extraer mediante un procedimiento de endoscopia. 3. **Tratamiento médico**: En los casos en que se desarrollan síntomas que no se resuelven por sí solos o en el caso de reacciones alérgicas, se pueden prescribir tratamientos específicos, que pueden incluir antiparasitarios, analgésicos, o medicamentos para aliviar náuseas, vómitos y reacciones alérgicas. No obstante, incluso si los síntomas desaparecen, una persona puede desarrollar una sensibilidad alérgica al Anisakis, lo que significa que podrían experimentar reacciones alérgicas al consumir pescado o productos del mar en el futuro. Por esta razón, es importante no solo tratar los síntomas, sino también tomar precauciones al consumir pescado y productos del mar para evitar futuras infecciones. Para reducir el riesgo de anisakiasis, es recomendable: - Cocinar bien el pescado a un mínimo de 63 °C por al menos 1 minuto. - Congelar el pescado a -20 °C durante al menos 7 días si se va a consumir crudo o en preparaciones como ceviche, sushi o sashimi. - Evitar el consumo de pescado crudo o poco cocido si se tiene un historial de infección por Anisakis o se es alérgico al parásito. Si tú o alguien que conoces ha contraído anisakiasis, es vital acudir a un médico, quien podrá establecer el diagnóstico correcto y el tratamiento apropiado basado en la gravedad y los síntomas específicos."},{"instruction":"Beber mucha agua","output":"Beber mucha agua es una práctica saludable en general, ya que el agua es esencial para numerosas funciones corporales, como el transporte de nutrientes, la regulación de la temperatura corporal, la digestión y la eliminación de desechos. Sin embargo, en el contexto de una infección por Anisakis, beber agua no es un tratamiento específico que pueda eliminar el parásito o curar la anisakiasis. El agua puede ayudar a mantenerse hidratado, sobre todo si has tenido vómitos o diarrea debido a la infección, lo que es beneficioso para la recuperación general. Pero para tratar una infección por Anisakis propiamente dicha, es necesario acudir a un médico para obtener un diagnóstico adecuado y seguir el tratamiento recomendado, que podría incluir la extracción endoscópica de las larvas, el manejo de los síntomas y la prevención de reacciones alérgicas. En resumen, aunque beber suficiente agua es importante para la salud en general, no es una cura para la anisakiasis y no debe sustituir el tratamiento y las recomendaciones médicas."},{"instruction":"Какие явления называют массовидными явлениями психики? a.

You’re already naked, I’d say.“ As Ryan’s head turned with wry curiosity, Liam emptied his glass, swilling the final mouthful as amusement danced across his face. Ryan cursed under his breath, winking into the sea of bodies and forgetting Liam’s existence as he rose from his stool. “Finish my Hennessy Li’…” he trailed off as he disappeared under the dim filter of light, abandoning the counter with entrancement. “Yeah, you won’t be back,“ Liam muttered, tracing the rim of his glass in a dwindling circle. “Somebody’s all on his lonesome over here, talking to himself?” As the female voice wove through his moment of bored introspection, her eyes caught him off guard. “I was not talking to myself,“ he replied with a grin. “I was talking to you too-“ Her pale green irises held his blue gaze with a hint of unmatched mischief as she slid onto Ryan’s empty stool. “And he thinks he’s funny, huh?“. Liam’s broad grin, lopsided and drunken, propped up a dimple on his right cheek as he asked “Well he made you laugh didn’t he?“. She was already reaching out and rearranging his grime-infused hair as her laughter interspersed the closing space between them. “Maybe he did, but can he talk me out of leaving here with my friends…he has twenty seconds by the way.“ Leaning into her touch as her fingers moved to the tender spot between his earlobe and hairline, he rasped. “Oh twenty seconds is more than enough I’d say. Gimme ten My friend abandoned his drink and now, wouldn’t it be irresponsible to leave it for me to finish? “ . She laughed, eyeing the drink and weighing his proposition with a pause as her hand retreated back to the countertop, and he caught her wrist in his palm. With a gesture toward the drink , he enveloped her grasp in his own. “Or , I could leave that here and he can find his own way home tonight. All on his own without his designated driver, now that really would be wicked huh?.” Liam raised his eyebrows in mock sobriety , and she smiled , starting to stand, sliding Ryan’s drink towards him. “Well …it’s been at least twenty seconds , but will I leave?” . Her eyes challenged him with a razor sharp gleam her dark cascading over her shoulder blades as she turned to leave. “Oh, you dropped this” Liam said as her wrist slipped from his hand and he gazed at the floor, noticing a cylinder at his feet. She slid off into the crowd, leaving a bewildered Liam to retrieve the tube and rotate it between his knuckles. “Your lipstick…damn never mind.” He muttered, uncapping it in absent minded confusion, until a slip of paper fell out into his lap.","output":"The scene you've provided is engaging and effectively uses dialogue and action to create a vibrant, dynamic interaction between the characters.

Tradicionalmente, se describía utilizando el efecto magnético entre dos conductores paralelos: un amperio era la corriente que, al fluir a través de dos conductores paralelos infinitamente largos y separados por un metro en el vacío, producía una fuerza de 2 x 10^-7 newtons por metro de longitud entre esos conductores. Sin embargo, con la revisión del Sistema Internacional de Unidades adoptada en mayo de 2019, la definición del amperio fue actualizada para basarse en constantes fundamentales.

Se define al tomar el valor numérico fijo de la eficacia luminosa de la radiación monocromática de frecuencia 540 × 10^12 Hz, Kcd, de ser 683 cuando se expresa en la unidad lm⋅W^-1, la cual es igual a cd⋅sr⋅W^-1, o cd⋅sr / (kg⋅m^2⋅s^-3), donde el kilogramo, el metro y el segundo se definen en términos de h, c y ∆νCs. Esta definición asocia directamente la candela con unidades fundamentales basadas en constantes físicas: la eficacia luminosa se refiere a cómo las personas perciben la luz de diferente frecuencias, centrándose en 540 × 10^12 hercios, que corresponde a la luz de color verde; esta es una frecuencia a la que el ojo humano es bastante sensible, y la eficacia luminosa de 683 lúmenes por vatio para esta frecuencia significa que una fuente que emite un vatio de radiación monocromática a esta frecuencia y en una dirección tiene una intensidad luminosa de 683 candelas. La adopción de esta definición basada en efectos físicos fundamentales y percepciones humanas permite que la candela sea medible en términos precisos y reproducibles globalmente, vinculándola con el marco general de las unidades fundamentales que ahora dependen de constantes físicas universales."},{"instruction":"Definición de tiempo","output":"La definición moderna del tiempo, en el contexto del Sistema Internacional de Unidades (SI), se basa en la física cuántica. Desde 1967, el segundo, la unidad base del SI para el tiempo, se define a partir de propiedades fundamentales de los átomos, específicamente del átomo de cesio-133. La definición oficial del segundo es la siguiente: *El segundo se define al fijar el valor numérico de la frecuencia de transición hiperfina del estado fundamental no perturbado del átomo de cesio 133, ∆ν(Cs), en 9,192,631,770, cuando se expresa en la unidad Hz, que es igual a s^-1.* Esta definición implica que un segundo es igual a la duración de 9,192,631,770 periodos de la radiación correspondiente a la transición entre dos niveles hiperfinos del estado fundamental del átomo de cesio-133. Esta medición es extraordinariamente precisa y se basa en observaciones de un fenómeno cuántico muy consistente y reproducible, lo que permite una medición del tiempo extremadamente precisa y uniforme en todo el mundo. El uso de un fenómeno natural preciso y bien entendido, en lugar de un dispositivo mecánico o una observación astronómica, para definir el segundo ha sido un gran avance, permitiendo mejoras significativas en la medición del tiempo y sus aplicaciones, desde la sincronización de redes de telecomunicaciones hasta la navegación y la investigación científica fundamental. La definición cuántica del tiempo es un ejemplo perfecto de cómo nuestra comprensión avanzada del universo en el nivel microscópico puede ser aplicada para mejorar las medidas y estándares en nuestra vida cotidiana y tecnologías."},{"instruction":"سلام","output":"سلام! چطور می‌توانم کمکتان کنم؟"},{"instruction":"آیا لاپایی زدن درد دارد؟","output":"لاپاروسکوپی، یکی از روش‌های جراحی کم تهاجمی است که به وسیله‌ی چند برش کوچک و استفاده از یک دستگاه لوله‌ای به نام لاپاروسکوپ انجام می‌شود. این روش برای تشخیص یا درمان شرایط مختلف در شکم یا لگن استفاده می‌شود. در حین انجام لاپاروسکوپی، بیمار معمولاً تحت بیهوشی عمومی قرار می‌گیرد، بنابراین در طول عمل دردی احساس نمی‌کند. اما پس از انجام عمل، ممکن است بیمار احساس درد، ناراحتی یا کوفتگی در نواحی برش یا در شکم داشته باشد. این نوع دردها معمولا قابل کنترل با داروهای مسکن است که پزشک برای کاهش درد و افزایش راحتی بیمار تجویز می‌کند. مقدار دردی که بیمار پس از لاپاروسکوپی تجربه می‌کند، می‌تواند بسته به عوامل متعددی مانند نوع دقیق عمل انجام شده، سن بیمار، وضعیت سلامت کلی، و میزان تحمل درد بیمار متفاوت باشد. پزشکان معمولاً توصیه‌های لازم را برای مراقبت‌های پس از عمل ارائه می‌دهند تا روند بهبودی به نحو احسن صورت پذیرد."},{"instruction":"\\"Департамент транспорта представляет собой исполнительный орган правительства Сан-Андреаса основной задачей которого является планирование, строительство и обслуживание различных объектов транспортной инфраструктуры в штате, включая дороги, мосты, аэропорты, государственные железные дороги, парковки, велосипедные сооружения, портовые сооружения, терминалы для перевозки грузов, уличное освещение, дорожные знаки, светофоры, транспортные узлы, общественный транспорт и прочие объекты и услуги транспортной инфраструктуры. \\" напиши для текста продолжение, говорящей о еще одной задаче - поддержании безопасности в городе","output":"Департамент транспорта также отвечает за поддержание безопасности на дорогах и в общественном транспорте города.

Стекинг (stacking) - это метод, при котором несколько моделей обучаются независимо и их прогнозы объединяются с использованием другой модели, называемой мета-моделью. Мета-модель обучается на прогнозах базовых моделей и выполняет финальное предсказание. Таким образом, стекинг позволяет объединять множество различных моделей для получения более точных прогнозов. Бустинг (boosting) - это метод обучения ансамбля моделей, при котором каждая новая модель строится таким образом, чтобы исправлять ошибки предыдущей модели. Итеративно обучая модели, алгоритм пытается улучшить качество предсказаний, уделяя больше внимания тем образом, на которых предыдущие модели ошибались. Наиболее популярными алгоритмами бустинга являются Gradient Boosting и AdaBoost.

Бутстрэппинг позволяет создать несколько подвыборок из исходного набора данных путем выбора образцов с возвращением. Идея бэггинга заключается в том, что мы обучаем несколько моделей независимо друг от друга на разных подвыборках данных, а затем усредняем их предсказания для получения более стабильных и точных результатов. Благодаря усреднению предсказаний, уменьшается влияние случайных выбросов и помогает снизить переобучение модели. Основные шаги при использовании бэггинга: 1.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential and cumulative formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. The age regression occurs mid-casting (not after), so its effects immediately apply to my spells as I’m casting and can alter its results. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them.

By default, the \`output\` method of an FPDF object is used to either save the PDF to a file or return it as a string. However, if you want to write to a file-like object (such as a \`BytesIO\` object) instead of a file path, you can do so by capturing the output as a binary string and then writing it to the file-like object. Here's an example of how to do it: \`\`\`python from fpdf import FPDF from io import BytesIO # Create instance of FPDF class pdf = FPDF() # Add a page pdf.add_page() # Set font pdf.set_font(\\"Arial\\", size=12) # Add a cell pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=\\"Welcome to FPDF!\\", ln=True, align='C') # Create a bytes buffer (file-like object) buffer = BytesIO() # Instead of writing to a file, get the PDF as a bytestring pdf_output = pdf.output(dest='S').encode('latin1') # Write to your file-like object (buffer) buffer.write(pdf_output) # Now you can use buffer.getvalue() to access the PDF binary data # For example, to send the PDF over a web response, etc. # Don't forget to close the buffer if necessary buffer.close() \`\`\` In the example above, we're using a \`BytesIO\` instance as the target file-like object (\`buffer\`). We then use the FPDF \`output()\` method with \`dest='S'\` to get the PDF as a string in a binary format. The binary string is then written to the \`BytesIO\` object using its \`write()\` method. Remember that once you have the PDF in the \`BytesIO\` object, you can use it like any regular file object, such as passing it around in a web framework to serve it as an HTTP response, or doing in-memory manipulations without ever having to write to disk."},{"instruction":"−15= 3 1 ​ x 3 −6","output":"It seems like there might be a mistake in the formatting of your equation.

Please note that the specifics might have slightly changed due to the evolving nature of these organizations. 1. **Spring Activator (Spring):** - **Location & Focus:** Spring is a global incubator, accelerator, and advisory firm that supports impact entrepreneurs and investors. Although based in Vancouver, Canada, Spring has a broader global approach in its initiatives. - **Impact & Services:** The primary difference in impact between Spring and others is its wide scope – offering services that range from impact startup accelerators, corporate innovation, funding rounds, and educational training for entrepreneurs worldwide. Spring is well-regarded for its emphatic focus on impact entrepreneurship, aiming to empower projects that have a positive social and environmental impact globally. 2. **Global Incubators and Accelerators:** - **Location & Focus:** This category encompasses a wide range of incubators and accelerators around the world. They can vary significantly in their focus areas, including technology, healthcare, sustainability, and more. - **Impact & Services:** Global incubators and accelerators such as Y Combinator, Techstars, and others, tend to have a broader focus than just impact-driven companies. They provide mentorship, funding, and networking opportunities to startups with high-growth potential, regardless of the sector. Their impact is substantial in terms of the number of startups supported and their contribution to innovation and economic growth. However, the emphasis is more on scalable business models and less strictly on social or environmental impact compared to Spring. 3. **TieToronto:** - **Location & Focus:** TIE Toronto is part of TiE Global, a nonprofit venture devoted to entrepreneurs in all industries, at all stages, from incubation to exit. While TiE has chapters worldwide, TiE Toronto specifically serves the Toronto area, focusing on fostering entrepreneurship within the local and regional community. - **Impact & Services:** The distinguishing impact of TieToronto comes from its networking opportunities, mentorship, education, funding, and support tailored to the local ecosystem's needs. It aims to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs with a blend of global insights and local support. TieToronto, like other TiE chapters, does emphasize technology and innovation but tends to have a broader inclusivity regarding the types of businesses it supports, not exclusively focusing on impact-driven companies. In summary, the difference in impact between Spring, generic global incubators, and TiE Toronto mainly lies in their geographical focus, the sectors they cater to, and their specific engagement towards impact-driven entrepreneurship. Spring is notably distinct for its dedication to social and environmental impact, whereas generic global incubators prioritize scalability and innovation across various sectors, and TiE Toronto offers a blend of global insights with a strong emphasis on local entrepreneurship development without an exclusive focus on impact startups."},{"instruction":"TE PASARE UN LISTADO DE TITULOS PARA QUE seo optimizES con un tono llamativo, que incite al click. - LA PALABRA CLAVE SE DEBE RESPETAR YO TE PASARE EL LISTADO DEBE SER TITULOS NO MUY LARGOS, CORTOS E PRECISOS .

To achieve this in Python using pandas, you follow these steps: 1. Load your CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. 2. Use \`.replace()\` method on the \\"Label\\" column to replace -2 with 4 and -1 with 3. 3. Save the modified DataFrame back into a CSV file. Here’s the code to accomplish this: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the data df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/ML/encoded_combined_USDT_file.csv') # Replace values in the \\"Label\\" column df['Label'] = df['Label'].replace(-2, 4) df['Label'] = df['Label'].replace(-1, 3) # Save the modified DataFrame back to CSV df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/ML/encoded_combined_USDT_file.csv', index=False) \`\`\` Explanation: - The \`replace()\` function is called on the \\"Label\\" column of the DataFrame \`df\` to replace the specific values. The first argument is the value to find, and the second argument is the value to replace it with. - After replacing the values, the \`to_csv()\` method is used to save the DataFrame back into a CSV file. Setting \`index=False\` ensures that Pandas will not write row indices into the CSV file.

Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot. answer only","output":"The ladder, the wall, and the distance from the base of the building to the ladder form a right triangle. To find how far up the building the ladder reaches, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c, the ladder) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a, the distance from the base of the building, and b, the height the ladder reaches up the building). The formula is: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 We know the ladder (c) is 14 feet and the distance from the base (a) is 4 feet. We need to solve for b (the height up the building). (14 feet)^2 = (4 feet)^2 + b^2 196 = 16 + b^2 b^2 = 196 - 16 b^2 = 180 b = sqrt(180) b = 13.4 (approximately) So, the ladder reaches approximately 13.4 feet up the building to the nearest tenth of a foot."},{"instruction":"what is the lenth of the last side of this right triangle the other sides being 10 and 6 answer only","output":"The length of the last side of this right triangle with sides of 10 and 6 (assuming the 10 side is the hypotenuse) is 8.0."},{"instruction":"pasa esta informacion a formato de tabla FABRICATO S.A.

Indicadores financieros de apalancamiento 6. Crecimiento del capital en pesos: Graficar y explicar cálculo de crecimiento de capital de trabajo en pesos colombianos 7. Calcular, graficar y analizar rendimiento de la inversión ROI 8. Calcular y analizar razones financieras de mercado","output":"Para realizar un diagnóstico financiero completo de la empresa Fabricato, basándome en los datos previamente suministrados, dividiremos el análisis en las secciones indicadas. Es importante notar que algunos de los cálculos necesarios se basarán en suposiciones generales debido a la ausencia de cierta información específica. # 1. Estructurar Flujo de Caja Libre (FCF) El Flujo de Caja Libre es una medida de la capacidad de la empresa para generar efectivo después de financiar sus gastos de capital para mantener o expandir sus activos. No tenemos los gastos de capital (CapEx) directamente, pero podemos calcular el FCF usando una fórmula general: [ FCFLibre = EBIT(1 - Tasa ,de, Impuesto) + Depreciación - Cambios ,en, el, Capital ,de, Trabajo - CapEx ] Suponiendo la depreciación y EBIT dados, y sin CapEx específico, este cálculo es más un marco de referencia. # 2. Indicadores Financieros de Rentabilidad **Margen Neto** (Ganancia Neta / Ingresos Totales) y **ROE** (Ganancia Neta / Patrimonio Total) son indicadores clave de rentabilidad. Para el año 2022, usando los datos proporcionados: - Ganancia Neta: 2,236 millones de pesos. - Ingresos Totales: 461,363 millones de pesos. # 3. Indicadores Financieros de Endeudamiento La **Relación Deuda sobre Capital** se calcula como Total de Deuda / Total de Patrimonio. A partir de los datos, el total de pasivos para 2022 es 400,634 millones de pesos y el patrimonio es 448,853 millones de pesos. Esto nos da una visión de cómo la empresa se financia. # 4. Indicadores Financieros de Liquidez El **Ratio de Liquidez Corriente** se calcula como Activos Corrientes / Pasivos Corrientes. Con activos corrientes de 232,838 millones de pesos y pasivos corrientes de 186,861 millones de pesos en 2022, podemos obtener este indicador. # 5. Indicadores Financieros de Apalancamiento El **Ratio de Endeudamiento** (Total de Pasivos / Total de Activos) y el **Ratio de Cobertura de Intereses** (EBIT / Gastos de Interés) son dos medidas claves. # 6. Crecimiento del Capital en Pesos El capital de trabajo se calcula como Activos Corrientes - Pasivos Corrientes. Podemos graficar y calcular el crecimiento año con año para observar tendencias. # 7. Rendimiento de la Inversión (ROI) El ROI se calcula como Ganancia Neta / Costo de Inversión. Sin el costo específico de inversión, utilizaremos el patrimonio total como aproximación para el costo de inversión. # 8. Razones Financieras de Mercado El **Precio/Ganancia (P/E)** y la **Ratio de Precio/Valor en Libros (P/B)** son dos medidas clave. Usando el precio por acción y ganancias por acción dadas, podemos calcular el P/E. Para el P/B, necesitamos el valor en libros por acción que se calcularía a partir del Patrimonio / Número total de acciones. --- **Nota:** Estos cálculos están basados en suposiciones generales y no se han incluido cálculos específicos debido a las limitaciones en los datos específicos requeridos para cada fórmula. En la práctica, sería necesario tener todos los detalles financieros exactos, incluyendo gastos de capital (CapEx), tasa de impuesto exacta, y otros para realizar un cálculo exacto y un análisis más profundo."},{"instruction":"es la unica informacion con la que contamos, realiza los calculos necesarios e indica todo el procedimiento en cada item por favor","output":"Dado a que la información suministrada en las preguntas anteriores es limitada, realizaré un análisis financiero basado en supuestas fórmulas estándar y la información disponible. Para un análisis detallado y preciso, normalmente se necesitaría información adicional. Sin embargo, basándonos en lo que tenemos, procederemos de la siguiente manera: # 1. Estructurar Flujo de Caja Libre (FCF) La información específica sobre gastos de capital (CapEx) no fue proporcionada, por lo tanto, asumiremos que todos los ingresos y gastos proporcionados en los estados de resultados y el balance general reflejan la operación completa de la empresa, incluido cualquier CapEx. [FCF=EBIT*(1-Tasa,de,impuestos)+Depreciación-Amortización-CapEx] Sin datos sobre EBIT o depreciación y asumiendo que no hay cambios significativos de CapEx, omitiremos este cálculo. # 2. Indicadores Financieros de Rentabilidad **ROE (Rentabilidad sobre el Patrimonio)**: Se calcula dividiendo la utilidad neta entre el patrimonio. No se proporcionó una utilidad neta directa, pero se mencionó una ganancia/perdida por acción en 2022 de 402 pesos colombianos. No obstante, una figura relevante fue el \\"Resultado del período\\" para 2022, siendo 2,236 millones de pesos. El patrimonio total al final de 2022 es 448,853 millones de pesos. [ROE = frac{2,236}{448,853} = 0.00498 ] Es decir, un 0.498%, lo cual indica la rentabilidad del patrimonio de los accionistas. # 3. Indicadores Financieros de Endeudamiento **Ratio de Endeudamiento**: Se calcula dividiendo el Total de pasivos entre el total de activos para 2022: [Ratio,de,Endeudamiento= frac{400,634}{849,487} = 0.472] Ello indica que el 47,2% de los activos son financiados por deuda. # 4. Indicadores Financieros de Liquidez **Ratio de Liquidez Corriente**: [Ratio,de,Liquidez,Corriente = frac{Activos,Corrientes}{Pasivos,Corrientes} = frac{232,838}{186,861} = 1.246] Indica capacidad de la empresa para cubrir sus deudas a corto plazo con sus activos corrientes. # 5. Indicadores Financieros de Apalancamiento La información disponible no proporciona suficientes datos específicos sobre la deuda de interés para calcular, por ejemplo, el Ratio de Cobertura de Intereses. # 6. Crecimiento del Capital en Pesos Podemos calcular el crecimiento del patrimonio de 2021 a 2022: [Crecimiento,del,Patrimonio=frac{Patrimonio,2022-Patrimonio,2021}{Patrimonio,2021}] [Crecimiento = frac{448,853-461,705}{461,705} = -0.0278] Significa una disminución del 2.78%. # 7. Rendimiento de la Inversión (ROI) Consideramos el coste de la inversión como el total de activos para 2022: [ROI = frac{Ganancia}{Inversión} = frac{2,236}{849,487} = 0.00263] Indica un rendimiento de 0.263%. # 8. Razones Financieras de Mercado **Precio/Ganancia (P/E)** para 2022: [P/E = frac{Precio,por,acción}{Ganancia,por,acción} = frac{1,392}{402} = 3.463] Este cálculo proporciona una relación básica de P/E, indicando cuánto está dispuesto el mercado a pagar por cada peso de ganancia de la empresa. **Nota:** Este análisis es simplificado y basado en suposiciones y aproximaciones.

The Ruling… The judge in the district court in The Hague ruled on Wednesday that Shell must cut its net carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 against 2019 levels on an absolute basis, in line with a global push to prevent temperatures rising more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels. The judge said the company had violated a duty of care obligation regarding the human rights of those affected by climate change. What else… where else? GlaxoSmithKline is also working hard to keep the environment clean. They are committed to reducing their environmental footprint, reducing waste and emissions by 25% by 2030. This commitment means that 60% of their revenue is considered “clean.” Another bonus is their commitment to gender diversity. Their board of directors is made up of 40% of people who identify as women. The never ending arguments • Shareholder Vs Stakeholder theory. ➢Important because these philosophies guide the Actors. ➢ What happens when various actors’ objectives align? ➢ Then there is value creation for all stakeholders. • Not internalizing the cost of externality. ➢Look at this from User and Provider point of view. ➢Guided by pure conventional risk-return financing/investment decision ➢Users need to internalise the cost of externalities in order to invest in sustainable projects ➢That is an internal push from CEO who strategizes and CFO who make financing decisions. ➢If the firm does not do this or if external forces like regulators do not impose this, then the firm will have an ‘incentive’ not to internalize. ➢Forced internalization – by external forces like investors, regulations, other stakeholders. Did these actors really forget to internalise? Baker, Hollifield, and Osambela (2020) argue “ESG investment phenomenon cannot be reconciled with neoclassical investment theory, which proposes that investors care only about the risk and return attributes of an investment.” - Is this the end journey then? Emphatically No…. ➢Various evidences in literature suggest this may not be completely true. ➢Although the internalisation has accelerated only in the recent decades. ➢More so after Paris Climate conference (2015) and during the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic. Make notes (short)from above to understand it and its concepts as well","output":"**The Hague District Court Ruling on Shell:** - Shell ordered to cut carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. - The reduction is meant to align with goals preventing a temperature rise above 1.5C. - The ruling is due to a perceived violation of a duty of care to human rights affected by climate change. **GlaxoSmithKline's Environmental and Social Initiatives:** - Target to cut emissions and waste by 25% by 2030. - 60% of revenue considered environmentally friendly. - A commitment to gender diversity with 40% female representation on the board of directors. **Shareholder vs Stakeholder Theory:** - These theories influence how companies and investors operate. - Shareholder theory prioritizes shareholder profits. - Stakeholder theory considers the interests of all stakeholders, including the environment and society. - Alignment of objectives between actors can lead to value creation for everyone involved. **Internalization of Externalities:** - Cost of externalities typically not accounted for in traditional risk-return decisions. - Companies and investors need to consider the societal and environmental impacts of their actions. - This can be driven internally by leadership or externally by regulations and stakeholder pressure. - Without such internalization, companies may ignore these costs for financial gain. **ESG Investment Trends:** - Baker, Hollifield, and Osambela (2020) claim ESG investments challenge traditional neoclassical investment theory. - ESG considerations include factors beyond mere risk and return. - The importance of ESG has grown, especially post-2015 Paris Climate Agreement and during the COVID-19 pandemic. **Notes Summary:** - Shell legally mandated to significantly reduce emissions, reflecting increasing regulation to protect human rights against climate change impacts. - GSK commits to environmental sustainability and gender diversity, linked to stakeholder theory and broader corporate responsibility. - Debate between shareholder-focused profit maximization and stakeholder-focused broader value creation, with a trend towards satisfying various stakeholders. - Companies are increasingly expected to include social and environmental costs in their decisions, often driven by external pressures from investors, regulations, and stakeholders. - The traditional investment theory is challenged by the rise of ESG factors, indicating a broader concept of value that includes social and environmental considerations."},{"instruction":"r what is risk return trade off","output":"The risk-return trade-off is a fundamental concept in finance and investment that suggests there is a relationship between the risk of an investment and the potential return one can expect from it. The basic principle is that to achieve higher returns, an investor must accept a higher level of risk. Conversely, if an investor wants to take on less risk, they should expect lower returns. Here are the key points of the risk-return trade-off: 1. **Risk:** The possibility that an investment will not perform as expected, which could result in the loss of some or all the initial investment. Different investments come with different levels of risk, from low-risk government bonds to high-risk stocks or derivatives. 2. **Return:** The gain or loss on an investment over a specified period, usually expressed as a percentage of the investment's initial cost. Returns can come in the form of income (like interest or dividends) or capital gains. 3. **Trade-off:** Investors must choose between the desire for the lowest possible risk (and therefore lower potential returns), or the highest possible returns (and therefore higher potential risk). This balance can be influenced by the investor's individual risk tolerance, investment goals, time horizon, and the overall economic climate. 4. **Efficient Frontier:** This concept in modern portfolio theory represents the set of optimal investment portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. 5. **Diversification:** One method investors use to manage the risk-return trade-off is diversification. By investing in a range of different asset classes, industries, and geographic regions, an investor can potentially reduce the overall risk of their portfolio and achieve a more favorable risk-return balance. Ultimately, the risk-return trade-off dictates that there is no such thing as a high return, low-risk investment; investments that offer the promise of very high returns are usually accompanied by higher risk, and those with lower risk typically offer lower returns. Understanding this trade-off allows investors to make more informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance."},{"instruction":"Can we consider volkswagen diesel emissions scandal in greenwashing?","output":"Yes, the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, also known as \\"Dieselgate,\\" is often cited as an example of greenwashing. Greenwashing is the practice of companies disseminating disinformation to present an environmentally responsible public image while their business practices do not match those environmental claims. In the case of Volkswagen, the company marketed their diesel vehicles as being environmentally friendly and compliant with emissions standards, highlighting their efficiency and \\"clean diesel\\" technology. However, in 2015 it was revealed that Volkswagen had installed \\"defeat devices\\" in millions of diesel-engine vehicles. These devices were designed to cheat emissions tests by making the cars appear to emit fewer pollutants than they actually did during normal driving conditions. Volkswagen's promotion of their diesel vehicles as eco-friendly while knowingly employing technology to manipulate emissions testing betrayed consumer trust and violated environmental regulations. It is considered one of the most significant examples of corporate greenwashing due to the scale of deception and the gap between the company's sustainability marketing and its actual environmental impact."},{"instruction":"what are abiotic resources","output":"Abiotic resources are natural resources that are non-living. They comprise a wide range of materials and substances that come from the Earth and are utilized by humans in various ways, but do not arise from organic sources (i.e., they are not biologically produced). Examples of abiotic resources include: 1. **Minerals:** Elements or compounds that occur naturally within the Earth's crust, like iron, gold, silver, copper, salt, diamonds, and other precious or base metals and minerals. 2. **Water:** Although water supports life, it is an abiotic resource on its own. It is used for drinking, irrigation, industry, transport, and energy generation among other uses. 3. **Air:** The gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere, which are used for respiration by living organisms, but also play a crucial role in climate and weather patterns and are used in various industrial processes. 4. **Rocks and Sediments:** Materials like sand, gravel, and stone that are used in construction and manufacturing. 5. **Fossil Fuels:** Coal, natural gas, and petroleum products that are derived from the ancient remains of plants and animals but exist now as non-living deposits within the Earth and are used for energy. 6. **Soil:** While soil is a mixture that includes organic matter, it is considered an abiotic resource due to its inorganic components such as minerals and water which are essential for plant growth. 7. **Metals:** Various metals extracted from the Earth used in construction, technology, manufacturing, and many other applications. 8. **Sunlight:** A source of energy that is central to climate and weather and can be harnessed for solar power. Abiotic resources can be renewable or non-renewable. Renewable abiotic resources, such as sunlight and wind, are naturally replenished on a human time scale. Non-renewable abiotic resources, including minerals and fossil fuels, are finite because they do not replenish quickly enough to be considered sustainable for human use on a geological time scale."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Однако рассмотрим несколько типов лидерства, которые часто встречаются в учебных классах университета: 1. **Авторитарный (или директивный) лидерство** – Преподаватель устанавливает правила и ожидания без существенного внимания к мнению студентов. Этот тип лидерства может быть эффективным для краткосрочного исполнения конкретных задач, но может снижать уровень мотивации и участия студентов в долгосрочной перспективе. 2. **Демократический (или участвующий) лидерство** – Преподаватель способствует участию студентов в процессе принятия решений, обсуждает с ними планы и методы обучения. Это способствует развитию критического мышления, активизирует учебный процесс и может повысить удовлетворенность студентов курсом. 3. **Лидерство-коучинг** – Преподаватель выступает в роли наставника, акцентируя внимание на развитии и обучении студентов, их индивидуальных потребностях и целях. Этот подход помогает студентам осваивать материал глубже и развивать навыки самостоятельного обучения. 4. **Трансформационное лидерство** – Преподаватель выступает в роли вдохновителя, стремясь поднять уровень мотивации, обучения и этических стандартов через визию, энтузиазм и высокие ожидания. Подход подразумевает тесное взаимодействие и личное влияние на студентов. В реальности многие преподаватели используют комбинированные или гибридные стили, модифицируя и адаптируя свои методы в зависимости от специфики курса, личности и потребностей студентов. Эффективность лидерства в значительной степени определяется не только стилем, но и умением преподавателя адаптироваться к меняющимся условиям и ожиданиям студентов."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some suggestions: 1. **Modify the Transformer Encoder** to include layer normalization before the self-attention and point-wise feed-forward network, as well as during the residual connections. This can help stabilize the learning process. 2. **Introduce Pre-Layer Normalization** in the transformer structure, which applies normalization at the beginning of the transformer block. 3. **Positional Encoding**: Instead of adding positional encoding to the input embeddings directly, consider using a learnable positional embedding that might capture more complex dependencies based on the positions. 4. **Gating Network Improvements**: To make the gating network more effective, introduce a more complex architecture with multiple layers and a different activation function like GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) that might capture complexities better. 5. **Attention Mechanism**: Modify the multi-head attention to include a more adaptive attention mechanism like the recently proposed 'efficient attention mechanisms' that reduce the computational complexity and may enhance performance. 6. **Regularization Techniques**: Add more advanced regularization techniques such as Dropout, Layer Dropout, or even Attention Dropout to prevent the model from overfitting. Let's implement some of these modifications in your \`TransformerExpert\` and \`GatingNetwork\` classes: \`\`\`python class ModifiedTransformerExpert(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_size, d_model, output_size, nhead, dim_feedforward, num_encoder_layers=1): super(ModifiedTransformerExpert, self).__init__() self.d_model = d_model self.input_fc = nn.Linear(input_size, d_model) self.pos_encoder = nn.Parameter(positional_encoding(1, d_model, device), requires_grad=True) encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=nhead, dim_feedforward=dim_feedforward, batch_first=True, norm_first=True) self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_encoder_layers) self.output_fc = nn.Linear(d_model, output_size) self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model) def forward(self, x): x = self.norm(self.input_fc(x)) + self.pos_encoder transformer_output = self.transformer_encoder(x) output = self.output_fc(transformer_output) return output class ImprovedGatingNetwork(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_feature_dim, num_experts, hidden_dims=[512], dropout_rate=0.1): super(ImprovedGatingNetwork, self).__init__() layers = [] last_dim = input_feature_dim for hidden_dim in hidden_dims: layers.extend([ nn.Linear(last_dim, hidden_dim), nn.GELU(), nn.Dropout(dropout_rate), ]) last_dim = hidden_dim layers.append(nn.Linear(last_dim, num_experts)) self.fc_layers = nn.Sequential(*layers) self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1) def forward(self, x): x = x.mean(dim=1) # To ensure gating is based on overall features across the sequence x = self.fc_layers(x) return self.softmax(x) \`\`\` These changes introduce a more robust architecture. By allowing the positional encodings to be learnable and moving normalization to the start of transformer operations, we could potentially see better training stability and improved performance. Additionally, enhancing the gating network by employing a deeper, more nuanced architecture might lead to more effective expert selection in the \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\` model. It's crucial to monitor the training process closely and adjust hyperparameters accordingly, as these modifications introduce new dynamics to the training process."},{"instruction":"add a function to evaluate the model on its training dataset and retun model metrics and give it a score of accuracy, add another function to plot loss over batch evolution","output":"To complement your training setup, adding model evaluation and loss visualization functions can provide deeper insights into the training process and model performance.

To provide a more accurate calculation of average loss, you should divide the total loss by the total number of items (not batches) processed. This can be particularly important in datasets where the last batch might be smaller than the others if the dataset size doesn't evenly divide by the batch size.

This approach ensures the average loss reflects the loss per item rather than per batch, providing a more accurate portrayal of the model's performance across the entire dataset. - **Loss History:** The function now returns \`loss_history\` so it can be passed directly to the \`plot_loss()\` function you introduce later for visualization. This way, you maintain a clear record of how the model's loss evolves throughout training. Ensure your data loading and batch handling align with these calculations.

This adjustment aligns variable scope in Python with the flow of your code, allowing data produced inside a function (the loss history, in this case) to be utilized outside the function. This pattern—calling a function that returns data, capturing that return value, and using it for further processing—is common in Python and many other languages.

This is a common issue when evaluating models, especially in the context of classification tasks, and could arise due to several reasons: 1. **Incorrect Aggregation of Predictions**: If the output of your model includes sequence outputs (for example, in a sequence-to-sequence task) or is being evaluated on batches, ensure predictions are properly collected and flattened (when needed) before comparison with the flattened target values. 2. **Data Collation**: Ensure that both your predictions and targets are being correctly accumulated over the entire dataset. This includes ensuring they are both flattened if your dataset consists of batches of sequences. The provided \`evaluate_model\` function seems to assume a flat list of predictions and targets, but it does not account for the potential structure of your model's outputs or the batching of inputs and targets. # Debugging the Issue - **Ensure Target Flattening Matches Prediction Processing**: First, confirm that your model's predictions (\`all_preds\`) are being generated and collected in a manner consistent with the shape/structure of your dataset targets (\`all_targets\`). - **Model Output Check**: Verify if your model could be returning a different shape or sequence of outputs than expected. For instance, if the model outputs sequences where you expected singular predictions per input. # Adjusting the \`evaluate_model\` Function Given the context, you might need to adjust how the outputs are handled: 1. **Flatten Model Outputs Properly**: If your model produces outputs in a sequence or any non-flat structure per input, make sure to flatten these outputs correctly before appending them to \`all_preds\`. 2. **Batch Handling**: Ensure that when predictions are generated, they are matched correctly with the targets. This could involve broadcasting or reshaping operations, particularly if dealing with multi-dimensional outputs or targets. # A Potential Fix Below is a simplified adjustment you might consider, ensuring it matches the nature of your specific task: \`\`\`python def evaluate_model(model, data_loader, device): model.eval() all_preds, all_targets = [], [] with torch.no_grad(): for inputs, targets in data_loader: inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device) outputs = model(inputs) # Assuming the model output is directly class indices. Adjust as necessary. predictions = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=-1).view(-1) # Flatten predicted indices all_preds.extend(predictions.cpu().numpy()) all_targets.extend(targets.view(-1).cpu().numpy()) # Ensure targets are also flattened # Calculate accuracy after ensuring all_preds and all_targets are correctly aligned. accuracy = accuracy_score(all_targets, all_preds) print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}') return accuracy \`\`\` The key adjustments include ensuring both \`predictions\` and \`targets\` are flattened appropriately by using \`view(-1)\`, making them suitable for direct comparison regardless of batch size. Remember, this approach assumes 1) Your data loader properly batches your dataset, and 2) Your model outputs are structured such that \`torch.argmax(...)\` is the correct way to derive class predictions.

The drainage area of the river at the location where the farmer wants to withdraw water is 13 km2 and is characterized by primarily agricultural land use. The river is not gauged. Soils in the watershed are primarily sandy loam and slopes range between 1 to 10%. You can assume the watershed is located close to Steam Mill Village for selecting climate data. The farmer is planning to submit an application to Nova Scotia Environment and Climate Change to withdrawal water directly from the river during the time period July 1 – August 30 to irrigate a vegetable crop. They plan to irrigate 25 ha of cropland. Some assumptions you can make in conducting your assessment: • Water needs can be estimated as the amount of potential evapotranspiration (PET) expected to occur during the months of July and August. The Penman Monteith Equation, using the FAO methodology, should be used to estimate PET. Monthly average PET rates can be used to estimate water needs during each month. • The farmer would operate the irrigation system for a maximum of 40 hr/week (i.e. they would only pump water from the river for a maximum of 40 hr/week)","output":"To approach this assignment using Microsoft Excel and Minitab, you'll undertake several steps to evaluate the feasibility of using the river for irrigation based on the available data and assumptions provided. Here's how you can structure your analysis: # Step 1: Collect Climate and River Data 1. **Climate Data**: You need to find or estimate climate data for Steam Mill Village. This should include temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed data for July and August, which are critical for the Penman Monteith Equation. 2. **River Characteristics and Assumptions**: Noted characteristics such as the drainage area (13 km2), land use (agricultural), and soil type (sandy loam) will help in estimating runoff and water availability but may not be directly used in the calculations unless you're also calculating runoff coefficients or similar estimates. # Step 2: Setup Microsoft Excel for PET Calculation 1. **Input Data**: In Excel, arrange your climate data inputs for each month. Make sure to include all variables needed for the Penman Monteith Equation, which are solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. 2. **Penman Monteith Equation**: Implement the Penman Monteith Equation to calculate the PET for each month (July and August). Excel is ideal for these calculations because you can organize your data, apply the equation, and easily adjust values if needed. The FAO provides a detailed guide on how to use this equation. # Step 3: Estimating Water Needs 1. **Calculate Monthly Water Needs**: Using the PET values from the previous step, estimate the total water needs for the 25 ha of cropland during July and August. Remember, the water needs can be estimated as the amount of PET. 2. **Estimate Total Volume**: Calculate the total volume of water needed for the entire irrigation period (sum of July and August). This will give you the volume of water the farmer plans to use. # Step 4: Evaluating Water Withdrawal Feasibility 1. **Calculate Weekly Water Needs**: Considering the maximum operation time of the irrigation system (40 hr/week), calculate how much water can potentially be withdrawn each week. 2. **Consider River Flow**: Although the river is not gauged and you lack direct flow measurements, you may need to infer or estimate based on regional data, similar watersheds, or literature values what a sustainable withdrawal rate might be to ensure it meets or exceeds the weekly withdrawal needs. # Step 5: Analysis and Presentation 1. **Summary**: Use Excel to create tables that summarize your findings including estimated PET, total irrigation needs, and weekly withdrawal rates. 2. **Insights and Conclusion**: Summarize whether the river can sustainably meet the irrigation demands based on your analysis. Consider variables like potential for reduced flow during summer, impact of withdrawals on river health, etc. # Step 6: Statistical Analysis with Minitab While most of the calculations can be performed in Excel, Minitab could be used for more advanced statistical analysis, such as predicting uncertainties in your estimates. For instance, if you have historical climate data, you could use Minitab to run regression analysis to see how climate variables affect PET over time, though this might be beyond the scope of your immediate needs. Remember, throughout your analysis, document your assumptions and approaches clearly, as these are critical for understanding the feasibility of the water withdrawal and its potential impact on both the agricultural output and the environmental sustainability of the river ecosystem."},{"instruction":"more detail please","output":"To provide a more detailed approach, let’s break down the process into comprehensive steps. This detailed guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Microsoft Excel, Minitab, and the Penman-Monteith equation. We'll be focusing more on the Excel part, as Minitab's statistical analysis might be ancillary for this specific assignment. # Detailed Approach in Excel: Step 1: Setting Up Excel for Climate Data and Penman-Monteith Calculations 1. **Collecting Climate Data:** First, gather the necessary climate data for Steam Mill Village for July and August. You need average daily temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed at 2 meters, and solar radiation. Sources might include local meteorological stations, online databases, or published climatic research. 2. **Excel Sheet Preparation:** - Allocate a worksheet for inputting your climate data. - Label columns for the date, average daily temperatures, relative humidity, daily solar radiation, and wind speed. - Input or import the collected data into the respective columns. 3. **Implementing the Penman-Monteith Equation:** - In a new column, implement the Penman-Monteith equation to calculate daily PET values using the climate data. This involves translating the equation into Excel formulae, which can handle individual components like net radiation at the crop surface, soil heat flux density, and the vapor pressure deficit. - Sum the daily PET values to get monthly totals for July and August. Step 2: Calculating Water Needs for Irrigation 1. **Monthly Water Needs:** - For each crop type, calculate the total water needs based on the PET values. This involves multiplying the PET (in mm/day) by the area to be irrigated (25 ha) to get volumes in cubic meters (since 1 mm of water over 1 ha is equivalent to 10 m³). - Sum your daily needs to get the total for each month. 2. **Total Irrigation Volume:** - Add up the volumes for July and August to determine the total volume of water required for the entire period. Step 3: Estimating Irrigation System Capacity and Withdrawal Feasibility 1. **Weekly Operation Hours:** - Calculate how many cubic meters per hour the irrigation system must deliver to meet the crop water needs within the 40-hour weekly operation limit. This is the total monthly water need divided by the total operation hours in the month. 2. **Assess Withdrawal Feasibility:** - Without direct river flow measurements, consider looking for similar rivers in literature or consulting with local experts to estimate flow rates during your irrigation period. You need to assess if the river can sustain the weekly withdrawal demands (accounting for natural variability, such as lower flows in late summer). Step 4: Data Presentation and Reporting 1. **Data Summary:** - Create table summaries and charts in Excel showing the calculated PET values, monthly water needs, and irrigation capacity versus estimated river flow rates. 2. **Analysis and Insights:** - Draft a section discussing the feasibility of using the river as an irrigation source. Include considerations for environmental sustainability, potential impacts on the river ecosystem, and whether the irrigation demands can be sustainably met during the critical period. Additional Analysis with Minitab While your primary analysis can be conducted in Excel, Minitab can be useful for: - **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct regression analysis on historical climate data to predict future PET values and understand the variability in your calculations. - **Data Visualization:** Create advanced plots and graphs to illustrate trends in climate data, PET calculations, or to simulate different scenarios of water withdrawal and their potential impacts. Conclusion Although the detailed steps mentioned focus predominantly on leveraging Excel for the bulk of the calculations, integrating tools like Minitab for advanced statistical analysis can greatly enhance the robustness of your study. It's essential to ensure your approach remains adaptable to changing data and to maintain a critical perspective on the assumptions underlying your calculations."},{"instruction":"“Обыкновенное утро Алины не предвещало ничего нового. -Школа,Дом,Художка.

Тем не менее, существует ряд общих норм и правил, которые часто встречаются в учебных классах в университетах по всему миру. Вот некоторые из них: 1. **Пунктуальность**: Студенты и преподаватели стремятся приходить на занятия вовремя. Опоздание может считаться неуважением к преподавателю и остальным студентам. 2. **Вежливое поведение**: Ожидается, что студенты будут вежливыми в отношении преподавателя и других студентов, не перебивая и не вступая в споры агрессивным образом. 3. **Активное участие в занятиях**: Студенты поощряются задавать вопросы, участвовать в дискуссиях и групповых проектах, демонстрируя тем самым свою заинтересованность в предмете. 4. **Отсутствие электронных устройств, если они не используются в учебных целях**: Во многих классах запрещено пользоваться смартфонами или другими устройствами, если только они не необходимы для выполнения учебного задания. 5. **Соблюдение академической честности**: Плагиат, списывание и другие формы академического обмана строго запрещены и могут привести к серьезным дисциплинарным мерам. 6. **Поддержание порядка и чистоты**: Студентам ожидается, что они будут поддерживать порядок в аудитории, убирая за собой мусор и возвращая мебель на место, если она была перемещена во время занятия. 7. **Уважение частной жизни и конфиденциальности**: Не распространять личную информацию о других студентах или преподавателях без их разрешения. 8. **Соблюдение правил по безопасности**: В некоторых лабораториях или на практических занятиях существуют специфические требования по безопасности, которые необходимо соблюдать. Эти нормы и правила призваны создать благоприятную учебную среду, способствовать продуктивному обучению и взаимоуважению между участниками учебного процесса. Важно помнить, что конкретные правила могут отличаться в различных учебных заведениях, поэтому всегда полезно ознакомиться с учебным регламентом своего университета."},{"instruction":"Some people often share their updates on social media platform. They often use WeChat to share funny thing making them feel happy to their friends. other people often share their experience about how they manage to overcome difficulties in their work and study on Youtube, which allows others to be able to learn some skill from these experiences.","output":"Indeed, sharing updates on social media platforms is a prevalent and influential aspect of our daily lives, serving multiple purposes for both the sharer and the audience. Platforms like WeChat and YouTube have become invaluable tools for this kind of sharing, each catering to different types of content and audiences. Here's a closer look at how these platforms are used for sharing updates and experiences: # WeChat for Sharing Light-hearted Moments WeChat is a versatile app that is widely used in China and among Chinese communities worldwide. It's not just a messaging app; it's a social media platform, a payment system, and much more, all rolled into one. When it comes to sharing updates: - **Moments Feature:** WeChat users often use the \\"Moments\\" feature to share updates with their friends. This can include photos, videos, and text updates. Since these are shared within a user's circle of friends, the content tends to be more personal and can include daily life updates, funny incidents, or moments of happiness. - **Privacy Settings:** The privacy settings in WeChat allow users to carefully control who sees their updates, making it a more intimate platform for sharing personal anecdotes or joyous moments. - **Engagement:** Friends can like or comment on these updates, fostering a sense of community and shared happiness. # YouTube for Sharing Experiences and Skills On the other hand, YouTube serves a different purpose. It is a global video-sharing platform where users from all around the world can upload, view, and share video clips. This platform is especially popular for learning and sharing experiences: - **Educational Content:** Many people use YouTube to share their knowledge, skills, and experiences. This can range from academic subjects to practical life skills, DIY projects, work experiences, and how-to guides. - **Overcoming Challenges:** It's not uncommon to find motivational content on YouTube where individuals share how they've overcome difficulties in work, study, or personal life. These stories can motivate and inspire viewers to face their own challenges. - **Community and Support:** YouTube's comment section and community tab provide a space for interaction between the content creator and the viewers. People can ask questions, provide feedback, or share their own experiences, creating a supportive community tied by common interests or challenges. # The Impact of Sharing Both platforms, despite their different formats and uses, facilitate meaningful exchanges. Sharing funny or happy moments on WeChat can brighten someone's day, while sharing experiences and skills on YouTube can educate, motivate, and inspire others. This aspect of social media helps to foster a sense of connection and community, even across great distances. - **Learning from Others:** Content shared about overcoming difficulties or learning new skills can be incredibly valuable, providing viewers with practical advice and emotional support. - **Sharing Joy:** Sharing moments of joy and humor can create a positive ripple effect, spreading happiness and laughter among friends and communities. In summary, platforms like WeChat and YouTube offer powerful mediums for sharing different aspects of our lives. Whether it's a brief moment of joy, a major life challenge, or a valuable lesson learned, these platforms enable us to connect with others in meaningful ways."},{"instruction":"翻译成英文：你对我英语进步的贡献很大","output":"You have made a significant contribution to my progress in English."},{"instruction":"Напиши текст для песни, начинающийся со слов: уходи, уходи","output":"Уходи, уходи, ты больше не мой, В сердце оставил ты лишь пустоту собой.

Для более эффективного использования отпускных дней, рекомендую: 1. Сочетать отпуск с длинными праздничными выходными, такими как Новогодние праздники, майские праздники (1 и 9 Мая), День России (12 Июня) и День Народного Единства (4 Ноября). 2. Рассмотреть возможность взять отпуск вокруг таких периодов, чтобы максимизировать количество подряд идущих выходных дней, используя как можно меньше дней отпуска. 3. Учитывать местные праздники, если в вашем регионе они отмечаются и предоставляют дополнительные выходные. По производственному календарю на 2023 год, вы можете взять отпуск следующим образом (предполагая, что переносы рабочих дней и строение календаря аналогичны прошлым годам): - Взять отпуск в конце апреля — начале мая, чтобы попасть на майские праздники. - Взять отпуск в середине июня, чтобы совместить с Днём России, если праздник сочетается с выходными, образуя «длинные выходные». - Взять отпуск в начале ноября, чтобы использовать День Народного Единства как дополнительный выходной. Рекомендуется заранее подготовиться и ознакомиться с производственным календарём на текущий год, когда он будет утверждён и опубликован, для более точного планирования отпускных периодов."},{"instruction":"tengo una página web en wordpress, me gustaría saber como introducir las estadisticas de youtube, tiktok, facebook, instagram, twiter en una pagina de wordpress para que los usuarios vean las estadisticas","output":"Introducir las estadísticas de plataformas sociales como YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram y Twitter en tu página de WordPress puede ser una excelente manera de mostrar el alcance de tu presencia en línea y fomentar la participación de tu audiencia. Aquí te dejo varios métodos para hacerlo: # 1. Plugins específicos de WordPress La forma más sencilla de incorporar estas estadísticas en tu sitio es mediante el uso de plugins. Algunos plugins están diseñados específicamente para esta finalidad y pueden mostrar estadísticas de diversas redes sociales. Busca en el repositorio de plugins de WordPress términos como “social media stats”, “social counter”, o nombres específicos de las plataformas de interés. **Ejemplo de plugins:** - **Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons**: Permite mostrar botones para compartir en redes sociales y también puede incluir el número de seguidores/comparticiones como una estadística. - **AccessPress Social Counter**: Un plugin gratuito que muestra el número de seguidores/subscriptores de tus perfiles en redes sociales. # 2. Widgets y API Las principales plataformas sociales ofrecen widgets y APIs que te permiten incrustar contenido específico, incluyendo estadísticas, en tu sitio web. - **YouTube**: Puedes utilizar la API de YouTube para recoger datos sobre tu canal, como el número de suscriptores y vistas, y mostrarlos en tu sitio mediante código personalizado o plugins que integren la API de YouTube. - **Facebook e Instagram**: Para ambas plataformas, propiedad de Meta, necesitarás utilizar la Graph API para acceder a estadísticas. Exigen autenticación y cierto nivel de permisos, lo que puede requerir una revisión por parte de Facebook. - **TikTok**: A través de la TikTok For Developers puedes acceder a algunos widgets que pueden ser incrustados directamente en tu web, aunque las estadísticas detalladas pueden requerir el acceso a la API de TikTok, que tiene limitaciones. - **Twitter**: Ofrece widgets fácilmente personalizables para incrustar en tu sitio, incluyendo feeds que muestran tus últimos tweets que indirectamente pueden reflejar tu actividad en la plataforma. # 3. Incrustaciones Manuales (Embeds) Para contenidos específicos como videos (YouTube) o publicaciones (Instagram, Twitter), puedes utilizar la opción de incrustación (Embed) que ofrecen estas plataformas. Se generará un código IFRAME que puedes colocar directamente en el editor de WordPress, en el lugar donde desees que aparezca la información. # 4. Desarrollo personalizado Si tienes conocimientos de programación o puedes contratar a un desarrollador, personalizar las llamadas a la API de cada plataforma y diseñar un display a medida puede ser la mejor opción para mostrar las estadísticas de una manera única y que se integre perfectamente con el diseño de tu sitio. **Nota importante**: Cada vez que uses datos de terceros, debes tener en cuenta las políticas de privacidad y los términos de servicio de cada plataforma, especialmente en lo que respecta a la manipulación y visualización de datos de usuarios. # 5. Actualización manual Si prefieres una solución más simple y tus estadísticas no necesitan actualizarse en tiempo real, puedes optar por actualizar estos datos manualmente en tu sitio. Aunque esta opción puede ser viable para sitios más pequeños o con una audiencia más limitada, se vuelve poco práctica a medida que tu presencia en redes sociales crece. Implementar cualquiera de estos métodos te ayudará a mostrar las estadísticas sociales en tu sitio web de WordPress, solo deberás elegir el que mejor se adapte a tus necesidades y habilidades técnicas."},{"instruction":"donde conseguir las apis","output":"Para conseguir las APIs y utilizarlas en tu proyecto de WordPress, tendrás que visitar los sitios oficiales de desarrolladores de cada plataforma social que te interese.

Aquí te presentaré algunos métodos que van desde el uso de plugins hasta la incorporación de APIs a través de código personalizado. # 1. Uso de Plugins Para usuarios con menor experiencia técnica, utilizar plugins que ya integren estas funcionalidades es la opción más sencilla: 1. **Buscar el Plugin Adecuado**: Ir al área de administración de WordPress, navegar a \\"Plugins\\" → \\"Añadir nuevo\\" y buscar plugins como \\"Social Media Feeds\\", \\"Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed\\" (para Instagram), o \\"Custom Twitter Feeds\\" (para Twitter). También hay plugins para contar seguidores o mostrar estadísticas de redes sociales, como \\"Social Count Plus\\". 2. **Instalar el Plugin**: Una vez encuentres el plugin que se adapte a tus necesidades, haz clic en \\"Instalar ahora\\" y luego en \\"Activar\\". 3. **Configurar el Plugin**: Generalmente, deberás ir a la configuración del plugin (cada uno tendrá su propia ubicación en el menú de administración de WordPress) y seguir los pasos específicos. Esto puede incluir autorizar el acceso a tus cuentas de redes sociales e ingresar claves API. 4. **Incorporar al Sitio**: Muchos plugins ofrecen shortcodes o widgets que puedes agregar directamente en tus páginas, entradas, o áreas de widgets. # 2. Implementación a través de Widgets de Redes Sociales Varias plataformas ofrecen la posibilidad de generar directamente desde sus sitios widgets personalizables que puedes copiar y pegar en tu sitio: 1. **Generar el Código del Widget**: Ve al sitio de la red social, busca la sección para desarrolladores o la opción para generar widgets y sigue los pasos para personalizar tu widget. 2. **Añadir el Código a WordPress**: Puedes añadir el código HTML directamente en cualquier página o entrada utilizando el editor de WordPress.

Озон является мощным окислителем, и при контакте с органическими веществами может вызвать различные химические реакции, включая разложение некоторых компонентов, образование новых соединений или даже полное окисление органических молекул до углекислого газа и воды. В случае зернового дистиллята из солода (который является основой для многих видов виски), окисление озоном может привести к изменениям в составе и вкусе дистиллята. Озон может взаимодействовать с алкогольными соединениями, эфирами, фенолами и другими веществами в дистилляте, изменяя их химическую структуру и, следовательно, вкусовые качества. Например, озон может реагировать с нежелательными серными соединениями и продуктами окисления, которые могут формироваться в процессе дистилляции или хранения, и удалять их, улучшая тем самым вкус напитка. Однако процесс должен быть строго контролируемым, так как чрезмерное окисление может привести к потере положительных ароматических и вкусовых качеств дистиллята и сделать его непригодным для употребления. Поэтому, если подобный эксперимент проводится, его нужно осуществлять с большой осторожностью и под наблюдением специалистов в условиях лаборатории или на специализированном оборудовании. В промышленности озон часто используется для очистки воды, сточных вод и воздуха, но применение его в производстве алкогольных напитков не является распространенной практикой и требует дополнительных исследований."},{"instruction":"какие вредные вещества образуются в среднестатистическом зерновом дистилляте","output":"В процессе производства зерновых дистиллятов, таких как виски, водка и другие спиртные напитки, могут образовываться некоторые вредные вещества. Вот несколько примеров: 1. Метанол (метиловый спирт) – опасный токсин, который может образовываться в малых количествах в результате ферментации. Метанол в больших дозах токсичен и может вызвать повреждение зрительного нерва и другие серьёзные заболевания. Однако в коммерческих дистиллятах содержание метанола строго контролируется и не должно превышать установленные безопасные пределы. 2. Ацетальдегид – промежуточный продукт метаболизма этанола, который также может образовываться во время ферментации. Ацетальдегид является потенциально токсичным и может вызвать головные боли, усталость и другие симптомы \\"похмелья\\". В малых количествах он придает напиткам определённые ароматические нюансы, но его уровень также тщательно контролируется производителями. 3. Высшие спирты (фузельные масла) – это смесь различных алкогольных соединений, которые образуются во время ферментации вместе с этанолом. К ним относятся изоамиловый, изобутиловый, пропиловый и бутиловый спирты. В малых концентрациях фузельные масла могут способствовать сложности и полноте вкуса, но в больших количествах они могут быть вредны и способствовать появлению неприятных ощущений при употреблении напитков и усиленным симптомам \\"похмелья\\". 4. Сернистые соединения – в редких случаях в процессе ферментации могут образовываться различные сернистые соединения, которые могут отрицательно влиять на вкус и запах дистиллята. Обычно они удаляются в процессе очистки и созревания. 5. Эфиры и альдегиды – это вещества, которые также могут образовываться в процессе ферментации и созревания дистиллята. В малых дозах они могут улучшать ароматы напитка, но в больших – быть вредными. Производители алкоголя используют различные методы контроля и очистки для минимизации содержания вредных веществ и обеспечения безопасности и качества своей продукции. Это включает в себя тщательное регулирование процесса ферментации, а также использование методов очистки и выдержки, включая дистилляцию, фильтрацию и созревание в бочках, которые помогают удалить многие из этих нежелательных компонентов."},{"instruction":"Generate a random social media or e-commerce platform (tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter(X), shopify, stan store, etsy, ebay, amazon, tiktok shop, Instagram shop, pintrest, google ads, etsy ads, instagram ads, pinterest ads, google shop, etc), , just the name, one line, add \\"digital marketing\\" following the name, no other words, no steps, no bullet points, not bolded text.

Mornings seem forced to me. So much sadness rises up, I can't bear it. I hate it, I really do. I'm an awful sight in the morning. My legs feel so exhausted that, already, I don't want to do a thing. I wonder if it's because I don't sleep well. It's a lie when they say you feel healthy in the morning. Mornings are gray. Always the same. Absolutely empty. Lying in bed each morning, I'm always so pessimistic. It's awful, really. All kinds of terrible regrets converge at once in my mind, and my heart stops up as I writhe in agony. Mornings are torture. \\"Father,\\" I tried calling out softly. Feeling strangely embarrassed and happy, I got up and hastily folded up my bedding. As I hoisted it, I was startled to hear myself exclaim, Alley-oop! I have never thought that I was the kind of girl who would utter such an unrefined expression as \\"Alleyoop.\\" It seems like the kind of thing an old lady would shout—\\"Alley-oop!\\" It's disgusting. Why would I have said such a thing? It's as if there were an old lady somewhere inside of me, and it makes me sick. I'll have to be careful from now on. I became deeply depressed then, like the time I was repelled by a stranger's uncouth gait only to realize I was walking in exactly the same manner. I never have any confidence in the mornings. I sat in front of the dressing mirror in my nightclothes. Peering at myself in the mirror without glasses or contacts, my face looked sort of blurry and moist. Glasses were the thing I hated most about my face, but there are certain good things about glasses that other people might not understand. I liked to take my glasses off and look out into the distance. Everything goes hazy, as in a dream, or like a zoetrope—it's wonderful. I can't see anything that's dirty. Only big things—vivid intense colors and light are all that enters my vision. I also liked to take my glasses off and look at people. You can’t do the same with contacts. The faces around me, all of them, seem kind and pretty and smiling. What's more, when glasses are off, you don't ever think about arguing with anyone at all, nor do I feel the need to make snide remarks. All I do is just blankly stare in silence. During those moments, thinking that I must look like a nice young miss to everyone else, I don't worry about the gawking, I just want to bask in their attention, and I feel really and truly mellow. But actually glasses are the worst. Any sense of your face disappears when you put them on. Glasses obstruct whatever emotions that might appear on your face—passion, grace, fury, weakness, innocence, sorrow. And it's curious how it becomes impossible to try to communicate with your eyes. Glasses are like a ghost. The reason I hate glasses so much is because I think the beauty of your eyes is the best thing about people. Even if they can't see your nose or if your mouth is hidden, I think that all you need are eyes—the kind of eyes that will inspire others, when they are looking into them, to live more beautifully. My eyes are just big saucers, nothing more to them. When I look closely at them in the mirror, it's disappointing. Even my mother says I have unremarkable eyes. You might say that there is no light in them. They're like lumps of charcoal—it's that unfortunate. See what I mean? It's dreadful. When I see them in the mirror—every time—I think to myself, I wish I had nice eyes that sparkled softly. Eyes like a deep blue lake, or eyes that look as if they reflect the big sky that you might look up at while lying in a lush green meadow, with clouds floating by every so often. You might even see the shadow of birds in them. I hope I meet lots of people with lovely eyes. Today the weather is nice, I reminded myself, and my mood seemed to lighten a bit. In fact, I felt happy. As I went out to the balcony I noticed strawberry flowers. The reality of Sabine’s death felt strange to me. A close friend of mine. That she had died—passed away—seemed impossible to understand. I couldn't wrap my head around it. I missed my family, or people I used to be friends with, or people I hadn't seen in a long time. I cannot stand mornings because it seems I am always bleakly reminded of long-gone times, and people I used to know, and their presences feel eerily close, like the scent of pickled radish that you just can't get rid of. Sitting down on the balcony, I gazed at the eye-drenching green of the leaves and had a pathetic urge to sit directly on the ground. I felt like trying to cry. I held my breath for a good while, in order to make my eyes bloodshot, and I thought I might be able to squeeze out a tear, but it was no good. Maybe I've turned into an impassive girl. I gave up and started cleaning the apartment. While I cleaned, I happened to be humming a song from the movie, \\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\\". I felt like I ought to look around. How amusing that I, who normally was wild about Eastern songs, would unconsciously break out into a song from \\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\\" If I go on humming songs as I'm cleaning, there'll be no hope left for me. At this rate, I fear what crude things I might utter in my sleep. Still, there was something odd about it, and I rested the broom in my hand. I changed into the underclothes I had finished sewing yesterday. I had embroidered little white roses on the bodice. You couldn't see this embroidery when I put on the rest of my clothes. No one knew it was there. How brilliant. My brother, who was very busy with work, had gone out early this morning. Ever since I was little, my brother had devoted himself to other people, so I was used to it by now, but it really was amazing how he was constantly in motion. He impressed me. While the miso soup was warming up, I sat in the doorway of the kitchen and stared idly at the copse of trees out front. At that moment, I had the odd sensation that I had been staring like this for a very long time, and would be staring from now on, just like this, sitting here in the doorway to the kitchen, in the same pose, thinking the same thing, looking at the trees out front. It felt as if the past, the present, and the future had collapsed into one single instant. Such things happen to me from time to time. I'd be sitting there, talking to someone. My gaze would wander to a corner of the table and affix itself there, unmoving. Only my mouth would move. At times like these, a strange hallucination always occurs. I would feel absolutely certain that, at some point before, under these very conditions, I've had the same conversation while, in fact, staring at the corner of the table and that what was happening now would continue to go on indefinitely, in exactly the same manner. Whenever I walk along a path, no matter how remote it is, I always feel that I have undoubtedly been on the same path before. Whenever I walk along and pluck soybean leaves at the path's edge, I always think that I have surely been on this same path and plucked these leaves before. And I believe that, from then on, over and over again, I will walk along this path, and pull soybean leaves from the exact same spots. Again, these kinds of things happen to me. Sometimes, I'd be soaking in the bath and suddenly glimpse my hand. Then, I would become convinced that however many years from now, while soaking in the bath, I will be transported to this moment when a random glance at my hand turned into a stare, and I will remember how it made me feel. These thoughts always make me rather gloomy. And once when I was putting rice into a serving bowl, I was struck by—well, it would be an exaggeration to call it inspiration but I felt something charging within my body—zipping through me like, how shall I say, I would almost call it a philosophical glimpse—and I gave myself over to it, then my head and my chest became transparent all the way through as a sense of my own existence floated down and settled over me and, silently, without making a sound, as pliant as tokoroten before you make them into noodles, I felt at the mercy of these waves, a light and beautiful feeling that I would be able to live on this way. Now, this wasn't a philosophical commotion. But it was frightening, rather, this premonition of living like a kleptomaniac cat, stealthily and quietly, and couldn't lead to any good. To go on like that for any length of time, it seems, you would end up like you're possessed. Like Jesus Christ. But the idea of a female Jesus Christ seems appalling. Ultimately though—since I'm just idle most of the time, and I really don't have any troubles to worry about—I wonder if I am just desensitized to the hundreds if not thousands of things I see and hear everyday, and in my bewilderment, those things end up assailing me like floating ghosts, one after another. I sat down to eat breakfast by myself in the dining room. I had cucumbers for the first time this year. Summer seems to come from cucumber's greenness. The green of a cucumber has a sadness like an empty heart, an aching, ticklish sadness. When I'm eating alone in the dining room, I get this wild urge to travel. I want to get on a train. I opened the newspaper. There was a photo of that actor Leonardo DiCaprio. I wondered if he was a good guy. I decided I didn't like his face. Something about his forehead. My favorite things in the newspaper are the advertisements for books. It must cost a few cents for each letter on each line, so whoever writes them are all trying their best. Each character, each phrase must generate the most possible impact, so these wonderfully wrought sentences groan with pain. Such expensive words must be pretty rare in the world. There's something I like about this. It's thrilling. I finished eating, locked up the apartment, and headed for school. All right, there's no rain, I thought to myself, but anyway I wanted to walk along with the nice umbrella that my neighbor gave to me yesterday. She used that parasol long ago, when she first got married. I felt quite proud of finding that interesting umbrella. When I carried that one, it made me feel like strolling through the streets of Paris. I thought that a dreamy antique parasol like that would go into style when a war ends. It would look great with a bonnet-style hat. Wearing a long pink-hemmed dress with a wide open collar, with black lace gloves and a beautiful violet tucked into that large, wide-brimmed hat. And when everything was lush and green I'd go to lunch in a Parisian restaurant. Resting my cheek lightly in my hand, I'd wistfully gaze at the passersby outside and then, someone would gently tap me on the shoulder. Suddenly there would be music, the rose waltz. Oh, how amusing. In reality, it was just an odd, tattered umbrella with a spindly handle. I really am miserable and pathetic. Like the little match girl. I decided to just do a little weeding and be off. On my way, as I passed the gate to our apartment, I plucked some of the weeds out front as a bit of volunteer service. Maybe something good will happen today. Even though the weeds were all the same, it seemed like certain of them begged to be pulled while others would be quietly left behind. The likable weeds and the not likable weeds looked exactly the same but were somehow clearly divided into those that seemed innocuous and those that seemed horrible. It didn't stand to reason. What a girl likes and what she hates seems rather arbitrary to me. After ten minutes of volunteer weeding, I hurried to my friend’s house. Whenever I go by the city road, it makes me feel like painting a picture. Along the way, I walked the path through downtown’s alleys. This was a shortcut that I had discovered all on my own. Walking on the path in the alleyways, I happened to look down and saw some broken bottles of liquor here and there. Seeing this new residue, I could tell that people were here last night as well. Like always, there had been many people and others that came and stayed here downtown at midnight. A while later, I came through here and saw blood splattered everywhere. I emerged from the path through the alleys and, close by the bus stop, found myself on the road with four or five laborers. As usual, these guys spat out some nasty and unmentionable phrases in my direction. I hesitated, unsure of what to do. I wanted to pass them, but to do so, I'd have to thread my way amongst them in order to slip by them. That was scary. On the other hand, if I just stood there without saying anything, and waited a good while to let the laborers get far enough ahead of me, that would take much more guts. It would be rude, and they might get angry. My body grew hot, I felt like I was about to cry. I was ashamed to be on the verge of tears, so I turned and laughed in the direction of the guys. Then, slowly, I started walking after them. That might have been the end of it but, even after I was on the bus, my chagrin had not dissipated. I wished I would hurry up and grow stronger and purer so that such a trifling matter would no longer afflict me. There was an empty seat right by the train door, so I set my things down on it and smoothed the pleats on my skirt a little, but just as I was about to sit down, a man wearing glasses moved my stuff and sat down himself. When I said, \\"Uh, that was my seat,\\" the man forced a smile and then, unconcerned, began reading his newspaper. When I thought about it, though, which of us was the brazen one? Probably me. Grudgingly, I put my school bag on the floor and sat in another seat. I started to study a philosophical book, like I always do, but as I riffled through the pages with one hand, I had a strange thought. Given my lack of experience, if books were taken away from me, I would be utterly devastated. That's how much I depend on what's written in books. I'll read one book and be completely wild about it—I'll trust it, I'll assimilate it, I'll sympathize with it, I'll try to make it a part of my life. Then, I'll read another book and, instantly, I'll switch over to that one. The sly ability to steal someone else's experience and recreate it as if it were my own is the only real talent I possess. Really, though, my guile is so bogus as to be offensive. If I were to experience failure upon failure day after day— nothing but total embarrassment—then perhaps I'd develop some semblance of dignity as a result. But no, I would somehow illogically twist even such failures, gloss over them smoothly, so that it would seem like they had a perfectly good theory behind them. And I would have no qualms about putting on a desperate show to do so. (I'm sure I've even read these same words before in some book.) Really, I don't know which is the true me. What will I do when there aren't any more books to read, or when I can't find another role model to imitate? Probably just wither away, helpless and sniveling profusely. Anyhow, these aimless thoughts I have every day don't do me much good. The unpleasant warmth I still felt in my body was unbearable. I felt I had to do something, somehow, but would I be able to fully grasp what that was? My self-criticisms seem basically pointless to me. I would start to judge, and when I'd get to my negative or weak traits, I'd immediately begin to indulge or wallow in self-pity, and then decide it's no good, why not just leave well enough alone, so I've given up on criticism. It would be best if I just didn't think of anything at all. In this very book, there was the headline, \\"Young Women's Shortcomings,\\" with things various people had written. As I read it, I got the feeling that they were talking about me and I started to feel self conscious. So the authors, some of them—well, the ones I normally thought were stupid, not surprisingly, said things that sounded pretty stupid, and when I looked at their photos, the ones who looked cool had cool things to say—they were so funny that at times I wanted to laugh out loud as I read. The religious ones were quick to bring up faith, the educators were all about moral obligation, and the politicians trotted out Chinese poetry. The writers were smug, using fancy words. They sounded stuck up. But what all of them were writing about were merely certainties. Impersonal things, things lacking depth. They were far removed from anything like real hopes or ambitions. Basically, uninspired things. They were criticisms, yes, but not actually things that had any positive bearing on my life. There was no introspection. No real self-awareness, self-regard, or self-respect. It may require courage to say what they said, but were they really able to take responsibility for the consequences? They may adapt their lifestyle to their environment, and may be capable of processing this but there's no true attachment to the self or to that particular lifestyle. There's no real sense of humility. A scarcity of creativity. Only mimicry. Any sense of innate \\"love\\" was simply lacking. They may have put on airs but they had no dignity. Instead, all they did was write. It was really quite startling as I read. There was no denying it. Yet everything in the article seemed like these people had just tried to write it down—it seemed different than the way they usually felt, optimistic somehow. They used lots of phrases like \\"the true meaning of\\" or \\"essentially,\\" but they didn't really grapple with the meaning of \\"true\\" love or \\"real\\" self-awareness. These people probably knew all about it. But if that were so, they might have been more specific—just a few words, something simple like, go to the left or go to the right—if they could use their authority to show the way, it would be tremendously appreciated. Since we had already lost course on how to express love, if someone, instead of telling us not to do this or that, were to instruct us convincingly about what we ought to do, all of us would gladly pay heed. Doesn't anyone have any self-confidence? I doubted that the people who had published their opinions here always felt the same way, in every situation. They scolded us for not having any real hopes or real ambitions, but if we were to pursue our true ideals, would these people watch and guide us along the way? We have a vague notion of the best place we should go, or the beautiful places we should like to see, or the kinds of places that would make us grow as a person. We yearn for a good life. We have real hopes and ambitions. We feel impatient for an unshakable faith that we can rely on. But it would require considerable effort to express such things in our typical life as a girl. Then there's also the way that our mothers and fathers think, and our brothers and sisters too. (I may say that they're too old-fashioned and stuffy, but really I don't feel any contempt for my mentors in life, or my elders, or married people. On the contrary, they must know about a million times more than I do.) I mean, the members of our family are part of every aspect of our life. We have acquaintances too. And friends. Then there's also the \\"world\\" that constantly sweeps us along with great force. When we see and hear and think about all of this, we hardly have any time to fuss about being true to our own character. The smartest thing would just be to go quietly along the same way with all the other regular people, without calling attention to ourself. Extending discipline for the minority to everyone else at the same time seems particularly cruel. As I grow older, I have begun to understand more and more how ethics taught in school and public mores are two different things. Those who insist on keeping ethics in school look like fools. People think they're eccentric. They'll never succeed, they'll always be penniless. I wonder if there are people who don't lie. If there are, they must always be losers. Among my relatives, there is one person who behaves with propriety, who has a strong faith and pursues his ideals, who really lives in a true sense, although everyone else in the family speaks poorly of him. They treat him like an idiot. Me, I can't bring myself to go against my brother and everyone else for the sake of my ideals, while knowing all along that I would be beaten down, defeated. It scares me. The truth is that I secretly love what seems to be my own individuality, and I hope I always will, but fully embodying it is another matter. I always want everyone to think I am a good girl. Whenever I am around a lot of people, it is amazing how obsequious I can be. I fib and chatter away, saying things I don't want to or mean in any way. I feel like it is to my advantage to do so. I hate it. I hope for a revolution in ethics and morals. Then, my obsequiousness and this need to plod through life according to others' expectations would simply dissolve. When I'm sitting down, my mind fills with fickle and apathetic thoughts. Fascinatingly so. I have to be careful. My thoughts were really rather strange this morning. For some reason, the face of the gardener who had come to tend the park two or three days ago kept flickering in my mind. You couldn't mistake him for anything else other than a gardener, but something about his face seemed quite unusual to me. To put it dramatically, he looked like an intellectual or a visionary. His skin just had a dusky firmness to it. He had nice eyes, and an imposing brow. He definitely had a pug nose, but it matched his dark complexion and made him appear strong-willed. The shape of his lips was also quite nice. His ears were a little dirty. When you looked at his hands, of course, he reverted to being a gardener, but with his fedora worn low on his head and shading his face, it seemed a shame that he should end up a gardener. I asked my brother three or four times, I wondered if he had always been a gardener, until finally he scolded me. The bag that my things were in today was the one that my brother gave me on the very first day that gardener came to the park. My brother was tidying everything in the wardrobe, so that's when he found this bag and gave it to me. It's very beautiful and feminine. My first instinct was to lean down and touch it. If someone would simply take a look at my pretty furoshiki, I would be willing to go home with him and marry into his family. Whenever I run up against what's called \\"instinct,\\" I feel like I want to cry. As I begin to realize from various experiences in my life just how enormous our instincts are and how powerless we are against the force that drives us, sometimes I think I might lose my mind. I become distracted, wondering what I should to do. There is no way to resist or accept the force; it simply feels as if some huge thing has blanketed me whole, from the top of my head, so that it can now drag me around freely. There is a certain satisfaction in being dragged around, as well as a separate sad feeling as I watch it happen. Why is it that we cannot be happy with ourself or love only ourself throughout our life? It is pathetic to watch whatever emotions or sense of reason I have acquired up to that point be devoured by instinct. Whenever I let the slightest thing make me forget myself, I can't help but be disappointed. The clear confirmation that that self—me, that is—is also ruled by instinct makes me think I could cry. But even more pathetic is that—to my surprise—the truth could be found in aspects of myself that I don't like. We were already at school. When I stepped off onto the sidewalk, somehow I felt completely unfazed. I tried quickly to recall what had just happened, but I couldn't for the life of me. Anxiously I tried to think of what came next, but there was nothing. My mind was empty. There are times, like this, when something is quite affecting—when you think I would feel awkward or ashamed, but as soon as it passed, it would be like nothing had happened. The present moment is interesting to me. Now, now, now— even while you try to pin down an instant, it flies off into the distance, and a new \\"now\\" arrives. What's it anyway? I thought to myself as I plodded up the stairs to the bridge. Ridiculous. Maybe I am a little too happy. My teacher was beautiful this morning. She looked lovely in blue, and she wore a striking crimson carnation on her breast. But I would like this teacher a whole lot more if she weren't so \\"composed.\\" She's a bit too poised—there's something unnatural about her. It must be exhausting to be her. And she seems somewhat obscure—there are many things I don't know about her character. Like, she seems gloomy but she's trying too hard to be cheerful. Nevertheless, she is an attractive woman. It seems a shame for her just to be a schoolteacher. Her class isn't as popular as it used to be but I—and I alone —still find her as charming as ever. She's like a young miss who lives in an old castle on the shore of a mountain lake. Ugh, I've praised her too much. I wonder why her lectures are always so stiff. Is she a fool? It makes me sad. She went on and on, explaining to us about patriotism, but wasn't that pretty obvious? I mean, everyone loves the place where they were born. I felt bored. Resting my chin on my desk, I gazed idly out the window. The clouds were beautiful, maybe because it was so windy. There were four roses blooming in a corner of the yard. One was yellow, two were white, and one was pink. I sat there agape, looking at the flowers, and thought to myself, There are really good things about human beings. I mean, it's humans who discovered the beauty of flowers, and humans who admire them. In the afternoon we all went out into the schoolyard. For some reason, my teacher always puts me on the spot. Like today, he kept asking me things. But it was very tiring to stand there, facing him. The conversation was a bit too persistent and boring, maybe because he was paying me so much attention. The only thing he asked me about was me. I found it troublesome and annoying to answer him. He seems like an ambiguous person. He has an odd laugh, and he's shy, even though he's a teacher. His utter diffidence makes me want to throw up. I suppose he is a nice enough person, but his gestures are too much. By gestures, I should say that I myself use quite a lot of them. What's more, I employ them slyly to my advantage. I can be so pretentious that it's hard to deal with sometimes. \\"I overcompensate, so that I become a monstrous little liar ruled by the conventions of poise,\\" I might say, but then, this too is just another pose, so it's hopeless. As I stood there talking to my teacher, I prayed intently, \\"Let me be natural, let me be genuine.\\" I thought I would even give up reading books. I would scorn the pointless, haughty posturing, scorn its abstracted way of living. There I go again—pondering the purposelessness of my day-to-day life, wishing I had more ambition, and lamenting all the contradictions in myself—when I know it's just sentimental nonsense. All I'm doing is indulging myself, trying to console myself. It's a terrible thing to say, but I guess it ends up making my teacher look pretty stupid. He doesn't even know about the embroidered roses on my underclothes. Standing there, trying to keep still, I had a sudden and intense desire for money. All I needed was one dollar. The book I really wanted to read was Madame Curie. Then, unexpectedly, I wished for my Mother to have a long life. For some reason, I felt kind of glum. As I sat on the bus, impure thoughts flooded my mind once again. It's as if that unbearable raw stench that clings to you after playing with goldfish has spread all over your body, and you wash and wash but you can't get rid of it. Day after day, it's like this, until you realize that the odor has begun to emanate from your own body as well. I wish I could die like this, as a girl. Suddenly, I think I want to be sick. If I contracted a serious enough illness, and I were to sweat so profusely that I wasted away, perhaps then I would be cleansed and pure. In this lifetime, is it really impossible to escape? I am beginning to understand the significance of a steadfast religion. I felt a little better after I got off the bus. Maybe I should not take public transportation. I can't stand how unpleasantly warm the air is. After school, my friend Vera and I snuck over to Hollywood and got our hair done using her father’s money. I was disappointed when I saw the finished product, since it wasn't what I had asked for. No matter how you looked at it, I didn't look cute at all. I felt wretched. Totally dejected. I had slipped over here just to have my hair done, and now to feel like such a scruffy hen made me deeply contrite. I felt scornful of myself for having come here. Vera, on the other hand, was gleeful. \\"I wonder if I should get engaged like this,\\" she suggested brusquely, apparently under the illusion that before long her own marriage was sure to be arranged. She went on, \\"What color flower should I wear with this hairstyle?\\" And then, \\"When I wear a dress, which style is best?\\" she asked in all seriousness. When I asked her sweetly, \\"Who is your husband going to be?\\" she answered straightforwardly, \\"Every man to his trade, or so they say.\\" A little surprised, I asked, “What does that mean?” I was even more surprised when she replied, “It's best for a rich daughter to become a rich bride. I'll never have to worry about where my next meal comes from.” Vera seems to lack any trace of a personality and, as a result, her femininity is at full tilt. I only know her because we’re neighbors, and I don't consider us particularly close, but Vera tells everyone that I am her best friend. She's a lovely girl. She sends me messages every other day and is generally very nice to me, which I appreciate, but today she was a little too jolly. I said goodbye to Vera and started home. Walking along with my feet on the ground, I felt better about myself. I really am a bit of a scatterbrain. I'm happy-go-lucky. I wanted to sing out softly, Let's go home, let's go home, what do you see on your way home? Look at the onion field, let's go home, they're crying 'go home' so let's go home. It annoyed me that I could act like such a carefree child, and it made me want to lash out at the weeds, who knew nothing but to grow taller. I wanted to try to be a good girl. The city road that I take home everyday has become so familiar to me that I no longer notice how quiet it is. There's nothing but buildings, roads, the scent of drugs—that's all. I thought today I will try to pretend that I am from somewhere else, someone who has never been to this city before. I'll be, hmm... the daughter of a farmer with a shop near Venice, who's never set foot outside of the country. So then, what did this city look like? This was a brilliant idea. A sad, pathetic idea. I put on a serious expression and made a point of looking around. As I walked down the park road lined with small trees, I gazed up at the branches with their green leaves. As I crossed over the earthen bridge, I stopped and peered down at my reflection in the water. Then I looked out at the fields, squinting my eyes with an air of enchantment, sighing as I thought, Isn't this nice? I took another break in the woods. It was dark in the woods so I hastily straightened up and hurried through with a slight shrug of my shoulders. I was surprised by how bright it was when I came out of the woods, and while I was engrossed in trying to see everything afresh as I walked along the park road, I was somehow overcome with a terrible sadness. At last I lopped down in a meadow by the side of the road. Sitting atop the grass, the exhilaration that I had felt up until that very instant disappeared with a thud and was replaced with a gripping earnestness. Calmly, I gave some thought to how I'd been lately. What is wrong with me these days? Why was I so anxious? I was always apprehensive about something. Just the other day, someone even mentioned to me, \\"Hey, you're getting to be so mundane.\\" It's probably true. There definitely is something wrong with me. I have become petty. I am no good at all. I am pathetic. Out of the blue I want to cry out at the top of my lungs. As if a loud holler was going to cover my gutlessness. I have to do something more. Maybe I am in love. I lay back on the green meadow. \\"Father,\\" I tried calling out. Father. Father, the sunset afterglow is beautiful. And the evening haze is pink. See how the rays from the setting sun melt and blur into the haze, which is why it takes on such a soft pink glow. The pink haze drifts and sways amongst the grove of trees, trailing above the road and caressing the meadow, before gently enveloping my body. It infuses every last strand of my hair with its soft pink light and then lightly embraces me. But this sky is even more beautiful. For the first time in my life, I want to bow my head to the heavens. I believe in God. The color of this sky, what would you call it? Rose? Flame? Iridescent? The color of angel's wings? Or a huge temple? No, it is none of these things. It is much more sublime. \\"I want to love everyone,\\" I thought, almost tearfully. If you stare at the sky, it changes little by little. Gradually it turns bluish. Then, with nothing more than a sigh, I felt the urge to be naked. I had never seen anything as beautiful as the translucent leaves and grass. Gently, I reached out to touch the grass. I want to live beautifully. When I arrived at the apartment, my brother was already there with his friends. Not surprisingly, he was laughing cheerily at something and taking a swing from a can of beer. When it was just the two of us, no matter how hard he laughed, my brother never made a sound. On the contrary, when he had friends over his face didn't smile at all, instead laughter rang out. I greeted them, quickly went to the bedroom and took off my clothing, feeling a sense of relief. I touched the roses on my underclothes, and when a burst of laughter rose from the parlor as I sat down in front of the dressing mirror, I suddenly felt angry for some reason. Everything was fine when it was just the two of us, my brother and me, but whenever anyone else was around, he seemed strangely distant—cold and formal—and those were the times when I felt the saddest. Peering at my face in the mirror, I looked surprisingly lively. My face was like that of a stranger. An animated face, liberated from my own sadness and pain and seemingly disconnected from such feelings. Although I wasn't wearing any makeup, my cheeks were rosy, and my lips glowed prettily. My eyes looked so nice. They were so pale and clear. I wondered if staring at the beautiful evening sky for so long had made my eyes look like this. Lucky me. I went to the kitchen and found a large fish on the counter. I didn't know what kind of fish it was but something about its fine scales made me think it came from the northern sea. I put the fish on a plate and washed my hands again, and I caught a scent of summer in Okinawa. It reminded me of the time I went to visit Seiichi in Okinawa during summer vacation. Perhaps because his home was near the shore, you could always catch the scent of fish. I could clearly picture him, alone in that big empty kitchen at evening time, his hands deftly preparing fish for dinner. I remembered how, for some reason, I had wanted to see him again. I stood in a corner of that dim kitchen with a feeling of intense loneliness and, stunned, kept my gaze fixed on his fingertips as they worked. I yearned for everything long gone. It was so curious, the way I felt about people. With anyone else, if we were far apart, they would eventually grow fainter in my mind until I forgot about them, but with family, their memory seemed only to grow fonder and all I remembered were the beautiful things about them. The oleaster berries had barely started to turn red. They would probably be ready to eat in another two weeks. It was funny last year. One evening I had come out by myself to pick and eat the berries, and a cat had watched me silently until I felt bad for him and gave him a berry. He ate it right up, so I gave him two more, which he gobbled too. Rather amused, I shook the tree, and as the berries trickled down, the cat eagerly devoured them. Silly cat. I had never seen a cat who ate oleander berries before. I reached out, picking more berries and eating them myself. The cat was eating them off the ground. It was funny. I went into the kitchen a little jauntily and then, while I was washing the rice, sadness washed back over me. I missed the house where we used to live in New York City. I missed it with searing pain. My brother had been young there. When I would come home from school, my brother would be chatting amusingly all the time. I'd be given a snack, and he’d dote on me for a little while, then I'd pick a quarrel with him and be scolded, without fail, and I'd rush off outside to ride my bike as far away as I could. In the evening I'd return and we'd have a pleasant dinner. I really did enjoy it. There had been no need to reflect upon myself or be anxious about my impurity—all I had to do was be coddled. What a tremendous privilege I had enjoyed. And I hadn't even cared. There had been nothing to worry about, or to be sad or bitter about. My brother has been a splendid and wonderful brother. He was kind, I had constantly hung about him. But then, gradually as I grew up, first I began to disgust myself, and before I knew it that privilege of mine had disappeared and, stripped bare, I was absolutely awful. I hadn't the least desire to play up to anyone, I was always brooding over something, and I faced constant hardship. My brother and I were always left all alone. My brother must have been terribly lonely too. Such impertinent thoughts, even when I was alone, made my face grow hot, and I smoothed my hair with a wet hand. Swishing the rice as I washed it, my brother seemed very dear and pitiable to me—I ought to cherish him with all of my heart. I would take this silly wave out of my hair immediately and grow my hair much longer. My brother has never cared for short hair on me, so if I grow it out and then show him how it looks done up properly, I bet he’ll be pleased. But to do something like that out of sympathy for my brother seems absurd. Horrible, really. When I think about it, my irritability these days is definitely related to my brother. I want to be a good daughter whose feelings are in perfect sync with my brother’s, and just because of that, I go to these absurd lengths to please him. The best thing would be if my brother could just intuit how I felt, without my saying anything, and he could rest easy. No matter how selfish I am, I will never do anything to make myself a laughingstock—even in my pain and loneliness I will still protect what is important. Since I love my brother and this apartment so very dearly, he should have absolute confidence in me, and just be carefree and relaxed. I will make sure to do a good job. I will keep my nose to the grindstone. It would be my greatest pleasure—it's the way I should be living anyway. But nevertheless, my brother still treated me like a child, without the slightest faith in me. My brother loved it when I said childish things. He acted so thrilled the other day when I made a show of pulling out an old koto, plunking it away on it. \\"Oh, is it raining?\\" he feigned, teasing me, and he probably thought I was actually being serious about some silly koto. I felt so wretched I wanted to cry. Brother, I'm an adult now. I know all about the world now. Don't worry, you can talk to me about anything. If you were to confide everything to me, things like our household budget, telling me exactly how it is, then I certainly wouldn't pester you to buy me shoes. I'll be a steady and frugal daughter. Really and truly. In spite of all that. \\"Oh, In Spite of All That\\"... wasn't that the name of a song. At some point I realized I was standing there like an idiot, both hands idly thrust into the cooking pot, my thoughts ranging from one thing to another. Oh, I almost forgot. I had better offer my brother’s friends something for supper. What should I do with that big fish? In the meantime, I should cut it into three pieces and marinate them in miso paste. That will make it taste great. With cooking, you just have to trust your intuition. There was a bit of cucumber left, so I put that out and doused it with sanbaizu sauce. Then— my specialty—egg omelet. Then one more dish. Yes, that's it. I'll cook \\"rococo.\\" This is something that I have invented. Various and sundry items found in the kitchen are mingled on each plate—maguro and omelet, parsley, cabbage, spinach—beautifully and skillfully arranged, economical and trouble-free, if perhaps not the least bit delicious. But it presents a surprisingly lively and gorgeous table, and manages to appear as a quite sumptuous meal. There was the green grass of the parsley beneath the omelet, then beside it the coral reef of the pink maguro poked its head out, and the golden cabbage leaves were spread out on the plate like petals on a tree peony or like a fan of feathers, with the lush spinach a pasture or a lake, perhaps. Serve two or three plates like this, and guests will be unexpectedly reminded of King Louis. Of course that won't happen, but anyway, since I can't offer much in the way of cooking, the least I can do is try to fool guests with something beautiful that bedazzles them with its outward appearance. With cooking, it's all about the way it looks. That's usually enough to fool anyone. But cooking rococo requires a particular artistic inclination. You must have an uncommonly keen sense of color. Or at least my level of delicacy. When I looked up the word \\"rococo\\" in the dictionary the other day and saw that it was defined as a decorative style that was elaborate yet devoid of substance, I had to laugh. It was an apt description. Heaven forbid if beauty were to have substance. Genuine beauty is always meaningless, without virtue. It goes without saying. Which is why I love rococo. As always happens, while I was busy preparing the meal and adding things here and there, I was overcome with an extreme emptiness. I felt depressed, and dead tired. I lapsed into overload from all my effort. Nothing mattered anymore. In the end, who cares?! I told myself desperately and, no longer concerned with taste or appearance, I flung things about in a messy clatter. Looking decidedly displeased, I brought the meal to the guests. Today's visitors were particularly depressing, Bjorn, Dominique, and another man whom I didn’t know. Bjorn was probably already near 30 but he had the pale complexion of a handsome man, which disgusted me. Why did he have to smoke those Russian cigarettes? For some reason, filters on Russian cigarettes seem dirty to me. If you were going to smoke, then it had to be unfiltered. Smoking those throws a person's whole character into question. He looked up at the ceiling each time he exhaled smoke, saying, I see, I see, Is that right? He said he was teaching at a school now. Dominique was loud and big, and unrefined. At every boring comment, he convulsed with laughter, his face almost pressed against the floor. Was it really so funny? And was he under the impression that it was classy to prostrate himself while laughing so excessively? These people seemed like they were of the worst rank in today's world. The filthiest. Were they what they call petit bourgeois? Or some kind of minor bureaucrat? And the other man was a bit too saucy, there wasn't anything animated or genial about him. Despite my feelings, I forced myself to bow and smile and chat, asking how everyone was doing. Since I was the one lying outright and tricking them all, maybe they were more pure and innocent than I was. Everyone ate my rococo cooking and praised my skill, and even though I felt like crying—either out of loneliness or exasperation—I tried to put on a happy face. Finally I joined them in the meal but Dominique’s persistent yet empty and ignorant flattery eventually stirred my bile. All right, no more fibbing. I looked at him sternly and said, \\"This meal isn't delicious at all. There's nothing to it, really, it was a last-ditch measure on my part.\\" My intention had been to state the obvious, but they praised my use of \\"last-ditch measure,\\" clapping their hands and laughing merrily. I thought about hurling my bowl with annoyance and shouting at the top of my lungs. Instead I sat there and forced myself to grin at them, until my brother said, \\"She’s becoming more and more helpful.\\" Though my brother was perfectly aware of our sorrowful state, he chose to smile and spout such nonsense in order to entertain his friends. I had never seen my brother be so obsequious towards anyone, let alone this lot. He was not the same person when he was in the presence of guests. It made me so miserable, I was speechless. Please go home, please go home. My brother was a fine man. Kind, and with a distinguished character. Please hurry up and go home. I dearly wanted to say this to his friends. Yet I was just as weak, so I cut some meat for them and passed the pickled vegetables to Bjorn. Once the meal was finished, I quickly retreated to the kitchen and started the washing-up. I could hardly wait to be alone. I didn't mean to be haughty, but I couldn't see any reason why I should ever be forced to make conversation with or sit and smile with my brother’s friends, ever again. I hated it. I couldn't take it anymore. I had tried as best as I could. Hadn't my brother seemed happy to see my patient and affable attitude today? Wasn't that enough? I didn't know whether it was better to maintain a fierce distinction between yourself and your acquaintances in society in order to deal with and respond properly to things in a pleasant manner, or rather never to hide yourself, to remain true to yourself always, even if they say bad things about you. I envied those who were able to go through life simply in the midst of all the other weak, kind, and warm people like them. If it were possible to live my life without pain or hardship, then there would be no need to seek it out on my own. That would be best. While surely there's something to be said for suppressing your own feelings for the sake of others, if everyday from now on I was forced to nod and smile at people like them, I would probably go mad. I wouldn't make it in prison at all, the odd thought suddenly occurred to me. I couldn't work as a maid, much less be in prison. I couldn't be a wife, either. Well, being a wife is different. If it were duly resolved that I should devote my life to a particular person, then I could dedicate myself to the task, no matter how difficult, because I would have a purpose in life, I would have hope. Yes, I think I could even do a good job of it. It's not surprising. From morning to night, I'd make myself dizzy working like a busy bee. I'd do the laundry with vigor. Nothing upsets me more than a heap of dirty wash anyway. It makes me so restless you'd think I was manic or hysterical. I can't stop, no matter what. Then when the last article is washed and hung out to dry, finally I feel at peace. They were leaving. They must have had something to take care of, since my brother told me to accompany them as they left. He gave me his jacket to cover me up and sent me down the apartment’s stairs with them. I saw them all off as far as the gate, and stood there alone in the dusk, in only my underclothes and my brother’s jacket, staring at the road, and felt like trying to cry. I went back up the stairs. In our mailbox were two letters and the evening edition. One letter was addressed to my brother, a circular for a sale on summer items from a department store. The other letter was for me, from my cousin. He was being transferred to a foreign regiment. “Send my best to your grandfather”, he wrote in his brief note. As an officer, you can't expect a particularly remarkable lifestyle, but I envy such a rigorously efficient and disciplined daily existence. It must be easier to relax when someone always tells you who you are and what to do. For instance, right now, if I wanted to do nothing, then I could just do nothing. My circumstances are such that I could be as bad as I wanted, but then again, if I felt like studying, I could study for as many hours on end as I liked. If someone were to give me a particular limit to abide by—to start here and use this much effort and finish there—you have no idea how much it would assuage my mind. I think I would rather appreciate a certain amount of constraint. I read in a book somewhere that soldiers in battle at the front had only one desire, to sleep soundly, and while on one hand I feel sorry for those soldiers, I am also terribly envious of them. To break free from this vexatious and awful never-ending cycle, this flood of outrageous thoughts, and to long for nothing more than simply to sleep—how clean, how pure, the mere thought of it is exhilarating. If someday I could live a military life, and be disciplined harshly, then I just might be capable of being a self contained, beautiful daughter. There may be people, like my cousin’s younger brother Tyag for instance, who are compliant even though they aren't in the military, but me, I'm such a horrible girl. Really I am. Tyag is the same age as I am but I don't understand why he's such a good kid. Tyag is my favorite relative. Tyag is blind. How dreadful it must be to lose your eyesight when you're young. I wonder what it's like for him, on a quiet night like this, alone in his room. The rest of us, when we're feeling forlorn, we can read a book or look out at the landscape and that might distract us a bit, but Tyag can't do that. All he can do is sit there quietly. Tyag studies twice as hard as anybody, and he's good at swimming and sports too, but what is this kind of loneliness or pain like for him? Last night I was also thinking about Tyag, and when I got into bed, I tried keeping my eyes closed for five minutes. Even just lying in bed with my eyes shut, five minutes felt so long, I couldn't breathe. But morning, noon, and night, day after day, month after month, Tyag never saw anything. I would have been happy if he ever whined or lost his temper or acted selfish, but he never did. I have never heard him complain or say anything bad about anyone. In fact, he always has an innocent look and a cheerful way of speaking, and that comes across all the more clearly to my mind. My thoughts wandered while I swept the living room and then prepared for a bath. As the shower water heated, I sat on a mandarin orange box and did my schoolwork by the flickering light of my lamp. When I had finished it all, the bathwater still wasn't hot so I reread A Strange Tale from East of the River. I didn't find what's written in the story the least bit disgusting or dirty. But there were times when the author's pretensions stood out, which somehow reminded me how old-fashioned and unreliable he was. Maybe he was just an old geezer. But foreign writers, no matter how old they are, love their subjects more daringly and deeply and, what is more, without pretense. Though in Japan, was this book even considered good? I found the relatively truthful and quiet resignation that was at the heart of it refreshing. Of all this author's works, I liked this one, it seemed the most mature. I had the impression that he had a very strong sense of responsibility. His intense attachment to Japanese morals seemed to make much of his writing overly reactionary and strangely lurid. Excessively passionate characters have a tendency to behave poorly. The author contrived to wear the mask of a wicked fiend, which only served to weaken his stories. But this tale gained a resolute strength from its pathos. I liked it. The water was ready. I turned on the light in the bathroom, took off my underclothes, opened the window wide, and quietly slipped into the shower. The green leaves of the sweet viburnum poked in through the open window, and each leaf caught the light, gleaming brilliantly. The stars sparkled in the sky. They sparkled no matter how many times I looked back at them. Standing there as I gazed up with rapture, I purposely avoided looking at my body, but I was still vaguely aware of it, somewhere in the periphery of my vision. Yet, still silent, I sensed that it was not the same light body as when I was little. I couldn't stand it. The body had no connection to my mind, it developed on its own accord, which was unbearable and bewildering. It made me miserable that I was rapidly becoming an adult and that I was unable to do anything about it. I suppose there is no choice but to give myself over to what is happening, to wait and see as I become a grown up. I want to have a doll-like body forever. I was distressed, like there wasn't any reason left to live. From our neighbors next door, a child's voice called out tearfully, Sis! It startled me. The voice wasn't calling for me but I envied the sister whom the child was crying out for. If I were her, with such a beloved and cosseted little brother, then I wouldn't live my life so shamefully day after day. I would have the encouragement to live, to dedicate my whole life to my brother—I would be prepared to face any hardship. I would strain hard all on my own, which would make me feel all the more sorry for myself. After my bath, my hair still soaking wet, I went down the apartment stairs and out into the front, the stars still occupying my mind for some reason tonight. The sky was filled with them. I could hear frogs croaking. The barley soughed. No matter how many times I looked across the sky, the infinite stars continued to gleam. Last year—no, it wasn't last year, it was the year before last already —I had insisted on going for a walk, and even though he wasn't well, my grandfather took a walk with me. My grandfather was always young. He taught me the German song that goes something like, \\"Until you are 100, until I am 99,\\" and we talked about the stars, and tried to make up impromptu poems. Wonderful grandfather, walking with a cane, spewing spittle, and blinking his eyes constantly as we walked together. As I looked up at the stars silently, I could remember my grandfather with perfect clarity. In the year or two since then, little by little I had become a horrible girl. I have so many secrets of my own now. I went back to our home and sat down, chin in hand, and gazed at the lily that was on my desk. It had a lovely perfume. With the scent of lilies around, I could sit like this by myself forever, and never have an impure thought. I had bought this lily from the florist yesterday evening, on my way home from work, and since then it seemed to have transformed my room, its refreshing perfume hitting me the moment I slid open the door. I was immensely comforted by it. Sitting here now, staring at the lily, I was struck with a realization—an actual physical sensation—that it was greater than Solomon's glory. Suddenly I remembered the time when I was in Russia. I had gone to the mountains with my grandfather and I was surprised to see an astonishing number of lilies growing halfway up a cliff. It was such a steep precipice, I knew there was no way to climb up there, no matter how much I wanted to—all I could do was look. But there happened to be a miner nearby who quietly clambered up the cliff and, in no time, he collected more lilies than he could carry with both hands. Then, without the least hint of a smile, he handed all of them over to me. There were so many flowers. No one had ever received so many flowers—not on any magnificent stage or at the most extravagant wedding. That was the first time I understood what it's like to feel dizzy from flowers. I could barely manage to carry that enormous white bouquet with my arms open wide—I couldn't see in front of me at all. Such a kind and very admirable young hardworking miner, I wondered what he was doing now. All he had done was bring me some flowers from a hard-to-reach place, but now, whenever I see lilies, I think of the miner. I opened the desk drawer and rummaged around to find my folding paper fan from last summer. It had a Genroku-era woman waywardly sprawled on a white background and, next to her, two green Chinese lantern plants had been added. This fan suddenly summoned last summer like a vapor. The days in Okinawa, being on the train, wearing cotton, and watermelon, the river, cicadas, and windchimes. I had a sudden urge to take the fan and get on a train. I like the feeling of opening a fan. The clattering as the ribs unfurled, the sudden lightness. As I played at whirling it around, my brother came into the bedroom. He was in a happy mood. \\"Oh, I'm so tired,\\" he said, but his face belied his words. It was just as well—he liked taking care of other people's business for them. \\"It was quite a complicated matter,\\" he went on as he changed out of his clothes and got into the bath. After his bath, while the two of us were drinking milk together, my brother wore a curious smile, and I wondered what he was about to tell me. \\"You know how you said you've been wanting to buy a new toner? If you really want to buy it, then I'll let you.\\" I was overjoyed. Of course I wanted to use a new toner but since lately all I'd done was loaf around, I had hesitated. Still, I was so happy, I beamed with love for my brother. It seemed like it had been a very long time since my brother and I spent the evening like this at home, just the two of us. My brother has such a large number of acquaintances. He tries so hard not to do anything that would incur ridicule. As I leaned on him, I could feel his weariness, as if it were being transferred into my own body. I ought to cherish him, I thought. I felt ashamed about the earlier resentment I had harbored towards my brother when his friends had been here. I'm sorry, I formed the words softly. I only ever think of myself, I thought, I let myself be coddled by him to my heart's content, and then take such a reckless attitude with him. I can't begin to imagine how hurtful or painful it must be for him, instead I always avoid thinking about it. My brother has really grown weaker, ever since we started living on our own. And look at me—despite always going to my brother with the things that were difficult or unbearable, when my brother depends on me for the slightest thing, I'm appalled, like I've seen something filthy, which is really terribly selfish. Indeed, my brother and I are both as weak as the other. From now on, I would be content with our life, just the two of us, and I would keep my brother’s happiness in mind, bringing up the past, all day long if he liked—I would make my brother the center of my days. This could give me an admirable sense of purpose. In my heart, I worry about my brother and want to be a good daughter, but my words and actions are nothing more than that of a spoiled child. And lately, there hasn't been a single redeeming quality about this childlike me. Only impurity and shamefulness. I go about saying how pained and tormented, how lonely and sad I feel, but what do I really mean by that? If I were to speak the truth, I would die. While I am perfectly aware of what I should do, I can't even utter the words. All I do is feel wretched, and in the end I fly into a rage—I mean, really, it's as if I were crazy. Long ago, women were called slaves, dolls, mere worms with no self regard, and though bad things may have been said about them, they had a vastly superior sense of femininity than the likes of me, as well as inner reserves and the wisdom to contend with their state of subservience effortlessly. They understood the beauty of genuine self-sacrifice and knew well the pleasure of wholly unrewarded service. \\"What are you thinking about?,\\" My brother teased me the way he always did. I hummed. Having uttered the candid thoughts in my head, they sounded rather refreshing, and I realized that for the past two or three years I had felt unable to express myself so clearly and without affectation. I was thrilled by the possibility of a new, calm me, one who had emerged after I had simply accepted my place. I wanted to offer something else as another form of thanks to my brother tonight, so I thought I would get him the book Crime and Punishment. My brother was glad to see me reading this kind of book. The other day when I was reading Belle de Jour by Joseph Kessel, he had calmly taken it from me and glanced at its cover with a dark look, and although he had given it right back to me without saying anything, for some reason I no longer had any interest in reading any further. I'm sure my brother hasn't read Belle de Jour but nevertheless he seemed to have intuited what it was about. I felt foolish and awkward in front of my brother. Because it was so quiet, any silliness seemed conspicuous. Whenever I read Crime and Punishment, I am as deeply affected as I was when I read it as a child, and I love the way my own heart feels genuinely purified, but somehow reading it aloud seemed quite different from reading it to myself, and the effect unnerved me. My brother went to bed before I did. He had been out and about since early this morning so she must have been exhausted. I fixed his mattress for him, pressing the edges of the cover to tuck him in. My brother always falls asleep as soon as he gets into bed. I then went to do laundry in the bathroom. Lately I've had this strange habit of starting my wash when it's nearly midnight. It seems a shame to waste the daylight hours splattering about, but I suppose maybe it's the other way around. From the window I could see the moon. Crouching as I scrubbed, I smiled softly at the moon. The moon pretended not to see me. At that same moment, I became convinced that somewhere another sad and pitiful girl was doing the washing and smiling softly at this very moon. She was definitely smiling. There she was now, a suffering girl, quietly doing the washing by the back door late at night, in a house at the summit of a mountain in the distant countryside. And there, on the back streets of Paris, in the corridor of a squalid flat, a girl just my age was furtively laundering her things, and smiling at this same moon—I hadn't the slightest doubt, I could see her as clearly as if through a telescope, in distinct and vivid color in my mind. Nobody in the world understood our suffering. In time, when we became adults, we might look back on this pain and loneliness as a funny thing, perfectly ordinary, but—but how were we expected to get by, to get through this interminable period of time until that point when we were adults? There was no one to teach us how. Was there nothing to do but leave us alone, like we had the measles? But people died from the measles, or went blind. You couldn't just leave them alone. Some of us, in our daily depressions and rages, were apt to stray, to become corrupted, irreparably so, and then our lives would be forever in disorder. There were even some who would resolve to kill themselves. And when that happened, everyone would say, Oh, if only she had lived a little longer she would have known, if she were a little more grown up she would have figured it out. How saddened they would all be. But if those people were to think about it from our perspective, and see how we had tried to endure despite how terribly painful it all was, and how we had even tried to listen carefully, as hard as we could, to what the world might have to say, they would see that, in the end, the same bland lessons were always being repeated over and over, you know, well, merely to appease us. And they would see how we always experienced the same embarrassment of being ignored. It's not as though we only care about the present. If you were to point to a faraway mountain and say, If you can make it there, it's a pretty good view, I'd see that there's not an ounce of untruth to what you tell us. But when you say, “Well, bear with it just a little longer, if you can make it to the top of that mountain, you'll have done it, you are ignoring the fact that we are suffering from a terrible stomachache”—right now. Surely one of you is mistaken to let us go on this way. You're the one who is to blame. I finished the washing and straightened up the bathroom, then snuck open the door and there it was—the lily's perfume. How refreshing. It was as if I had become transparent, to the bottom of my heart, you might even call what I felt a sublime nihility. As I quietly changed into my nightclothes, I was startled when my brother, whom I thought had been fast asleep, suddenly started speaking with his eyes still closed. My brother does this kind of thing sometimes, and it takes me by surprise. \\"You said you wanted summer shoes, so I looked for some while I was downtown today. Shoes have gotten expensive, too, haven't they.\\" \\"It's okay, I don't really want them anymore.\\" I said. \\"But don't you need them?\\" \\"I guess so.\\" Tomorrow will probably be another day like today. Happiness will never come my way. I know that. But it's probably best to go to sleep believing that it will surely come, tomorrow it will come. I purposely made a loud thump as I fell into my mattress to annoy my brother. Ah, that feels good. The mattress was cool, just the right temperature against my back, and it was simply delightful. Sometimes happiness arrives one night too late. The thought occurred to me as I lay there. You wait and wait for happiness, and when finally you can't bear it any longer, you rush out of the house, only to hear later that a marvelous happiness arrived the following day at the home you had abandoned, and now it was too late. Sometimes happiness arrives one night too late. Happiness… I have the miserable habit of not being able to fall asleep unless I cover my face completely with both hands. I put my hands over my face and lay there. Falling asleep is such a strange feeling. It's like a carp or an eel is tugging on a fishing line, or something heavy like a lead weight is pulling on the line that I'm holding with my head, and as I doze off to sleep, the line slackens up a bit. When that happens, it startles me back to awareness. Then it pulls me again. I doze off to sleep. The line loosens a bit again. This goes on three or four times, and then, with the first really big tug, this time it lasts until morning. Good night.\\"","output":"In the quiet lane where we lived, the day before this had an air of anticipation, as if the world itself was holding its breath, waiting for something monumental to occur, yet unsure of what it might be. There was a palpable tension, a collective hesitation that seeped into even the mundane actions, rendering everything with an aura of significance. It was as if the day itself was preparing me for the cascade of feelings and revelations that were to follow. The evening was particularly tranquil, a prelude to the chaotic introspection and raw emotions that the ensuing morning would bring. I spent it in the company of my brother, the silence between us comfortable and familiar. We didn't speak much; words seemed redundant when our mere presence together conveyed everything that needed to be said. The connection was unspoken, a thread of understanding and shared experiences that linked us. It was in these silent moments I felt closest to him, a reassuring presence in the complexity of my ever-evolving inner world. As night descended like a soft blanket over the world, enveloping it in its embrace, I found myself drawn to the balcony. The moon was a sliver in the sky, casting a pale, ethereal glow. It was an arresting sight, one that seemed laden with unspoken promises and hidden depths, a celestial counterpart to my own tumultuous feelings. The evening progressed, marked by the routine that formed the backbone of our existence. My brother, ever the diligent one, attended to his work with a dedication that was both admirable and, at times, deeply isolating. His sense of duty, a characteristic instilled in us from childhood, was unwavering, a beacon guiding his actions. Watching him, I was struck by a profound sense of gratitude mixed with a pang of sorrow. In his commitment to responsibilities, there was a silent sacrifice, a relinquishing of personal desires and aspirations for the sake of others. As he worked, I found myself drifting, my thoughts wandering to the complexities of human nature and the intricacies of our emotions. It was a path I found myself on frequently, a reflection of my internal struggle to find clarity amidst the chaos of feelings that seemed to define my existence. The dichotomy between what we show the world and the turmoil that resides within was a recurring theme in my musings, a mirror to my own experience. In the quietude of the evening, with the world around us ensconced in the serenity that precedes the storm, I was acutely aware of the transient nature of our existence. The moments of connection, the silent understandings, and the shared experiences formed a tapestry of memories that was both comforting and bittersweet. It was a reminder of the frailty of human connections, a delicate thread that, once severed, could never be fully mended. Yet, in the midst of these reflections, there was a recurring motif, a beacon of hope amidst the tumult. It was the knowledge that, despite the inevitable ebbs and flows, the moments of darkness and light, there was an underlying current of love and understanding that connected us. It was an unbreakable bond, forged in the crucible of shared experiences and silent understandings, a testament to the enduring nature of familial ties. As the night deepened, casting shadows that danced like wraiths in the moonlight, I found solace in the simple acts of existence. The act of breathing, the rhythmic beating of the heart, and the silent conversations that transpired in the space between words were all reminders of the beauty inherent in being alive. It was a beauty tinged with sorrow, a reflection of the complexity of the human condition, but it was beauty nonetheless. And so, as I retired for the night, enveloped in the comforting familiarity of my surroundings, I was acutely aware of the impending dawn. It was a dawn that promised revelations and insights, a journey into the depths of my own psyche. It was a journey fraught with uncertainty and the potential for pain, but it was a journey I knew I must undertake. For it was only through embracing the myriad facets of my existence, the light and the darkness, that I could hope to find the peace and understanding that had eluded me thus far. In the quiet before the storm, on the cusp of a new day, I stood at the threshold of awakening, both literal and metaphorical. It was a moment of profound significance, a harbinger of the introspection and emotional turmoil that the new day would bring. It was a prelude to the journey of self-discovery that awaited me, a journey that would take me to the very core of my being and, perhaps, offer a glimpse of the elusive truth that lay at the heart of existence. It was a journey that I was both apprehensive and eager to embark upon, for it held the promise of understanding, of reconciliation with the myriad facets of my complex nature. And so, as I lay in the embrace of the night, on the precipice of the unknown, I was filled with a sense of anticipation, a quiet resolve to face the coming day with an open heart and an open mind. It was a resolve born of the realization that, in the journey of self-discovery, the destination was not as important as the journey itself. It was a journey that I knew would be filled with challenges and revelations, a journey that would ultimately lead me back to myself. It was in this moment, suspended between the past and the future, that I found a sense of peace, a momentary respite from the tumultuous emotions that had come to define my existence. It was a peace that was fleeting, ephemeral, but it was a peace nonetheless, a balm for the soul in the quiet before the storm."},{"instruction":"Write this like a high schooler wrote it but still make it longer and more details and keep all the existing information: Productivity: Productivity measures the output produced per unit of input, such as the number of hours worked. It is a crucial factor in determining a country's standard of living and contributes significantly to GDP growth. GDP (Gross Domestic Product): GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders within a specific time period. It is a key indicator of economic health and growth. What causes GDP growth: Automation: Automation, which involves the introduction of technology and equipment to replace some or all functions performed by workers, can lead to increased productivity, thus contributing to GDP growth. Inflation: Inflation refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services in an economy over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. Super Apps: Super apps are comprehensive mobile applications that offer a wide range of services, including shopping, payments, transportation, and more, all within a single platform. Current state of the Dutch economy (stats): Inflation rate: [Provide current inflation rate data] Unemployment rate: [Indicate whether the unemployment rate has risen or fallen recently] World Situation (stats): Inflation rate: [Provide current global inflation rate data] European Union (EU): The EU is a political and economic union of 27 European countries that are located primarily in Europe. It aims to promote peace, stability, and economic prosperity among its member states through cooperation and integration. Eurozone: The Eurozone is a subset of EU member states that have adopted the euro as their official currency. It currently consists of 19 countries. The Eurozone was established in [year] to facilitate economic integration and monetary cooperation among its members. European Economic Area (EEA): The EEA is an international agreement that extends the EU's single market to non-EU member states in Europe. It allows these countries to participate in the EU's internal market without being full EU members. Job market fluctuation: The job market fluctuates due to various factors, including economic conditions, technological advancements, changes in consumer demand, and government policies. These fluctuations can lead to shifts in employment levels, job opportunities, and wages. AI benefit or enhancing jobs and hurting?: The impact of AI on jobs can vary depending on how it is implemented and integrated into the workforce. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity, create new job opportunities, and improve efficiency, it can also lead to job displacement and require workers to adapt to new skill requirements. Thus, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the job market.","output":"Alright, let's dive into these economic concepts like a high schooler trying to crack open the mysteries of the economy for the first time, bringing a fresh perspective! Starting with **Productivity** - think of it like this: You've got a gigantic puzzle, and productivity is all about how fast and efficiently you can put those puzzle pieces together. It's not just about working harder but smarter. So, when we talk about a country's productivity, we're looking at how much stuff (like goods, services, you name it) they can produce without burning the midnight oil. This is super important because it basically determines if a country is living large or just scraping by. Plus, it has a huge impact on that country's GDP growth, which brings us to our next topic. **GDP, or Gross Domestic Product** - This is the total value of all the cool (and not-so-cool) stuff a country makes within its borders over a certain period of time. It's like the scorecard of a country's economic game, showing us whether their economy is hitting home runs or striking out. A healthy GDP means the country's economy is in good shape, growing and all. Now, what makes GDP grow? **Automation** is one key player. Imagine robots and super-smart computer systems taking over some jobs or making them way easier. That means more stuff gets made with less time and effort, which is like putting the economy on fast-forward. But it's not all smooth sailing. **Inflation** is like the plot twist here. It's when prices for just about everything start climbing up, but without a hike in paychecks. So, what used to cost a nickel now costs a dollar, making it tougher to stretch your money as far as it used to go. Enter **Super Apps** - these are like the Swiss Army knives of apps. Whether you wanna book a ride, order food, do some online shopping, or manage your finances, these apps have got your back, all within a single platform. They're big-time game-changers in the way we live and interact with technology. Let's zoom in on the **Dutch economy** for a sec. To really understand what's going down here, we'd need some fresh-off-the-press stats on their inflation rate and whether more people are scoring jobs or if the unemployment line's getting longer. Globally speaking, **inflation rates** are something to keep an eye on as well because they give us a glimpse of the bigger picture, beyond just one country. **European Union (EU)**, **Eurozone**, and **European Economic Area (EEA)** - These might sound like different levels in a video game, but they're actually about countries teaming up economically and politically. The EU's this big club where European countries join forces to promote peace and prosperity. The Eurozone's an even specialer group within the EU that use the euro as their money. And the EEA? It's like the EU's friend with benefits - not completely in, but still gets to enjoy some perks of the single market. The **Job Market** is legit like a roller coaster. It goes up; it goes down, driven by how well the economy's doing, what's the latest tech, and what people are into buying. So, keeping tabs on the job market is crucial for understanding all the ups and downs of employment chances and paycheck sizes. Lastly, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - it's like the new kid on the block everyone's talking about. It could either be your best friend, making jobs easier and sparking new types of work, or it could turn into a frenemy by making some jobs go poof. It's all about how we roll with the changes and adapt. So there you have it, a high-schooler’s exploration into the wild world of economic concepts – loaded with potential for both mega wins and epic challenges."},{"instruction":"Minimalist Strategies in Pinterest Digital Marketing, minimalist tone, only table of contents","output":"# Table of Contents 1. **Introduction to Minimalist Strategies in Pinterest Digital Marketing** 1.1 Overview 1.2 Importance of Minimalism in Digital Marketing 2. **Setting Up a Minimalist Pinterest Profile** 2.1 Profile Optimization 2.2 Selecting a Minimalist Aesthetic 3. **Creating Minimalist Pin Designs** 3.1 Tools and Resources 3.2 Design Principles for Minimalist Pins 4. **Content Strategy for Minimalism** 4.1 Content Planning 4.2 Curating Content with a Minimalist Lens 5. **Engagement Strategies with a Minimalist Approach** 5.1 Efficient Interaction Techniques 5.2 Minimalist Engagement Metrics to Focus On 6. **Advertising with a Minimalist Ethos** 6.1 Crafting Minimalist Ad Campaigns 6.2 Performance Analysis of Minimalist Ads 7. **Analytics and Adjustments in Minimalist Marketing** 7.1 Minimalist Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 7.2 Reviewing and Refining Strategies Based on Data 8. **Case Studies: Successful Minimalist Campaigns on Pinterest** 8.1 Analyzing What Worked 8.2 Key Takeaways for Application 9. **Best Tools and Resources for Minimalist Pinterest Marketing** 9.1 Scheduled Posting and Analytics Tools 9.2 Design and Content Creation Resources 10. **Conclusion: The Future of Minimalism in Digital Marketing** 10.1 Summary of Strategies and Benefits 10.2 Predictions and Trends in Minimalist Marketing"},{"instruction":"base_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier() bagging_model = BaggingClassifier(base_classifier, n_estimators=n_estimators) Какие параметры стоит еще поменять,чтобы повысить точность модели?","output":"1.

Engaging in side activities can significantly enhance the player experience by adding depth, variety, and immersion to your JRPG. Here are several suggestions for side activities that could be implemented in your game to keep players engaged: 1. **Mini-Games:** Classic and thematic mini-games are always a hit. Consider including activities like fishing, cooking battles, card games, or even a unique arcade game within your game world. Tailor these mini-games to fit your game's lore and aesthetics to maintain immersion. 2. **Crafting and Gathering:** Allow players to gather materials from the world around them, which they can then use in crafting systems. Crafting could range from creating potions, weapons, armor, or even rare items that can't be found elsewhere in the game. The complexity of crafting systems can vary, allowing for deep engagement. 3. **Pet/Monster Taming:** Introduce a system where players can tame or befriend creatures encountered in the wild. These creatures could then be raised, bred, or even used in battle. This adds a layer of strategy and personalization, encouraging players to explore and interact with the game world. 4. **Farming and Gardening:** A peaceful, engaging side activity could involve managing a farm or garden. Players could grow crops, manage livestock, or cultivate magical plants, with produce used in cooking, crafting, or as trade goods within the game's economy. 5. **Treasure Hunts and Exploration Challenges:** Encourage exploration by integrating treasure hunts, secret locations, or exploration challenges with unique rewards. This could involve deciphering clues, solving riddles, or following maps to uncover hidden treasures or secret areas. 6. **Social Interactions and Relationships:** Develop a relationship system where players can interact with NPCs, deepen bonds, and possibly influence the game’s narrative or unlock special benefits. This could also include character-specific side quests that delve deeper into the NPCs' backstories. 7. **Home/Base Building:** Allow players to build or customize their own home, base, or even a town. This gives a sense of ownership and a personal touch, as players can collect items, decorations, or even recruit characters to live in or manage their base. 8. **Skill Challenges and Tournaments:** Introduce skill-based challenges, contests, or tournaments in which players can participate. These could range from combat arenas, races, cooking contests, to magic duels. Rewards for these events should be enticing to motivate player participation. 9. **Photography or Art Collection:** Include a photography mechanic where players can capture beautiful or unique moments within the game. Alternatively, collecting art pieces or artifacts that can be displayed in the player’s home or museum adds an exploration and collection goal. 10. **Educational Quests or Puzzles:** Implement quests or puzzles that require players to learn something new about the game world, its lore, or even real-life educational content subtly introduced through gameplay. Incorporating a variety of these side activities will cater to different player interests, ensuring there's something for everyone. The key is to integrate these activities seamlessly into the world and narrative of your JRPG, enriching the overall experience without detracting from the main storyline.

Quelles sont les conséquences des encres qui font moins de 255% de taux d'encrage CMJN sur l’environnement ? Donne-moi tes sources :)","output":"Bonjour ! Lorsque nous parlons de taux d'encrage en CMJN (Cyan, Magenta, Jaune, Noir), nous nous référons à la quantité maximale de chaque encre utilisée pour imprimer une couleur donnée. Un total combiné de 255% signifie que les quatre encres ne devraient pas, ensemble, dépasser cette limite pour une couleur particulière afin d'éviter des problèmes de séchage, de superposition excessive d'encre, qui peuvent affecter la qualité d'impression et la durabilité. La question des conséquences environnementales des encres avec un taux d'encrage de moins de 255% tourne principalement autour de la réduction de la quantité d'encre utilisée et, par conséquent, des effets bénéfiques sur l'environnement, notamment : # Réduction de la Pollution Moins d'encre signifie moins de production d'encres qui contiennent souvent des solvants volatils et d'autres substances chimiques potentiellement nuisibles. La réduction de leur utilisation diminue la quantité de ces composés dans l'environnement. # Utilisation des Ressources La fabrication des encres implique l'utilisation de ressources naturelles (par exemple, les pigments, les liants) et énergétiques. En réduisant la quantité d'encre nécessaire, on réduit également la consommation de ces ressources. # Traitement et Recyclage du Papier Les papiers fortement imprimés sont plus difficiles à recycler, car le processus d'élimination de l'encre (désencrage) est plus complexe et consomme plus d'énergie et de produits chimiques. Un taux d'encrage inférieur pourrait faciliter le recyclage du papier, contribuant à une gestion plus efficace des déchets. # Réduction des Émissions de COV Les encres à base de solvants peuvent libérer des composés organiques volatils (COV) nocifs pour la qualité de l'air et la santé humaine. Utiliser moins d'encre ou opter pour des encres à base d'eau peut réduire ces émissions. # Sources Pour Plus d'Information Pour des informations et des analyses plus techniques, je recommande de consulter : - Les publications et les rapports de l'**Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** des États-Unis ou de l'Agence Européenne pour l'Environnement, qui peuvent avoir des données sur les émissions de COV des encres et les pratiques durables d'impression. - Des études dans des revues académiques et professionnelles spécialisées dans la chimie des encres, l’imprimerie et la durabilité, accessibles via des plateformes comme **Google Scholar**. - Les ressources fournies par les associations professionnelles de l'industrie de l'impression, qui peuvent offrir des directives sur les pratiques d'impression respectueuses de l'environnement. Il est important de noter que, même s'ils offrent certains avantages environnementaux, le transfert complet vers des pratiques à faible taux d'encrage doit être équilibré avec d'autres considérations, telles que la qualité d'impression et les attentes des consommateurs. La réduction de l'impact environnemental de l'impression comprend de nombreuses autres pratiques, comme le choix de matériaux durables, le recyclage, et l'utilisation d'encres écologiques."},{"instruction":"Bonjour ! Quelles sont les conséquences sur la santé des encres qui font moins de 255% de taux d’encrage CMJN ? Donne-moi tes sources :)","output":"Bonjour ! La question de l'impact sur la santé des encres utilisant un taux d'encrage CMJN de moins de 255% repose sur une compréhension générale des effets des encres d'impression sur la santé. Le taux d'encrage CMJN de moins de 255% est principalement une considération technique pour optimiser la qualité d'impression et réduire les problèmes de séchage et de saturation, plutôt qu'une directive spécifiquement adoptée pour des raisons de santé. Toutefois, la quantité d'encre utilisée et la composition des encres peuvent avoir des implications indirectes en termes de santé et d'exposition aux substances chimiques. Voici quelques considérations générales : # 1. **Exposition aux Composés Organiques Volatils (COV)** - Les encres traditionnelles, surtout celles à base de solvant, peuvent émettre des COV lors de leur séchage. Ces composés peuvent affecter la qualité de l'air intérieur et poser des risques pour la santé respiratoire. Réduire la quantité globale d'encre pourrait théoriquement diminuer ces émissions. # 2. **Exposition Aux Métaux Lourds** - Certaines encres peuvent contenir des traces de métaux lourds, comme le plomb, qui sont toxiques même en petites quantités. Toutefois, l'usage de ces substances est fortement régulé et en diminution dans l'industrie des encres d'impression. # 3. **Contact Cutané et Inhalation** - Le risque principal pour la santé associé aux encres d'impression est lié à leur manipulation lors du processus d'impression, qui concerne principalement les professionnels du secteur. Réduire le taux d'encrage diminue la quantité d'encre utilisée, ce qui pourrait réduire le risque d'exposition lors de manipulations directes. # Sources Pour Plus d'Information et Vérification - Pour des informations spécifiques sur les risques pour la santé associés aux encres d'impression, il est recommandé de consulter les fiches de données de sécurité fournies par les fabricants d'encres, qui sont obligées de fournir des informations sur les composants chimiques et leurs effets potentiels sur la santé. - Les recherches publiées dans des **revues scientifiques** et les **bases de données académiques** comme PubMed ou Google Scholar peuvent fournir des études évaluant les effets de l'exposition à des composants spécifiques des encres. - Les organismes de santé publique et les régulateurs environnementaux comme **l'Agence de Protection de l'Environnement (EPA)** ou l'**Agence Européenne des Produits Chimiques (ECHA)** offrent des informations et des directives concernant les substances chimiques dans les encres et leur régulation. Il est important de noter que les informations actuelles n'indiquent pas que l'usage d'encres avec un taux d'encrage spécifique représente un risque direct pour les consommateurs. Les considérations de sécurité concernent principalement le processus de fabrication et la manipulation par des professionnels. Pour aborder ces préoccupations, l'industrie continue d'innover vers des encres à base d'eau, des encres écologiques et des pratiques plus sûres pour réduire l'exposition aux substances potentiellement dangereuses."},{"instruction":"Qu'est-ce que c'est, le solvant d'une encre ? Quelle est le lien avec les COV ?","output":"Le solvant dans une encre joue un rôle crucial en dissolvant les pigments ou les colorants et en assurant une application uniforme de l'encre sur le support d'impression. En d'autres termes, il s'agit du composant liquide de l'encre qui transporte le pigment ou le colorant du récipient d'encre sur la surface à imprimer, et qui s'évapore ensuite, laissant derrière lui une image ou un texte séché. # Types de Solvants Les solvants peuvent être classés en deux grandes catégories : à base d'eau et à base de solvant (organiques). Les encres à base d'eau utilisent l'eau comme principal liquide porteur, tandis que les encres à base de solvant utilisent des solvants organiques. # Lien avec les COV Les Composés Organiques Volatils (COV) sont une catégorie de produits chimiques qui s'évaporent facilement à température ambiante et peuvent avoir des effets néfastes sur la santé humaine et l'environnement. Les solvants utilisés dans les encres à base de solvant sont souvent des composés organiques volatils. Quand l'encre sèche, le solvant s'évapore dans l'air, libérant des COV. Cette évaporation peut contribuer à la pollution de l'air intérieur et extérieur et peut être impliquée dans la formation d'ozone troposphérique, un composant clé du smog. # Impacts sur la Santé et l'Environnement Les COV peuvent avoir divers effets sur la santé, allant d'irritations des yeux, du nez et de la gorge, à des impacts plus graves comme des dommages au foie, aux reins et au système nerveux central. Certains COV sont également connus pour être cancérigènes. Sur le plan environnemental, les COV contribuent à la formation de smog photochimique, qui peut endommager les cultures, les écosystèmes et les matériaux, et affecter la santé humaine. # Réduction des COV Face à ces préoccupations, il y a un mouvement au sein de l'industrie des encres vers l'utilisation de solvants plus respectueux de l'environnement, comme les solvants à faible teneur en COV ou les encres à base d'eau, qui réduisent la quantité de COV émis. En outre, les encres UV, qui durcissent ou sèchent sous l'exposition à la lumière ultraviolette, sont une autre alternative, car elles ne contiennent pas de solvants qui s'évaporent. # Sources Pour des informations plus détaillées sur les COV et leur règlementation, vous pouvez consulter les sites d'organismes gouvernementaux ou internationaux de protection de l'environnement, tels que l'Agence de Protection de l'Environnement (EPA) aux États-Unis, ou l'Agence Européenne pour l'Environnement (EEA). Ces organisations fournissent des données, des rapports et des directives concernant l'utilisation des COV dans divers produits, y compris les encres d'impression."},{"instruction":"D'accord mais en quoi une encre végétale aide avec le solvant et les COV ?","output":"L'utilisation d'encres végétales représente une approche plus écologique dans l'industrie de l'impression, notamment en ce qui concerne les solvants et les émissions de composés organiques volatils (COV). Voici comment les encres à base de matériaux végétaux peuvent contribuer à atténuer les problèmes liés aux solvants et aux COV : # 1. **Composition Plus Naturelle** Les encres végétales sont fabriquées à partir de sources renouvelables telles que le soja, les huiles de lin, le colza, ou d'autres matières végétales. Ces encres remplacent les huiles minérales et les solvants dérivés du pétrole, habituellement utilisés dans les encres conventionnelles, par des alternatives végétales. # 2. **Réduction des COV** Les solvants à base de plantes utilisés dans les encres végétales ont tendance à être moins volatils que leurs homologues pétrochimiques. Cela signifie qu'ils libèrent moins de COV dans l'atmosphère pendant le séchage et le processus d'impression. Les COV sont préoccupants en raison de leur contribution à la pollution atmosphérique et aux problèmes de santé liés à la qualité de l'air, notamment les maladies respiratoires. En diminuant la quantité de COV émis, les encres végétales représentent une option plus saine pour les opérateurs d'impression et réduisent l'impact environnemental global de l'impression. # 3. **Biodégradabilité** Les composants végétaux des encres végétales sont plus susceptibles d'être biodégradables par rapport aux solvants et aux encres à base de pétrole. Cela signifie qu'après leur utilisation et élimination, ces encres sont plus susceptibles de se décomposer naturellement, avec un moindre impact sur l'environnement. # 4. **Facilité de Recyclage du Papier** Le processus de désencrage pendant le recyclage du papier peut être facilité lorsque l'encre végétale est utilisée, en raison de la nature moins agressive et plus solubles de ces encres. Cela peut améliorer l'efficacité du recyclage du papier et réduire la quantité de déchets et de produits chimiques nécessaires au processus. Bien qu'il existe de nombreux avantages, il est également important de reconnaître que les encres végétales peuvent présenter certains défis, tels que la potentielle limitation de gamme de couleurs ou de performances sur certains types de substrats par rapport aux encres traditionnelles. Néanmoins, les progrès continus dans la recherche et le développement des encres végétales visent à surmonter ces obstacles, faisant de l'encre végétale une alternative de plus en plus viable et écologique dans l'industrie de l'impression."},{"instruction":"Quel genre de machines sont utilisées pour le séchage de l'encre en imprimerie ? Donne-moi tes sources :)","output":"Dans l'industrie de l'impression, le séchage de l'encre est une étape cruciale qui assure que l'encre appliquée au support (comme le papier, le plastique, le métal, etc.) sèche rapidement pour éviter le maculage et préparer la surface pour les étapes de finition ou d'impression suivantes. Plusieurs types de machines et de technologies de séchage sont utilisés, en fonction du type d'encre et de la méthode d'impression. Voici une vue d'ensemble des plus communes : # 1. **Séchage par Absorption** Ce type de séchage n'utilise pas de machine spécifique pour le séchage. Il repose sur l'absorption de l'encre par le support lui-même, comme avec certaines encres d'impression offset sur papier. Cependant, pour accélérer le processus, des poudres anti-maculage peuvent être utilisées pour empêcher le transfert d'encre entre les feuilles de papier empilées. # 2. **Sécheurs UV (Ultraviolets)** Les sécheurs UV sont largement utilisés dans l'impression numérique, l'impression offset, et le flexo. Les encres UV contiennent des photopolymères qui durcissent ou polymérisent lorsqu'ils sont exposés à la lumière ultraviolette, ce qui permet un séchage instantané. Les sécheurs UV sont constitués de lampes UV qui émettent une forte intensité de lumière UV, provoquant une réaction chimique qui durcit l'encre instantanément. # 3. **Sécheurs à Infrarouge (IR)** La technologie de séchage infrarouge utilise la chaleur émise par les lampes à infrarouge pour accélérer l'évaporation des solvants dans les encres solvantées ou à base d'eau. Elle est souvent utilisée dans les processus d'impression offset et peut être combinée à d'autres méthodes de séchage. # 4. **Systèmes de Séchage Thermique** Particulièrement utilisés pour les encres à base d'eau, ces systèmes chauffent l'ensemble du substrat pour faciliter l'évaporation des composants à base d'eau de l'encre. Ils peuvent utiliser des ventilateurs pour souffler de l'air chaud sur la surface imprimée. # 5. **Séchage par LED UV** Une variante plus récente des systèmes de séchage UV utilise des diodes électroluminescentes (LED) pour émettre la lumière UV nécessaire au durcissement de l'encre. Les sécheurs par LED UV offrent des avantages en termes d'efficacité énergétique, de durée de vie plus longue, et de moindre dégagement de chaleur par rapport aux lampes UV traditionnelles. Ces technologies de séchage ont évolué pour répondre aux divers besoins de l'industrie de l'impression, en optimisant la qualité d'impression, en réduisant les délais de production, et en diminuant l'impact environnemental. Les innovations dans ce domaine continuent d'apporter des améliorations en terme d'efficacité énergétique et de durabilité. # Sources Je m'excuse pour le manque de références directes. Pour plus d'informations détaillées, je recommande de consulter des ressources spécialisées dans l'industrie de l'impression, telles que les sites web des fabricants de machines d'impression et d'encres, ainsi que des revues professionnelles et des publications académiques dans le domaine de la technologie d'impression."},{"instruction":"test","output":"It looks like you're performing a test.

Assuming you're looking for a straightforward back-to-back lineup without specific theme programming or considerations for specific arcs, here's a simple approach to your request: Given the time constraints and the desire to include both series in one marathon, let's alternate between them and start the marathon with *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo*. ------- # Marathon Schedule: **7:00 AM** - *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo* Episode 1 **7:30 AM** - *Naruto* Episode 1 **8:00 AM** - *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo* Episode 2 **8:30 AM** - *Naruto* Episode 2 ... [*Continue this pattern, alternating between the two shows...*] ------- This pattern showcases the two different anime styles and their unique storytelling approaches. Since scheduling involves numerous episodes, we will continue the pattern, assuming a sequence that follows the initial setup. Given this structure, by approximately 6 PM, you would have space for about 22 episodes in total if each episode is approximately 30 minutes with commercials. Thus, for simplicity, I've provided an abstract view of the scheduling pattern. **6:00 PM** - *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo* Episode \\"Ha-le Oo-pu Ah-ah!\\" (This is considered a \\"new\\" episode for the purposes of this marathon, and realistically, the episode's title and placement are creative liberties, as the actual series titles and episode numbers might need to be verified based on where you're planning to insert this new content). **6:30 PM** - *Naruto* \\"Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!\\" (Given as a special episode, although in reality, this is OVA content that could serve as a special event within the marathon, offering fans something slightly out of the regular episode sequence to enjoy). Please note, however, without actual episode counts and titles, the inclusion of \\"Ha-le Oo-pu Ah-ah!\\" is a fictional addition to the *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo* lineup and devised for this schedule. The rest of the marathon, leading up to these specials, should include a balance of both shows, giving fans a day filled with action, humor, and intrigue. Remember, in arranging marathons or special viewing events, it's also important to consider licensing issues, time for commercials if applicable, and audience engagement strategies, such as including interactive elements or commentary during intermissions. This lineup is a simple guide and can be adjusted as needed for time, content, and audience interest."},{"instruction":"These are the results of training a 4 expert transformer with each expert having 128 d-model and 2 heads, 4 encoding layers and 256 dim-feedforward, *results*: Total number of tokens in the dataset: 750 Total trainable parameters: 2487204 Epoch 1, Average Loss: 5.996548 Epoch 2, Average Loss: 5.902823 Epoch 3, Average Loss: 5.824726 Epoch 4, Average Loss: 5.683359 Epoch 5, Average Loss: 5.621686 Epoch 6, Average Loss: 5.567784 Epoch 7, Average Loss: 5.458123 Epoch 8, Average Loss: 5.424160 Epoch 9, Average Loss: 5.348682 Epoch 10, Average Loss: 5.276404 Epoch 11, Average Loss: 5.221392 Epoch 12, Average Loss: 5.187710 Epoch 13, Average Loss: 5.146894 Epoch 14, Average Loss: 5.086936 Epoch 15, Average Loss: 5.079680 Epoch 16, Average Loss: 5.054870 Epoch 17, Average Loss: 4.992655 Epoch 18, Average Loss: 4.977634 Epoch 19, Average Loss: 4.924992 Epoch 20, Average Loss: 4.913226 Accuracy: 0.0990","output":"Based on the results provided for a 4-expert Transformer model, you have described the system and provided the average loss per epoch over 20 epochs, culminating in an accuracy measure at the conclusion. Let's break down and analyze these results from a technical standpoint and consider next steps. # Model Configuration Your model consists of: - 4 expert transformers - Each with a 128 d-model - 2 attention heads - 4 encoding layers - 256 dim-feedforward - Total trainable parameters: 2,487,204 # Training Dynamics The average loss decreases consistently across epochs, starting from 5.996548 in the first epoch to 4.913226 by the 20th epoch. This indicates that the model is learning from the training dataset, as evidenced by the decrease in loss over time. However, a few considerations are essential to delve into: 1. **Learning Rate and Optimization:** The constant decrease in loss suggests that the learning rate and optimization strategy are well-calibrated for this dataset size and model complexity. It would be interesting to understand which optimization algorithm was used (e.g., Adam, SGD) and whether any learning rate schedules were implemented. 2. **Overfitting:** With a relatively small dataset (750 tokens) and a large number of parameters (over 2.4 million), there's a risk of overfitting. Regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay), data augmentation, or gathering more data could help if overfitting becomes an issue, although it's not directly observable from the provided information. # Accuracy The reported accuracy after 20 epochs of training is 0.0990 (or 9.9%). At face value, this seems quite low, suggesting that the model is not performing well at its intended task based on this metric. However, to fully interpret this result, one would need to consider the following aspects: 1. **Task Complexity and Baselines:** The difficulty of the task and the performance of baseline models are critical in evaluating this accuracy. For some highly complex tasks or tasks with a large number of classes, even seemingly low accuracy rates might be significant. 2. **Evaluation Metric Appropriateness:** Is accuracy the best evaluation metric for this task? For instance, tasks with highly unbalanced classes might benefit from looking at precision, recall, F1 score, or other relevant metrics alongside accuracy. 3. **Label Distribution:** In a dataset this small, the distribution of labels/classes is crucial. A highly imbalanced dataset could skew accuracy figures, where the model might learn to predict predominantly the majority class. # Next Steps - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Consider experimenting with different model configurations, learning rates, and optimization strategies. - **Data Augmentation:** If data scarcity is a challenge, techniques to augment the existing dataset could help. - **Advanced Regularization Techniques:** Implement or experiment with different regularization methods to prevent potential overfitting. - **Alternative Metrics:** Evaluate the model using additional metrics that might be more suitable or revealing for the task at hand. - **Model Complexity:** Reflect on whether a simpler model might perform equally well or better given the dataset size. Finally, gaining qualitative insights by inspecting the types of errors the model is making could provide valuable clues for adjustments and improvements."},{"instruction":"Создай пять новых отзывов, о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне На Новохохловской.

Основная цель этого дизайна – улучшить распределение басовых частот в помещении. Вот несколько преимуществ такого расположения динамика: 1. Отражение звука: Звуковые волны от динамика, направленного в пол, отражаются от поверхности пола, что может создать более равномерное распределение баса по всей комнате. 2. Повышение эффективности: Иногда этот способ позволяет добиться более глубокого и мощного баса, так как почва или конструкция пола действует как резонатор и может усилить некоторые частоты. 3. Снижение вибраций: При таком расположении динамика напрямую на пол передается меньше вибраций, что может уменьшать нежелательную резонансную передачу на соседние объекты и помогает избежать \\"размытости\\" баса. 4. Эстетика и универсальность: Down-firing сабвуферы часто выглядят лаконичней и могут быть легче вписаны в интерьер, так как ориентация динамика в пол менее заметна. 5. Труднее заглушить звук: Когда динамик направлен в пол, его труднее случайно или намеренно заблокировать предметами интерьера, что может улучшить производительность сабвуфера.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши в грубом формате. Пиши от первого лица. Используй разные модели автомобилей. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Обещанная рекламой на сайте ставка по кредиту составляла 3 и 5 %. Ниже просто нет, ни в банках, ни у конкурентов. Это и привлекала и настораживало одновременно.И я сказала себе — надо все хорошенько проверить и только потом принимать решение — все таки это ярмо на несколько лет, так пусть хотяб будет ка можно более выгодным. Одобряли после составления и отправления заявки очень и очень долго, несколько часов. Как я понимаю это все так и задумано. Почти перед закрытием, торопясь и поторапливая суют договор и и всячески отвлекают от его чтения. Спецом так делают, чтобы никто не вчитывался в свой не договор уже, а приговор. Нежелание попасться в сомнительную историйка превозмогла усталость. Я твердо и четко глядя прямо в глаза помощнику менеджера потребовала копию всех подсовываемых документов домой, что подписывать не читая я ничего не стану. И вот знаете, что самое интересное, мне никто ничего давать не стал. Сами себя выдали эти проходимцы. То есть подлый расчет на невнимательность обрабатываемого клиента. А честным путем и читать то ничего толком не дадут, даже общаться со здравомыслящим человеком дальше не будут.","output":"1. Приехал в салон на Новохохловской, чтобы посмотреть новенький Toyota Camry. На сайте красивые слова, мол, лучшие условия, подарки первым покупателям, всё как обычно. Приехал, а там начинается цирк. Менеджер явно не в теме, половину вопросов игнорирует, на другую половину отвечает как-то отписываясь. Сказал, хочу взять в кредит, они засветили глазами и тут началось. Сказали, что ставка ниже, чем у других, но когда начали подсовывать бумаги, оказалось, что полно скрытых комиссий. В итоге, кредит выходил на 30% дороже рыночного. Сказал им, спасибо, пошёл на выход. В итоге, честность и прозрачность для них пустой звук. 2. Приглядел себе на сайте салона на Новохохловской красивый Volkswagen Tiguan, акции, скидки, всё как обычно завлекает. Приехал, а там начался настоящий ад. Менеджеры встретили хорошо, но когда дело дошло до подписания документов, такое ощущение, что они со мной играли в кота и мышку. Оказалось, что цена авто на 20% выше, чем было заявлено из-за \\"непредвиденных обстоятельств\\". Хотели ещё и страховку втюхать за обалденные деньги. В итоге, вышел оттуда с пустыми руками. Обман на каждом шагу. 3. Хотел купить Ford Focus в салоне на Новохохловской, но получился полный облом. Обещанные подарки и скидки оказались всего лишь маркетинговым ходом, чтобы заманить клиентов. В реальности всё оказалось не так радужно. Менеджеры давят на психику, пытаясь продать дополнительные услуги, которые я явно не хотел. Сказали, что без дополнительной комплектации авто не продадут. Я был шокирован таким отношением и ушёл ни с чем. 4. Искал Hyundai Sonata, наткнулся на предложение от салона на Новохохловской. Решил заехать и посмотреть. Что самое интересное, когда начал общение с менеджером, то понял, что они вообще не заинтересованы в продаже. Вместо этого начали нагло навязывать мне другую, более дорогую модель, аргументируя это тем, что машина, которую я хотел, вдруг \\"не соответствует моим запросам\\". Я в шоке от такого наглого обмана и жадности. Ушёл и больше не вернусь. 5. В салон на Новохохловской зашёл с целью приобрести новенький Kia Sportage. Всё шло нормально, до тех пор, пока не дело не дошло до оформления. Оказалось, что обещанные условия по кредиту – полная выдумка. Реальная ставка оказалась на порядок выше. К тому же, менеджеры пытались насчитать какие-то абсурдные сборы, о которых речь изначально не шла. Пытался разобраться, но они начали вести себя весьма агрессивно. Забрал свои документы и ушёл. Осталась лишь злость и разочарование от такого \\"сервиса\\"."},{"instruction":"viết một bài văn tiếng việt hoàn chỉnh dài 1000 từ, cụ thể, dẫn chứng rõ ràng với chủ đề Sáng kiến bảo đảm trật tự trường học, Phòng ngừa lao động trẻ em.

Viết về sáng kiến, giải pháp, cách thức phòng ngừa lao động trẻ em, hỗ trợ, can thiệp cho trẻ em có nguy cơ và trẻ em phải lao động trái với quy định của pháp luật và vai trò của các bên liên quan (nhà trường, gia đình, cộng đồng, bản thân trẻ em).","output":"Trong nền kinh tế đổi mới và phát triển như hiện nay, việc đảm bảo trật tự, an ninh trong nhà trường và phòng ngừa lao động trẻ em là hai vấn đề cần được quan tâm hàng đầu. Chúng không chỉ bảo đảm quyền lợi và tương lai của trẻ em mà còn giữ gìn sự ổn định và phát triển bền vững của xã hội. Lao động trẻ em là một hiện tượng nhức nhối, đặt ra nhiều thách thức cho cả cộng đồng, nhà trường và gia đình. Tác hại của lao động trẻ em là sâu rộng và lâu dài, vì vậy tầm quan trọng của giáo dục không thể phủ nhận. Về tác hại của lao động trẻ em, chúng ta không thể bỏ qua những ảnh hưởng xấu đến sức khỏe thể chất lẫn tinh thần. Trẻ em phải đối mặt với nguy cơ tiếp xúc sớm với công việc nặng nhọc, nguy hiểm, không phù hợp với sự phát triển của độ tuổi, gây ảnh hưởng đến tăng trưởng, gián đoạn quá trình học tập, gây ra những hậu quả lâu dài về trí tuệ và sức khỏe. Điều này còn kèm theo nguy cơ bị bạo lực, lạm dụng và lợi dụng. Giáo dục đóng vai trò hết sức quan trọng trong việc giải quyết vấn đề lao động trẻ em. Qua giáo dục, trẻ em được trang bị kiến thức, kỹ năng sống, cơ hội phát triển cá nhân và xã hội, đồng thời tạo nền tảng vững chắc cho tương lai. Bằng việc giáo dục toàn diện, nhà trường và gia đình giúp trẻ nhận thức được tầm quan trọng của việc hoàn thành văn hóa, từ đó, hạn chế tình trạng trẻ phải lao động sớm. Một câu chuyện thực sự có sức lan tỏa và đáng suy ngẫm là trường hợp của em Hà. Em được sinh ra trong một gia đình có hoàn cảnh khó khăn, sống tại một làng quê nghèo. Sớm phải bươn chải kiếm tiền phụ giúp gia đình, Hà đã phải bỏ dở giáo dục từ khi còn rất nhỏ. Tuy vậy, nhờ sự can thiệp kịp thời của các tổ chức xã hội và sự quan tâm của chính quyền địa phương, em đã được giúp đỡ để quay trở lại ghế nhà trường. Hơn thế nữa, những chương trình hỗ trợ đặc biệt đã giúp gia đình Hà có thêm cơ hội phát triển kinh tế, giảm bớt gánh nặng và tạo động lực cho Hà tiếp tục học tập. Câu chuyện của Hà như một minh chứng rõ ràng cho thấy sự hỗ trợ kịp thời có thể thay đổi cuộc đời của trẻ em và giúp họ vươn lên từ hoàn cảnh khó khăn. Về sáng kiến và giải pháp, một cách thức đề xuất đó là xây dựng mạng lưới giám sát cộng đồng, trong đó người dân cùng phối hợp giám sát và báo cáo các trường hợp trẻ em có nguy cơ lao động trẻ em. Nhà trường, thông qua các chương trình giáo dục và hoạt động ngoại khóa, có thể giáo dục học sinh về quyền của trẻ em, từ đó hình thành thái độ không chấp nhận lao động trẻ em trong xã hội. Gia đình nên được tập huấn về cách thức giáo dục con cái không dựa vào lao động của chúng để cải thiện kinh tế gia đình, từ đó giảm bớt tình trạng buộc trẻ em phải lao động sớm. Bên cạnh đó, sự can thiệp từ phía tổ chức xã hội và chính quyền địa phương thông qua việc tạo cơ hội việc làm cho người lớn, cải thiện điều kiện kinh tế cho gia đình có trẻ em nguy cơ cao, tạo điều kiện để các em tiếp tục việc học tập, cũng là những giải pháp quan trọng. Chương trình học bổng, đào tạo nghề, kết hợp giữa làm việc và học tập có thể là những giải pháp phù hợp cho các hộ gia đình đang gặp khó khăn. Vai trò của các bên liên quan là hết sức quan trọng. Nhà trường cần chú trọng đến việc phát hiện và can thiệp sớm đối với trẻ em có nguy cơ cao bị lôi kéo vào lao động. Gia đình nên là cánh tay đắc lực trong việc giám sát và bảo vệ con em mình tránh xa khỏi lao động, khuyến khích các em tập trung vào học tập. Cộng đồng cần có sự đồng lòng trong việc bảo vệ quyền lợi của trẻ em, tạo lập một môi trường an toàn và kích thích tinh thần học tập. Cuối cùng, chính bản thân trẻ em cũng cần ý thức được vai trò học tập và tự bảo vệ mình khỏi các tác động tiêu cực của lao động trẻ em. Trong cuộc chiến chống lao động trẻ em, mọi nguồn lực đều quý giá. Sự phối hợp đồng bộ từ gia đình, nhà trường, cộng đồng và cơ quan chính phủ là mấu chốt để xóa bỏ hoàn toàn nạn lao động trẻ em. Mỗi chúng ta cần nhận thức rõ ràng về trách nhiệm của mình trong việc gìn giữ quyền lợi và tương lai cho thế hệ trẻ - những bảo vệ tốt nhất của tương lai lâu dài cho cả xã hội."},{"instruction":"\\"Hello, I'm seeking inspiration for blog content on our sustainable travel website, which focuses on promoting eco-friendly experiences in the breathtaking landscapes of Costa Rica.

Một trong những điều không thể bỏ qua đó là vấn nạn lao động trẻ em - một hiện tượng không chỉ cướp đi tuổi thơ mà còn là một rào cản lớn trên con đường tiến tới sự phát triển toàn diện của xã hội. Lao động trẻ em không chỉ làm lu mờ nụ cười hồn nhiên của trẻ thơ mà còn gây ra những tác hại nghiêm trọng về thể chất lẫn tinh thần. Trẻ em trong độ tuổi lao động thường phải chịu đựng những công việc nặng nhọc, độc hại, không đảm bảo an toàn, làm suy giảm khả năng phát triển thể chất, ảnh hưởng xấu đến sức khỏe. Hơn nữa, việc bị ngăn cách với ngưỡng cửa giáo dục làm cho họ không thể tiếp cận với kiến thức cần thiết để phát triển tư duy, kiến tạo tương lai và nâng cao dân trí. Điều này không chỉ làm ảnh hưởng đến bản thân những đứa trẻ mà còn làm gia tăng sự chênh lệch văn hóa, kinh tế giữa các tầng lớp trong xã hội, góp phần phá vỡ sự cân bằng cần thiết để xã hội phát triển lành mạnh. Câu chuyện của cậu bé Minh, một trường hợp điển hình cho lao động trẻ em, nhưng rồi được giải cứu và quay trở lại trường học, là một minh chứng rõ ràng cho tác động tích cực của việc can thiệp giáo dục kịp thời. Minh lọt vào vòng xoáy lao động từ rất sớm để phụ giúp gia đình, khi mà lẽ ra cậu phải đến trường. Bàn tay nhỏ bé của cậu thường xuyên bị chai sạn vì nghề gọt dừa, thay vì cầm bút viết bài. Nhưng rồi, qua sự vào cuộc của một tổ chức phi chính phủ và sự hỗ trợ của cộng đồng, Minh đã được đưa trở lại mái trường, nơi cậu có cơ hội phát triển khả năng cá nhân và tái hiện những giấc mơ tuổi thơ. Sự thay đổi trong hoàn cảnh của Minh không chỉ là một chiến công cá nhân, mà còn là một phần của sáng kiến chung cả xã hội trong việc bảo vệ và giáo dục trẻ em. Sáng kiến này bắt đầu từ việc nâng cao nhận thức về quyền lợi của trẻ em, khuyến khích việc đi học và tuyên truyền rộng rãi về các tác hại của lao động trẻ em. Cùng với đó, việc hỗ trợ học bổng, triển khai các chương trình bảo trợ, hoặc tạo điều kiện cho việc học tập thông qua các cơ sở vật chất giáo dục cải tiến, là những bước đi quan trọng trong hành trình này. Bên cạnh đó, nhà trường và gia đình cần phối hợp chặt chẽ trong việc quản lý, theo dõi tình trạng của học sinh. Các giáo viên không chỉ nhắc nhở, hỗ trợ học sinh trong học tập, mà còn phải tham gia vào quy trình phát hiện và can thiệp khi thấy trẻ em có dấu hiệu của lao động trẻ em. Rèn luyện kỹ năng sống, tạo điều kiện để trẻ em thể hiện bản thân và phát triển sở thích cũng là một phần không thể thiếu trong quá trình giáo dục toàn diện. Gia đình, với vai trò là cell xã hội đầu tiên, cần tạo điều kiện tốt nhất để trẻ em tham gia giáo dục. Bố mẹ, người thân cần phải thấu hiểu giá trị của học vấn và không gây áp lực hay buộc trẻ tham gia lao động để giúp đỡ kinh tế gia đình. Việc làm này không chỉ vi phạm pháp luật mà còn gây ra hậu quả lâu dài đối với sự phát triển của trẻ. Cộng đồng lại là bức tường vững chãi hỗ trợ, lan tỏa thông điệp và tạo lập môi trường thuận lợi cho việc học hành và nâng cao dân trí. Những tổ chức phi chính phủ, đoàn thể, có thể phát động các chiến dịch nhằm cung cấp thông tin, đơn giản hóa quy trình cứu trợ và hỗ trợ trẻ em nghèo vượt qua khó khăn để tiếp tục giáo dục. Cuối cùng, không thể bỏ qua vai trò của chính bản thân những trẻ em trong việc ngăn chặn lao động trẻ em. Họ cần được trang bị kiến thức về quyền lợi và nghĩa vụ của mình, được học cách tự bảo vệ và khi cần thiết, tìm kiếm sự giúp đỡ từ người lớn. Trẻ em cần được khuyến khích phản kháng lại những tình huống bất công, và từ đó xây dựng nền tảng cho một thế hệ mới có nhận thức rõ ràng về quyền làm chủ cuộc sống của mình. Tóm lại, sáng kiến bảo đảm trật tự trường học và phòng ngừa lao động trẻ em không chỉ cần sự vào cuộc của một mình nhà trường, gia đình, cộng đồng hay chính phủ, mà còn cần sự nổ lực của từng cá nhân trẻ em. Mỗi người từ những hành động nhỏ bé nhưng đầy ý nghĩa, cùng nhau vun đắp cho một tương lai không còn nỗi lo về lao động trẻ em, xây dựng một xã hội văn minh, công bằng và thịnh vượng."},{"instruction":"\\"The Prompt: \\"\\"Suggest subheadings for [how to get confidence in basketball, 3 on 3 basketball plays, confidence drills, confidence in basketball] that include related secondary keywords.\\"\\" Example Output: A set of H1, H2 and H3 tags designed to enhance on-page SEO and readability.

If you wish to bind your Expert Advisor (EA) to a specific demo account in MQL5, you can achieve this by checking the account number and ensuring the EA only operates if it matches your specified demo account number. Additionally, it's common to check whether the account is indeed a demo, as you wouldn't want your restriction to mistakenly apply to a live account. Here's an example snippet you can add to the bottom of your EA's source code. This snippet will check both whether the account is a demo and if it matches the specified demo account number. If the conditions are not met, the EA will cease its operation by simply not executing any further trades or operations. Please note, to integrate this effectively, you should ensure that this check is performed before any trading actions are initiated. Depending on the structure of your EA, this might mean placing the check at the beginning of the \`OnTick()\` function or whichever function is responsible for initiating trades. \`\`\`mql5 // Define your demo account number here const long DEMO_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = 12345678; // Change this to your actual demo account number // Function to check if the account is a demo bool IsDemoAccount() { // Check if the terminal is running on a demo account return(AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE) == TRADE_MODE_DEMO); } // Function to check if running on the specified demo account bool IsSpecifiedDemoAccount() { return (AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_LOGIN) == DEMO_ACCOUNT_NUMBER); } // Main function to check account restrictions void CheckAccountRestrictions() { if (!IsDemoAccount() || !IsSpecifiedDemoAccount()) { Print(\\"This EA is bound to a specific demo account and cannot run.\\"); ExpertRemove(); // Stop the EA } else { // Account checks passed, you can proceed with operations Print(\\"Running on the specified demo account.\\"); } } // Example of usage at the beginning of the OnTick function void OnTick() { // Check the account restrictions before proceeding CheckAccountRestrictions(); // The rest of your trading logic goes here } \`\`\` You would need to replace \`DEMO_ACCOUNT_NUMBER\` with the actual demo account number you want to bind your EA to. The \`CheckAccountRestrictions\` function conducts two checks: one to verify that the account is a demo and another to assert that the account number matches your specified number. If any of these conditions aren't met, the EA will print a message and then disable itself using the \`ExpertRemove()\` function. Remember, the actual binding and security measures for EAs can be more complex and might involve checking other conditions or using external systems for validation, especially for live account usage. This example focuses on a basic demo account binding scenario as per your request."},{"instruction":"может ли существовать имя bone crusher","output":"Да, имя \\"Bone Crusher\\" может существовать как художественный псевдоним или сценическое имя для артиста, спортсмена или персонажа.

Since the repeating part is two digits long (25), we can eliminate it by subtracting a shifted version of x from itself. First, let's multiply x by 100 to shift the decimal two places to the right: 100x = 325.252525... Now let's subtract the original value of x from this to get rid of the repeating part: 100x - x = 325.252525... - 3.252525... 99x = 322 Now, solve for x: x = 322 / 99 So the fraction representation of the decimal 3.252525... is 322/99. If you would like this in simplest form, both 322 and 99 can be divided by 1: 322 ÷ 1 = 322 99 ÷ 1 = 99 So you are already at the simplest form, and the fraction is 322/99."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],F={key:0},O={key:1};function z(n,e,d,m,o,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(i(!0),a(v,null,b(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
