In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that:  \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev.

Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the spring of 1941, Al Woods quits an Oklahoma college to join the armed forces after a quarrel with his co-ed sweetheart, Jo. He joins the Coast Guard, partly by chance due to the flip of a coin. After boot training, Al is assigned to a buoy tender in Boston, the Periwinkle, as a ship's cook although he has no cooking experience. He encounters immediate hostility from the chief of the galley, Red Wildoe, from new crew mates and cooks' helpers Gutsell and Poznicki, and from his arrogant department head, Lieutenant (junior grade) Higgins. In a Boston bar, Al picks up Stella, who appears to do this kind of thing with some regularity. They develop a strong attraction, but she seems to be holding out for something more.[3] He befriends Gutsell by fixing him up with a girlfriend of Stella's and learns from Wildoe how to be a ship's cook, making a number of embarrassing mistakes. Al, frustrated after Stella won't spend a night in a hotel room with him, stops seeing her, whereupon he and the alcoholic Wildoe get drunk together and bond. Wildoe begins seeing Stella with Al's blessing. Pearl Harbor is attacked and war declared. Wildoe abruptly proposes to Stella and they marry. A free-for-all breaks out at their wedding celebration, with a jealous Al instigating a fight with soldiers who are clearly familiar with Stella already. Wildoe is assigned to another vessel performing convoy duty at sea. During this time, Stella begins seeing other men. Al tries to prevent this on Wildoe's behalf, but can't resist Stella himself. Aboard the Periwinkle, Al becomes the new chief cook. Higgins, promoted to executive officer, is discovered entering lesser amounts than they pay for the cost of officers' meals into the ledger of the ship's mess and pocketing the difference.

OPT: [a]. memory; [b]. the theme of listening material; [c]. a branch of knowledge studied; [d]. the student experimented on; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate  , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory. Question: The word \\"subject\\" in the passage means   _  . Answer: A:","output":"a branch of knowledge studied; In this passage, the word \\"subject\\" refers to the college students who participated in Henning's experiment on short-term memory.

Question 2: What can having a sore throat with cough and ear pain mean? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer both questions, I'm going to gather information about the symptoms and causes of ear pain while swallowing, sore throat, cough, and their possible connections. Step 1: Identify the symptoms Symptoms mentioned in the questions include: - Ear pain while swallowing - Sore throat - Cough Step 2: Research causes of these symptoms - Ear pain while swallowing: This can be caused by a middle ear infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, or inflammation in the throat, which is connected to the ear via Eustachian tubes. - Sore throat: Common causes include viral infections (like the common cold or the flu), bacterial infections (like strep throat), or irritation due to environmental factors. - Cough: Coughs can be caused by several factors, including cold, flu, allergies, bronchitis, and infections in the upper respiratory tract. Step 3: Identify possible connections Both ear pain while swallowing and sore throat can be symptoms of a common cold or flu, or they can result from infections or inflammation in the throat or ears. A cough can also be a symptom of a cold, flu, or upper respiratory tract infection. It is important to note that these symptoms might have different causes and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Question 1 answer: Ear pain while swallowing with a sore throat can be caused by middle ear infections, eustachian tube dysfunction, or inflammation in the throat. Question 2 answer: Having a sore throat with cough and ear pain can mean the person is experiencing symptoms of a common cold, flu, or an infection in the upper respiratory tract. It might also indicate a separate issue with the ear or throat that may or may not be related to the cough and sore throat. Now, let's compare the two questions: Question 1 focuses on the cause of ear pain while swallowing with a sore throat. Question 2 aims to understand the meaning behind the combination of symptoms: sore throat, cough, and ear pain. Both questions address similar issues, but they are not the same. Question 1 is more specific in examining the cause of ear pain while swallowing, while Question 2 encompasses more symptoms and looks to find a broader meaning for the combination of symptoms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you communicate with your horse, it is important to remain calm. If you don’t come in knowing what you want to do, you will likely fall back on feelings and instincts. This will make you more likely to panic or overreact to a horse’s actions, rather than remaining calm and in control. When you come near a horse, you want to make sure he is willing to talk to you. If the horse wants to talk to you, he will turn his head or front toward your, lick his lips, and soften his eyes. Once you get this signal, you can approach the horse slowly and start communicating further. Your horse may do the opposite, turning his head away from you, walking away, or even ignoring you. If the horse isn’t interested in letting you in, he won’t be responsive to what you say. Horses have monocular vision, meaning they can’t see directly in front of their noses. Make sure you walk toward a horse from the side so he can see you clearly. Never approach a horse from behind. Horses can’t see in that direction, and you are at risk of getting kicked if they get spooked. Make sure your horse recognizes that you are the leader of his herd. If he doesn’t recognize you that way, he won’t listen to what you are saying. If your horse doesn’t seem to be showing proper respect, make him move his feet. Pushing on his shoulder or hip should do well on most occasions. If you need a little more power, you can poke him with the handle end of a crop. Just make sure you stand in the same place when you do this, and don’t shuffle your feet. A horse that doesn’t respect you will rub his head on you, nip to get your attention, or walk in front of you when you are trying to lead him. These are not behaviors he would show to a dominant leader of his herd. Horses are prey animals, meaning that in the wild they are hunted by others, and your horse considers you a predator. This means he will consider any outsider to be a threat, including you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ethan Liptonâs âNo Place to Go,â at Joeâs Pub Ethan Lipton, a wry singer-songwriter whose heavy-lidded affability and retro facial hair make him look like a doomed sidekick in a ’70s cop movie, grinned upon learning that one collaborator after another had independently used the word Everyman to describe him. “Here, and I thought I was fancy,” he said. For nearly four weeks, beginning on Wednesday, audiences at Joe’s Pub can decide for themselves. There Mr. Lipton will meld his three professional personas — troubadour, playwright and permalance office drone — into “No Place to Go,” which converts the current economic malaise into a chipper-despite-it-all song cycle that Woody Guthrie and Ben Folds might both embrace. “No Place to Go,” directed by Leigh Silverman, features Mr. Lipton and his three-piece band in a somewhat staged production that hews very closely to its creator’s recent experiences. Like his unnamed protagonist, Mr. Lipton, 41, pays his rent predominantly through freelance jobs in publishing. (He describes himself in the show as an “information refiner.”) In both cases, the issue of relocating to keep your job arises when an employer decides to leave New York, although only the onstage Mr. Lipton is faced with a relocation to Mars, where “the real estate is, like, a penny a hectare.” Looming over “No Place” is the broader issue of how to be an artist when “we are all now, on this planet, accountable to the shareholders.” Mr. Lipton, who experienced the unhip phenomenon of actually liking his day job, chose to stay put. Luckily, Joe’s Pub came calling with a commission, thanks to a National Endowment for the Arts grant to develop pieces with “musicians who had strong narrative in their work,” according to Shanta Thake, the club’s director. Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater in the East Village, chose five musicians with a connection to the club; the others were Angelique Kidjo, Allen Toussaint, Toshi Reagon and Lady Rizo. Their pieces are at various stages of development, Ms. Thake said, and Joe’s Pub has no firm plans to produce them. Mr. Lipton was a particularly apt choice, as he had also participated in the Public’s Emerging Writers Group, where he had collaborated with Ms. Silverman, a popular Off Broadway director whose Broadway ventures include “Chinglish” and “Well.” He had already been considering some sort of project along these lines; there’s a Post-it Note kicking around from a few months back on which he had written “Musical about losing my job (or album).” But the commission allowed him to conjoin two realms that had thus far been segregated: his music and his plays, which have been performed at Here Arts Center in the South Village and as part of Clubbed Thumb’s Summerworks festival. “I had toyed with the idea of doing things like this before,” said Mr. Lipton, who has also dabbled in acting. (He was in the original cast of Elevator Repair Service’s celebrated play “Gatz,” which returns to the Public the same night as “No Place to Go” begins performances.) “But playwriting is such a willful act, whereas songwriting is kind of an escape from that. Each gives me a bit of protection from the other.” Ms. Silverman said this combination was a long time coming. “People leave his shows whipped into this sort of ecstasy” by the music and by his quirky way of delivering it, she said. Mr. Lipton’s music is sort of a sliced-and-diced Great American Songbook. “The thing we lean back into is a kind of jazz-folk-Americana idiom,” Mr. Lipton said of his band, known as Ethan Lipton and His Orchestra, “but we also try to push forward into something that sounds contemporary lyrically and also isn’t too dinosaury sound-wise.” And so “No Place to Go” features a jaunty tribute to the New Deal-era’s job-creation effort, the W.P.A., but also pokes fun at the working man’s propensity to, when facing financial ruin, “make another macho move in Scrabble” and “see if there’s anything about it on The Huffington Post.” Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public, played a central role in shepherding “No Place” into production less than a year after it was commissioned, partly because it was so topical and partly because Mr. Lipton’s outlook runs counter to most topical fare. “That modest, offhand, slightly wry way Ethan looks at himself and the world around him is a wonderful antidote to the partisan hysteria — and I say this as a partisan hysteric — about anything political, and especially anything economic, today,” Mr. Eustis said. Modest, offhand, wry: These are not words you typically use when describing a bandleader. (Matt Berninger, the lead singer of the rock band the National and another longtime fan, threw “subtle” and “charming” into the mix.) “Like most artists — like most people, I guess — I started out when I was younger, trying to figure out what was special or different or original,” Mr. Lipton said. “And at some point I realized it was more interesting to me — and a bigger challenge — to try to look at what’s the same, or what’s common about our experiences. “I’m a grown-up,” he continued. “I’ve been working. And I and the people I know have mostly managed to do that with dignity. And it’s not because we’re mature or good people. It’s because we’ve got to work.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Ethan Lipton is a singer-songwriter who has a show called \\"No Place to Go\\" at Joe's Pub. In the show, he combines his experiences as a musician, playwright, and freelancer. The show is about the challenges of being an artist and working in the modern economy. People say Ethan's music is a unique blend of jazz, folk, Americana, and contemporary lyrics. The show is funny and relatable, and people enjoy his modest and wry way of looking at the world."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Onde poderia o rosebush ter sido localizado?   Options: A jardim botânico B no solo C campo D natureza E quintal do vizinho  A:","output":"Part #1: Question in Portuguese language. Usage: \\"Joe corria à volta da sua casa e atravessava um limite de propriedade, correndo para um roseiral meticulosamente manejado e causando danos tanto a ele como a si próprio.\\" This part of the definition states that the question will be presented in Portuguese. This example meets the criteria because it is written in Portuguese. Part #2: Multiple possible answers in Portuguese language. Usage: \\"A jardim botânico B no solo C campo D natureza E quintal do vizinho\\" This part of the definition explains that there will be multiple possible answers, also in Portuguese. This example meets the criteria because it provides five different options in Portuguese. Part #3: Choose the most suitable option. Usage: \\"E quintal do vizinho\\" In this example, the answer would be \\"E quintal do vizinho\\" because it makes the most sense based on the information given in the question. Joe crossed the property boundary and caused damage to a well-maintained rosebush, which would be most likely found in a neighbor's yard. Thus, this response meets the criteria as it selects the most suitable answer from the options given. Part #4: Use commonsense knowledge. Usage: As mentioned earlier, the answer \\"E quintal do vizinho\\" would be chosen based on commonsense knowledge that a well-maintained rosebush could likely be found in a neighbor's yard when considering Joe's actions. This part of the definition emphasizes using general knowledge to arrive at the correct answer, and this example meets that requirement because the chosen answer logically fits the information given in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Passage:Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the British Empire, the new Rhodesian authorities started to crack down on African liberation movements. One of their considerations was to ban performance of \\"Ishe Komborera Africa\\" in African schools and public performance of it often made people liable for arrest by the British South African Police. The District Commissioner for Gutu abolished the Gutu African Council after its leader opened a meeting by singing \\"Ishe Komborera Africa\\" in the District Commissioner's presence. The Commissioner also had the leader arrested but he was released without charge. Following the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980, after Zimbabwe Rhodesia returned to British control as Southern Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party won to become the first government of an independent Zimbabwe. After this, \\"Ishe Komborera Africa\\" was selected to replace the official \\"God Save the Queen\\" of Southern Rhodesia and the unofficial \\"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\\" of Rhodesia as the national anthem of an independent Zimbabwe as it was a symbol of black African struggles and solidarity against apartheid systems in South Africa and Namibia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. When his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the Wilber Sweatman Orchestra in New York City, Ellington made the fateful decision to leave behind his successful career in Washington, D.C., and move to Harlem, ultimately becoming part of the Harlem Renaissance. New dance crazes such as the Charleston emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American musical theater, including Eubie Blake's Shuffle Along. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive and hard to crack. They hustled pool by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at rent-house parties for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.  In June 1923, a gig in Atlantic City, New Jersey, led to a play date at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club - 49th and Broadway - and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter James \\"Bubber\\" Miley. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club).  Ellington made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \\"Choo Choo\\". In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to Chocolate Kiddies starring Lottie Gee and Adelaide Hall, an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington's arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and sultry saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet played with them, imparting his propulsive swing and superior musicianship to the young band members.

The military services are poised to allow women to serve in most front-line combat jobs, including special operations forces, senior officials told The Associated Press.      RETRANSMISSION TO REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO THE ARMY RANGERS. THESE WOMEN ARE NOT TRAINING IN THE RANGERS PROGRAM - FILE - In this Aug. 13, 2013 file photo, U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms Third Class Danielle... (Associated Press)      Based on early talks, officials say the Army, Navy and Air Force likely will not seek exceptions that close any jobs to women. Marine Corps leaders, they say, have expressed concerns about allowing women to serve in infantry jobs and yet may seek an exception.      The services are wrapping up reviews and must make their recommendations to Defense Secretary Ash Carter this fall. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal debate.      Even if Marine leaders object, they are likely to meet resistance from senior Navy and Defense Department officials who want the military to be united on this issue.      Undercutting the Marines' reservations is that Special Operations Command is likely to allow women to compete for the most demanding military commando jobs — including the Navy SEALs and the Army's Delta Force — though with the knowledge that it may be years before women even try to enter those fields.      Women have been steadily moving into previously all-male jobs across the military, including as members of the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, best known as the helicopter crews that flew Navy SEALs into Osama bin Laden's compound. Women are also now serving on Navy submarines and in Army artillery units.      Friday will mark another milestone as the two women graduate at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the Ranger school, a physically and mentally demanding two-month combat leadership course. Completing the course lets the two women wear the coveted Ranger black-and-gold tab, but it does not let them become members of the Ranger regiment. Neither woman has been publicly identified by the military.      Longer term, the uncertainty of the Marine decision underscores the wrenching debates going on within the military over the changing role of women, and it reflects the individual identities of the services and how they view their warrior ethos.      Only a handful of jobs in the Navy and Air Force are currently closed to women.      Last year the Navy considered seeking an exception that would have prohibited women from serving on older guided missile frigates, mine-countermeasure ships and patrol coast craft. Some argued that those ships, which are due to be phased out in coming years, would need millions of dollars in construction to add facilities for women and it wasn't worth the expense.      But Navy Secretary Ray Mabus withdrew that plan in a memo late last month that was obtained by the AP. Officials said Navy leaders concluded that since women can serve in all the same jobs on other ships no real exclusion existed.      The Army and Marine Corps, however, have thousands of infantry, artillery and armor jobs that are currently closed to women. There has been a lot of study and debate over whether to open those positions, because they often involve fighting in small units on the front lines, doing physically punishing tasks.      The Marine Corps set up a task force this year to set gender-neutral job standards and determine whether incorporating women into small squads affected unit cohesion or combat readiness. Companies made up of all men and mixes of men and women spent up to three months in California performing a broad range of unit tasks and going through detailed scientific evaluations to see how they did. Senior leaders are reviewing those results.      Army leaders did similar scientific analysis, reviewing all tasks needed to do the combat jobs and have been creating gender-neutral standards that troops will have to meet in order to qualify. Meanwhile, however, the Army began to slowly open some combat positions, including artillery jobs, to women.      In recent days, officials familiar with the discussions said they believe the Army will allow women to seek infantry and armor jobs as well.      Gen. Ray Odierno, who retired last week as Army chief of staff, hinted at that conclusion.      \\"In order to best manage your talent, you have to pick the best people who can perform to the standards that we have established,\\" Odierno said. \\"If you can meet the standards that we've established, then you should be able to perform in that (position). And I think that's where we're headed.\\"      In January 2013 then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey signed an order wiping away generations of limits on women fighting for their country, ordering a quarter-million positions open regardless of gender. They called for sweeping reviews of the physical requirements for combat jobs and gave the military services until January 2016 to argue if any positions should remain closed to women.      Throughout the process, all the services have made it clear they will not reduce any standards to allow women to qualify for the most demanding jobs. But they reviewed the requirements for the various combat posts to make sure they were directly related to tasks that had to be done as part of the jobs.      During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, thousands of women served and fought, and about 160 died.      Dempsey told reporters during that 2013 news conference that he did not rule out women serving as members of special operations forces, although it might be years before they actually qualified.      \\"I think we all believe that there will be women who can meet those standards,\\" he said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This article talks about how women are allowed to do more jobs in the military. There were some jobs that only men could do before, but now women can do them too. Some examples are being part of the Army Rangers, flying helicopters, and working on submarines. There is still some disagreement about whether women should do certain jobs, like being in the infantry, but many people think that as long as they can do the tasks required for the job, women should be allowed to do those jobs too.

Article: For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \\"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\\" and that they would accelerate \\"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" Question: We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph    _   .

Should I validate this answer?   + No  + Yes The answer is:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question of how Apollo Creed died. While it is correct that Apollo Creed is a fictional character from the Rocky films and was initially portrayed as the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World, the answer does not provide information about his death. Apollo Creed, played by actor Carl Weathers, first appeared in the 1976 film \\"Rocky\\" as the reigning Heavyweight Champion who ends up in a close and grueling fight with the protagonist, Rocky Balboa. Over the course of the series, Apollo and Rocky develop a deep friendship and mutual respect, with Apollo even becoming a mentor to Rocky in later films. Apollo Creed's death occurred in the fourth installment of the series, \\"Rocky IV,\\" which was released in 1985. In the film, a formidable and seemingly invincible Russian boxer named Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lundgren) challenges American fighters to prove the superiority of the Soviet Union's sports program. Apollo Creed, seeking to regain his glory days and defend his country's honor, accepts the challenge and sets up an exhibition match against the formidable Drago. The match takes place and quickly turns out to be a monumental mismatch. Despite Rocky's pleas to call off the fight, a determined Apollo insists on continuing, but the overpowered Drago ultimately lands a lethal punch. Apollo collapses to the canvas, suffering severe internal and brain injuries, and tragically dies in Rocky's arms in the ring. Apollo Creed's death serves as a significant plot point in the \\"Rocky\\" series, as it sets the stage for Rocky to seek revenge against Drago and restore his friend's honor by defeating him in a subsequent match. As a result, Apollo's death remains etched in the memory of \\"Rocky\\" fans as a grievous loss and a critical turning point in the story arc."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Since the constant term is positive, we will subtract 55 from both sides to keep the equation balanced. -16 = 71*t + 55 -16 - 55 = 71*t + 55 - 55 This simplifies to: -71 = 71*t Step 2: Solve for the variable t. Now, we need to isolate t by dividing both sides of the equation by 71. This will help us find the value of t. -71 = 71*t -71 / 71 = (71*t) / 71 This simplifies to: -1 = t So, the value of t that solves the equation -16 = 71*t + 55 is: t = -1"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Additionally, they will bring up concerns regarding human rights and political freedoms in Cuba. During the meeting, Cuban officials are expected to present their perspective on the current political climate, economic reforms underway, and their commitment to improving relations with the United States.

Additionally, I will test the pH level of the soil, targeting a slightly acidic to neutral pH range of 6.0-7.0 for optimal squash growth. Step 4: Plant the seeds or seedlings Based on my research, I will decide whether to plant seeds or seedlings. If planting seeds, I will sow the seeds about 1 inch deep and 3 feet apart in rows or hills (mounds of soil), depending on my garden layout. If planting seedlings, I will transplant them carefully, keeping the same spacing as recommended for seeds. Step 5: Water and care for the plants During the initial stages of plant growth, I will provide consistent moisture, watering about 1-1.5 inches per week, depending on rainfall and weather conditions. As the plants grow, I will also monitor them for disease and pests and take appropriate measures to protect my plants. Step 6: Fertilize as needed Although squash plants benefit from the compost mixed into the soil, additional fertilizer may be necessary, especially if the soil is lacking in nutrients. Following the recommended rates, I will apply an all-purpose organic fertilizer during the growing season to ensure my plants have adequate nourishment. Step 7: Harvest at the right time The final step in the process is harvesting my squash at the right time. Depending on the variety, squash plants can take anywhere from 40-100 days to reach maturity. I will monitor my plants for signs of ripeness, such as a developed color, firm skin, and ideal size, before harvesting and enjoying my homegrown squash."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This implies that the sick person is experiencing symptoms and is not receiving medical care or intervention. Step 2: Evaluate the options a) Get better: While some sick individuals may eventually recover without intervention, this option does not address the active symptoms a person may experience. b) Train: It is unlikely that a sick person would engage in physical training, as their energy levels and physical ability could be compromised due to the illness. c) Battle cancer: This option is too specific to one illness and does not apply to all sick persons. d) Throw up: This option reflects a common symptom experienced by sick individuals, regardless of the specific illness. e) Take medicine: This option is counter to the premise of the question, as taking medicine would count as a form of treatment. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the analysis of the options, \\"throw up\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question because it accurately reflects a common symptom experienced by sick persons when they are not receiving treatment.

The author demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of reciprocity – a principle that is central to many moral and ethical systems. 'Give more take less' communicates a philosophy of generosity, selflessness, and a focus on contributing to others or the world more than we take from it; it suggests opting for altruism over personal gain. Given its comparison with 'the wildest of jungles,' this sentiment is accentuated. Jungles often symbolize chaos, struggle for survival, and unpredictability in popular culture. When the author suggests this principle applies effectively even in such challenging circumstances, they underline the timelessness and universal nature of the principle. It's their belief that even in the most adverse situations, a spirit of giving and general benevolence can prevail. The choice of informal language ('Wad up Homie') following such a profound statement can indicate a couple of things. Firstly, it could mean the author does not take themselves too seriously, even while discussing serious philosophical principles. It can also mean that despite holding such principles in high esteem, the author believes in making them accessible and relatable, avoiding overly formal or academic language. Overall, this tweet's sentiment underscores a strong sense of morality grounded in selflessness, implications of universal applicability, all wrapped in colloquial and accessible language. The juxtaposition of deep, meaningful philosophy with conversational, 'street' language could be aimed at reaching a broader demographic, bringing philosophical life advice into everyday discussion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) was set up to deal with toxic loans after the 2008 property crash. Cerberus bought Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio for £1.3bn in 2014. The Republic of Ireland's auditor general has concluded that there were shortcomings in the sale process, costing taxpayers up to £190m. Cerberus has always maintained that its part in that process was \\"conducted with full integrity\\". Cerberus declined to give oral evidence to a Stormont inquiry, citing a a variety of legal reasons; however it did give written evidence. Cerberus does big deals but is not a outfit which welcomes big headlines. In 2008, when it had a high profile involvement with the Chrysler car company, it wrote to investors apologising, saying: \\"We despise all the public attention we are getting.\\" The firm's founder, Stephen Feinberg, reportedly joked that if anyone at Cerberus gets their picture in the paper, \\"we will do more than fire that person - we will kill him.\\" So it's significant that the fund is wheeling out one of its top team to deal with the Nama issue - a story which has now been running for more than a year. Mr Neporent is likely to face questions about the Cerberus relationship with two law firms - Brown Rudnick and Tughans. The firms had been representing another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio. Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor. Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms \\"a success fee only basis\\", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done. Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans. Cerberus said it received \\"express confirmation\\" from both firms that no fee or commission was payable to any current or former Nama advisors.

Stenkil probably originated from Västergötland.  - Emund the Old or Edmund (Swedish: \\"Emund den gamle\\", Old Swedish: \\"Æmunðær gamlæ\\", \\"Æmunðær gammal\\", \\"Æmunðær slemæ\\") was King of Sweden from 1050 to 1060.   - Uppsala (older spelling \\"Upsala\\") is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth largest city of Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. It had 140,454 inhabitants in 2010.  - Halsten Stenkilsson , English exonym : Alstan ( Old Icelandic : Hallstein ) was a king of Sweden , son of King Stenkil and a Swedish princess . He became king after his father Stenkil 's death ( 1066 ) , and he may have ruled together with his brother Inge the Elder . The date of his death is not known . Little is known of his time as king . In a scholia in the work of Adam of Bremen , he is reported to have been elected king after the death of two pretenders , but deposed after a short while . That he ruled together with his brother Inge has some support from a papal letter from 1081 , by Pope Gregory VII , which refers to two kings with the initials A and I , and where they are called kings of Västergötland ( rege wisigothorum ) . However , the king \`\` A '' could also be Håkan the Red . His co-rulership with his brother Inge is also mentioned in the Hervarar saga . In the regnal list of the Westrogothic law , he is said to have been courteous and cheerful , and whenever a case was submitted to him , he judged fairly , and this was why Sweden mourned his death . He was the father of the co-rulers Philip and Inge the Younger . The Hervarar saga , which is one of the few sources about the kings of this time , has the following to tell :  - Stenkil (Old Norse: Steinkell) was a King of Sweden who ruled c. 1060 until 1066. He succeeded Emund the Old and became the first king from the House of Stenkil. He was not from Uppsala, but probably from Västergötland and related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund's daughter.  - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden.    What is the relationship between 'halsten stenkilsson' and '1050'? A:","output":"Halsten Stenkilsson was a king of Sweden and the son of King Stenkil, who ruled from around 1060 to 1066. Halsten's relationship to the year '1050' is that his father Stenkil succeeded Emund the Old, who was the King of Sweden from 1050 to 1060.

If your comic is in flawless or nearly flawless condition, it might merit a grade of \\"mint\\" or \\"near mint.\\" This condition applies to perfectly flat comics with supple paper, a glossy cover, and no obvious wear.  \\"Mint\\" grades include \\"Perfect/Gem Mint\\" (10.0) and \\"Mint\\" (9.9). These describe comics that have no detectable imperfections. A 10.0 book is absolutely perfect in every way. Very few comics meet this criteria, even those still sitting on the shelves in a comic store.  \\"Near Mint+/Mint\\" grades include \\"Near Mint/Mint\\" (9.8) and \\"Near Mint+\\" (9.6). These grades describe comics that have only the slightest wear. A small number of stress lines and very slight discoloration are acceptable defects. Most people would consider these to be perfect, but the trained eye may notice tiny imperfections. \\"Near Mint\\" (9.4) and \\"Near Mint-\\" (9.2) describe comics that have minimal stress lines and discoloration. The spine and cover are flat. The cover may have a small amount of surface wear, but the colors are still bright. A 9.4 Near Mint book is the standard condition of a new book sold at a comic store as is considered \\"new\\" condition. A 9.2 indicates only the very minor wear, typically a minimal stress mark on the spine (non-color breaking) or other similar marks. A comic which is well preserved but not \\"mint\\" is typically described as \\"Fine\\" or \\"Very Fine.\\" These are comics that have been read and enjoyed, but with care. They may have some discoloration, but pages should still be supple and the cover should still be glossy and attractive.  \\"Very Fine/Near Mint\\" (9.0), \\"Very Fine+\\" (8.5), \\"Very Fine\\" (8.0), and \\"Very Fine-\\" (7.5) are grades that allow for some wear, as they have typically been read a few times. A few stress lines are acceptable. While the cover can have some wear, it should still retain its original glossiness. \\"Fine\\" grades include \\"Fine/Very Fine\\" (7.0), \\"Fine+\\" (6.5), \\"Fine\\" (6.0), and \\"Fine-\\" (5.5). These grades describe comics with a fair amount of stress lines and creases. A low number of small tears and missing pieces, usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch (about 3.1 to 6.3 mm) in length is also acceptable at this grade level. Below \\"Fine\\" is the grade of \\"Good.\\" This is somewhat deceptive, as a grade of \\"good\\" is actually not particularly good, but more like average. These are comics that have been well-loved by a reader. Still, books in this condition must be intact and readable.  \\"Very Good\\" grades include \\"Very Good/Fine\\" (5.0), \\"Very Good+\\" (4.5), \\"Very Good\\" (4.0), and \\"Very Good-\\" (3.5). These grades describe a comic that has all of its pages but is noticeably creased, rolled, and scuffed. Missing pieces on the cover can be as large as 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about 6.3 to 12.5 mm). \\"Good\\" grades include \\"Good/Very Good\\" (3.0), \\"Good+\\" (2.5), \\"Good\\" (2.0), and \\"Good-\\" (1.8). These grades describe comics that are in somewhat worse condition than the \\"Very Good\\" grades. The cover may have some missing pieces and the book is generally scuffed, abraded, and faded. Moderate spine split is permissible. The comic still has all of its pages, however. A \\"Fair\\" condition comic is ragged and unattractive. It may have pieces of pages missing that make the story more difficult to follow (e.g. clipped coupons that cut into panels on the reverse side of the page).  \\"Fair\\" grades include \\"Fair/Good\\" (1.5) and \\"Fair\\" (1.0). These grades describe comics that are worn and in general disarray. Despite their condition, they still retain all of the pages and most of the covers. These comics may be torn, stained, faded, and brittle. \\"Poor\\" comics are what the name suggests--heavily damaged. They may be defaced, torn, stained, or have missing chunks. \\"Incomplete\\" comics are those missing covers or pages.  \\"Poor\\" (0.5) describes comic books that are missing pages and up to 1/3 of the cover. The comic may be brittle and defaced by other materials such as paint and glue. Some people will not grade a comic missing it's cover, but some give \\"Incomplete\\" comics a score between 0.1 and 0.3. If you have a comic that is extremely rare, you may wish to consider having it graded professionally. This allows you to speak confidently about it's condition in any setting, such as negotiations about pricing.  If you plan to have a comic professionally sealed (or \\"slabbed\\"), a professional grading is recommended, since any potential buyers will not be able to open the comic and assess it for themselves.

Article: For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West's overly indebted and sluggish   nations learn from a flourishing Asia? Just a few decades ago, Asia's two giants were stagnating  under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, \\"The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.\\" Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan's idea that \\"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. \\"Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day.

A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country's huge government deficit  without damaging productivity.

Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal.  Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Answer:","output":"Iron will corrode faster in a damp area like a rainforest compared to a dry area like a desert. This is because the main cause of iron corrosion is its reaction with moisture (usually from the air or water) and oxygen. In a damp environment like a rainforest, there is more moisture and humidity, which increases the rate of corrosion. In a dry environment like a desert, there is less moisture available for the iron to react with, thus slowing down the corrosion process. As for Jim and Eric, Jim's decision to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air is wise, as it helps prevent corrosion of the iron components, while Eric's boat is more likely to corrode faster due to the lack of protection."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

You may find it easier to write the abstract after you've finished the body of the paper. However, the abstract will come before the body in the final report. This section will provide some background information about the topic of your report. If you need to include a literature review, it will go here as well.  In the introduction, describe the problem or topic your report investigated. This could be a scientific issue, such as the rate of growth of mealworms, or a current affairs topic, such as increased security in airports.  Summarize relevant research, but don't let it take over the introduction. The bulk of your report should be your work, not discussion of others'. If you performed an experiment and are writing the report about it, describe your experiment in the introduction.

You'll need to describe the experiment or procedure briefly (use less detail than you did in the Methods section) and report the main results.  You can present the results in several different ways.

This starts with creating an abstract, which is essentially a concise summary of the report's entirety - question, methodology, finding, and relevance - often written at the end but positioned at the beginning of the report. Subsequently, we craft an introduction where we present the problem or topic the report examines in detail. Contextualization of the topic with relevant research is part of this process, but it must make sure not to overpower the original research conducted, which forms the core of the report. An essential section within a scientific report is the 'Methods' wherein the procedures, materials, and steps of the experiment or research are explained, preferably using the past tense. Subsequent to this, observations or results of the experiment or research are presented in a section often termed 'Results.' The tool of narration here is concentrating on recounting the main observations made, establishing a structure that logically conveys them without interpreting them. The interpretation of these observations and results is done in the 'Discussion' section, highlighting the critical findings at the outset and later delving into intricate details. Of relevance is the establishment of a link between one's results and the contextualizing literature reviewed, identification of further research requirements, and the elucidation of the broader relevance of the findings. The report concludes by answering the 'So what?' question, emphasizing the importance and utility of the discoveries made. In some cases, a separate conclusion section is used to wind up, reiterating vital points, but usually, reports conclude at the closing of the discussion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Elmer has Bugs Bunny cornered on his hunting trip, Elmer receives a telegram from his Uncle Louie who leaves him 3 million in his will, as long as he doesn't harm any animals, especially rabbits. Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic élan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmer's house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing \\"Angel in Disguise\\", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims that he is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologizes to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness, prompting Elmer to take him back in, afraid he may have lost the inheritance for good. Later a special delivery letter arrives for Elmer, which informs him that Uncle Louie has  \\"kicked the bucket\\" and that he now inherits the 3 million.  However, the amount of the various estate taxes, including a 2 million inheritance tax, claims the entirety of the inheritance and leaves Elmer owing Louie's lawyer 1.98.

Article: A mental professor walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the \\"half empty or half full\\" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired : \\"How heavy is this glass of water?\\" Different answers called out from the audience. She replied, \\"The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb  and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.\\" She continued, \\"The stress and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed--incapable of doing anything.\\" It's important to remember to let go of your stress.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Hollywood (, informally Tinseltown ) is an ethnically diverse, densely populated, relatively low-income neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. It is notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios, and its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people in it.  - George Burns (born Nathan Birnbaum; January 20, 1896March 9, 1996) was an American comedian, actor, singer, and writer. He was one of the few entertainers whose career successfully spanned vaudeville, radio, film and television. His arched eyebrow and cigar-smoke punctuation became familiar trademarks for over three-quarters of a century. He and his wife, Gracie Allen, appeared on radio, television, and film as the comedy duo Burns and Allen.  - Ben Blue (September 12, 1901  March 7, 1975), , was a Canadian-American actor and comedian.  - The Academy Awards, or \\"Oscars\\", is an annual American awards ceremony hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements in the United States film industry as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Academy Award of Merit, which has become commonly known by its nickname \\"Oscar.\\" The awards, first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS.  - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) is a professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures. The Academy's corporate management and general policies are overseen by a Board of Governors, which includes representatives from each of the craft branches.  - Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899  29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, at times referred to as \\"The Master of Suspense\\". He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres. He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England's best director. Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955.  - Burns and Allen was an American comedy duo consisting of George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen. They worked together as a successful comedy team that entertained vaudeville, film, radio, and television audiences for over forty years.  - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - \\"Thanks for the Memory\\" (1938) is a popular song, with music composed by Ralph Rainger and lyrics by Leo Robin. It was introduced in the 1938 film \\"The Big Broadcast of 1938\\" by Shep Fields and His Orchestra with vocals by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross. Dorothy Lamour's solo recording of the song was also popular, and has led to many mistakenly believing over the years that it was she, and Hope, who sang the tune in the film (in which Lamour also appeared).  - Charles Clarence Robert Orville Cummings, known as Bob Cummings (June 9, 1910  December 2, 1990), was an American film and television actor known mainly for his roles in comedy films such as \\"The Devil and Miss Jones\\" (1941) and \\"Princess O'Rourke\\" (1943), but was also effective in dramatic films, especially two of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers, \\"Saboteur\\" (1942) and \\"Dial M for Murder\\" (1954). Cummings received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Single Performance in 1955.

The motion picture star is at 6816 Hollywood Boulevard, the television star is on 1718 Vine Street.  - The Devil and Miss Jones is a 1941 comedy film starring Jean Arthur and Charles Coburn. Directed by Sam Wood and scripted by Norman Krasna, the film was the product of an independent collaboration between Krasna and producer Frank Ross (Jean Arthur's husband). Their short-lived production company released two films through RKO Radio Pictures (\\"Miss Jones\\" and 1943's \\"A Lady Takes a Chance\\"). The film was well received by critics upon its release and garnered Academy Award nominations for Coburn and Krasna.  - A character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \\"characters\\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role.   - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - Martha Raye (August 27, 1916  October 19, 1994) was an American comic actress and singer who performed in movies, and later on television. She also acted in plays, including Broadway. She was honored in 1969 with an Academy Award as the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient for her volunteer efforts and services to the troops.  - Bob Hope, KBE, KC*SG, KSS (born Leslie Townes Hope, May 29, 1903  July 27, 2003) was an American comedian, vaudevillian, actor, singer, dancer, athlete, and author. With a career spanning nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in over 70 feature films and short films, including a series of \\"Road\\" movies.

Known variously as \\"the Laughing Athletic Thunderbolt,\\" \\"the Apollo of the Silver Sheet,\\" \\"the Screens Greatest Athlete\\" and \\"the King of Smiles,\\" Walshs movie career stretched from the start of true US film-making to the Golden Era (20 years) during which time he was featured in approximately 80 productions. The studios he was attached to included: Mutual, Triangle, Fox, Universal, Goldwyn, United Artists, Chadwick, and Paramount.  - John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838  April 26, 1865) was an American stage actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. Booth was a member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.  - The Primetime Emmy Award is an American award bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. First given in 1949, the award was originally referred to as simply the \\"Emmy Awards\\" until the first Daytime Emmy Award ceremonies were held in the 1970s, and the word \\"prime time\\" was added to distinguish between the two.  - Ida Lupino (4 February 1918  3 August 1995) was an Anglo-American actress and singer, who became a pioneering director and producerthe only woman working within the 1950s Hollywood studio system to do so.

The majority of her later career as an actress, writer, and director was in television, where she directed more than 100 episodes of productions ranging across Westerns, supernatural tales, situation comedies, murder mysteries, and gangster stories. She was the only woman to direct episodes of the original \\"The Twilight Zone\\" series, as well as the only director to have starred in the show.  - College Swing , also known as Swing , Teacher , Swing in the U.K. , is a 1938 comedy film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring George Burns , Gracie Allen , Martha Raye , and Bob Hope . The supporting cast features Edward Everett Horton , Ben Blue , Betty Grable , Jackie Coogan , John Payne , Robert Cummings , and Jerry Colonna .  - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - The Television Academy Hall of Fame was founded by a former president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, John H. Mitchell (19211988) to honor individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to U.S. television.  - The Birth of a Nation (originally called The Clansman) is a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed and co-produced by D.

It is a popular tourist destination, with a reported 10 million visitors in 2003.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Dial M for Murder is a 1954 American detective fiction film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams. It was filmed in 3-D with the technology that was available at the time, and is often considered one of the greatest 3D films ever made.

The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. The movie was released by Warner Bros., though due to the then waning popularity of 3D films, it was converted to 2D, and only showed in its native 3D format in a small handful of cinemas.  - Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie \\"Gracie\\" Allen (July 26, 1895  August 27, 1964) was an American comedian who became internationally famous as the zany partner and comic foil of husband George Burns, her straight man.

The ship lands in a lake situated around the local fjords of ancient Norway during the time of the Vikings 709AD. From its wreckage emerge two bitter enemies: One) a soldier from another world that speaks Icelandic and states that he came from an Island to the North Kainan and two) a bloodthirsty creature known as the Moorwen. Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen. Kainan realizes from the last battle, that the Moorwen is almost impenetrable with the current metals used, and assists the Vikings by salvaging pieces of his crashed spacecraft and forging weapons capable of harming the creature. After a harrowing journey, the Vikings and Kainan confront the Moorwen...

Please write a short summary for the following article: Soar High With Boeing And Friends Instead of experiencing a global collapse, welcome to a rejuvenated aerospace cycle fueled by resumed business air travel that accompanies resumed global growth. Even domestic carriers are seeing better flow. Yes, many still fret about a double-dip in the economy and a new depression, but this stems more from acerbic political filters than clear-sighted analysis. China didn't tighten, it just dialed back on the easing and its next slowdown is still several years off. There are certainly security and trade issues but its overriding interest is to sustain economic growth. The nation's largest exporter, Boeing, and its extended supplier chain will accelerate through the year. As with tech and semiconductors, the upturn didn't just begin this year, last quarter or even the preceding quarter. The bottom in commercial air travel was last spring and the recovery began late in the second quarter of 2009 with business jet use turning about the same time. The headlines and Wall Street research didn't catch onto this improvement until recently, indicating significant upside remaining in the civil aviation and industrial derivative aerospace stocks. With the downsizing specter removed on the military side, a host of aviation plays will benefit, resuming their strong ride off last year's market bottom. Follow Intelligent Investing On Twitter.

The latest import and export statistics demonstrate the mutual benefit of unfettered trade, borne out by just released U.S. trade statistics showing banner exports. And with no inflation, there's no need to materially tighten. The recent flurry of ISMs also pointed to strong incoming orders, low inventories and increased hiring intentions. Combined with strong corporate profits, the key indicators point positive. Reverting to moderate from massive monetary stimulus does not constitute tightening, so dispense with the rhetoric and focus on the numbers. The world needs new planes. Boeing ( BA - news - people ) and its multitudinous supplier base are on an upswing. Boom times might still be a year off but they've turned the corner and the stocks are correcting. Dogged fixation on global imbalances might kneejerk bad fiscal news from minor leaguers Greece, Spain and Portugal but it pales besides positives from collectively far more consequential France, Germany and Italy. Right on cue, a way oversold U.S. dollar has strengthened, sent riptides through investor portfolios over-weighted to weak dollar plays such as commodities and energy. Perhaps brooking argument, per se, raw materials have been overhyped, have attracted massive capital investment and aren't the same crux of this economic cycle as they were the last. Complex fixed-income instruments that got Wall Street into so much trouble will give way to equities as investors reset to the new reality. Today's upturn is all about the application of high technology to infrastructure, manifested both in mobile Internet and sophisticated industrial processes. World-class companies that can apply technologic innovation to real world needs are where the action is. First and foremost this means leading-edge engineering and applied science, whether IT, data networks, environmental safety, industrial automation, clean power or transportation. The latest civil aerospace and automobile products incorporate advanced electronics and materials knowhow. Foremost in this market transition is a growing appetite for the best and brightest internationally traded companies. There's no substitute for Apple ( AAPL - news - people ), Intel ( INTC - news - people ), Broadcom ( BRCM - news - people ), Altera ( ALTR - news - people ), Xilinx ( XLNX - news - people ) and NetLogic, just like Boeing, Goodrich ( GR - news - people ), Precision Castparts ( PCP - news - people ), BE Aerospace ( BEAV - news - people ), Spirit AeroSystems and Rockwell-Collins have no peer. When the fundamental climate turns back up, those are the go-to names to which all investors turn. The first sector out of the box last year, semiconductors, have largely retraced to the 200-day moving average, their technical correction coinciding with roaring fundamentals. Defense stocks ended their underperformance streak as Obama doubled-down in Afghanistan and the new defense budget restored weapons funding. China's cyber-attacks, missile procurements and space tests finally got Washington's attention. The latest Quadrennial Defense Review, an every four years public summation of our defense posture, points to robotics and electronics technology as security bulwarks. Civil aviation stocks, on the other hand, roared off their spring 2009 bottom and have yet to full retrace their 200 day and might still have some work ahead. The focus on underlying fundamentals, however, points to resumed upward track at some point. Improving corporate profits necessarily leads to increased air travel. Summary:","output":"The aerospace industry, including companies like Boeing and its suppliers, is getting better because more people are traveling for business again. This helps airplane makers sell more planes and makes their stocks go up. There are also good things happening with companies that make computers, phones, and other technology that airplanes use.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Options are: i. yes. ii. no.","output":"ii. no. The answer provided does not respond correctly to the question. The question asks for the name of the cemetery where Fryderyk Chopin, the Polish composer and pianist, was buried. The correct answer is that Chopin was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, France. Chopin's heart, however, was interred separately and at his own behest; it was enshrined within a pillar at the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, Poland.  Chopin's burial at Père Lachaise Cemetery occurred after his death in 1849. The cemetery is one of the most famous cemeteries in the world, known for its notable occupants. It is a renowned tourist destination that attracts numerous visitors who come to pay their respects to the many famous people buried here, including writers, musicians, and philosophers.

Sentence 1: One part each, lending each its own essential quality to the mixture, so that the sky is solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air. Sentence 2: Equal parts earth, fire, waster and air. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Let's analyze both sentences step by step. Step 1: Break down Sentence 1 \\"One part each, lending each its own essential quality to the mixture, so that the sky is solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air.\\" Sentence 1 can be interpreted as follows: 1. There is a mixture containing equal parts (one part each) of four elements. 2. The mixture has properties similar to those of earth, fire, water, and air. 3. These properties include being solid like earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, and insubstantial as air. Step 2: Break down Sentence 2 \\"Equal parts earth, fire, water, and air.\\" Sentence 2 can be interpreted as follows: 1. There is a mixture containing equal parts of the same four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. Step 3: Comparison We can now analyze whether Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 have similar meanings. 1. Both sentences mention a mixture containing equal parts of four elements. 2. Both sentences reference the four elements earth, fire, water, and air. The main difference: 1. Sentence 1 goes into detail about the properties of the mixture (solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air), while Sentence 2 only mentions the equal parts of the four elements. However, since both sentences express the idea of a mixture containing equal parts of the four elements, it can be concluded that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Answer:","output":"Ring-shaped hydrocarbons are called cyclic hydrocarbons. These molecules consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a closed loop or ring, forming a cyclic structure. Cyclic hydrocarbons can be further classified into two main categories based on the presence or absence of double bonds within the ring: 1. Alicyclic hydrocarbons: These molecules have only single bonds within the ring, similar to an open-chain, or aliphatic, hydrocarbon. They are also referred to as cycloalkanes. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the ring. Examples include cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). 2. Aromatic hydrocarbons: These molecules contain one or more double bonds within the ring, resulting in delocalized electrons and resonance structures. Aromatic hydrocarbons are typically more stable and display unique chemical properties compared to their non-aromatic counterparts. The most well-known aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6), which consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, forming a hexagonal ring with alternating single and double bonds. Other examples include naphthalene, anthracene, and pyridine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D?  John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.  Hint: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. The answer is:","output":"Sample C would less likely be used as fuel compared to Sample D.  The reason behind this conclusion lies in the composition and properties of both samples. Sample C consists of U-238, which is the most abundant isotope of uranium, making up approximately 99% of naturally occurring uranium. On the other hand, Sample D contains U-235, which constitutes about 1% of naturally occurring uranium. Uranium-235 is the isotope of interest when it comes to nuclear fuel, as it is fissionable and, therefore, can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. In contrast, U-238 is not readily fissionable, making it unsuitable for use as a fuel source.  For uranium to be effective as nuclear fuel, the percentage of U-235 must be increased to at least 3%, which is achieved through a process called enrichment. Since Sample D is already U-235, it holds the potential for being enriched and used as fuel in a nuclear reactor with a higher efficiency. Sample C, on the other hand, will need to undergo separation from U-235, which is not only inefficient but also difficult, considering that chemical means of separation are unsuccessful due to the isotopes' identical chemistries. In summary, given the differences in fissionability and the need for enrichment, Sample C (U-238) would less likely be utilized as fuel when compared to Sample D (U-235)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"An Army drill instructor guiding his platoon in marching formation.\\", does this mean that \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"An Army drill instructor guiding his platoon in marching formation\\" does not imply that \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night.\\" These two statements are not directly correlated, as they describe two different scenarios and activities that a platoon might experience during their training. The first statement refers to a specific activity that takes place during military training, where a drill instructor is responsible for teaching and guiding their platoon members in various drills and exercises, including marching formations. The primary goal of these exercises is to instill discipline, coordination, and teamwork among the soldiers. Learning to march in a specific formation is essential for various parades, ceremonies, as well as providing efficiency, control, and flexibility when on the battlefield. The drill instructor plays a crucial role in ensuring the troops are well-prepared and maintain their discipline in all situations. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"A platoon goes to sleep for the night,\\" describes the end-of-day routine for the soldiers, where they retire to their designated sleeping quarters to rest and recuperate. Most military units, including platoons, follow a strict schedule that provides time for various activities throughout the day, including physical training, classroom instruction, practical exercises, meals, personal hygiene, and rest. Properly structured sleep and rest periods are essential for maintaining the health, focus, and overall well-being of soldiers. While both statements are part of a soldier's overall training and daily routine, one does not imply the other, as they represent different phases of a typical day at a military training facility. The first statement is an example of an exercise that takes place during the active portion of their training, while the latter is an instance that happens during their rest and recovery period. By addressing both aspects, the military ensures that its soldiers receive the necessary training and development to excel in their duties, as well as the proper care and rest to support their physical and emotional well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The road from Thusis through Bergün leads to La Punt in the Inn Valley (Engadin).  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The Albula Alps are a mountain range in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. They are considered to be part of the Central Eastern Alps, more specifically the Western Rhaetian Alps. They are named after the river Albula. The Albula Alps are separated from the Oberhalbstein Alps in the west by the Septimer Pass and the valley of the Sursés; from the Plessur Alps in the north-west by the Landwasser valley; from the Silvretta group in the north-east by the Flüela Pass; from the Bernina Range in the south-east by the Maloja Pass and the Inn valley (upper Engadine).  - Piz Julier (German) is a mountain of the Albula Alps, overlooking the Julier Pass, in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.

It connects the Engadin valley with the rest of Graubünden. At its summit, the pass crosses the watershed / drainage divide between the basins of the Rivers Rhine and Danube. The Julier Pass lies between Piz Lagrev and Piz Julier.  - Piz Surlej is a mountain in the Bernina Range of the Alps, overlooking Lake Silvaplana in the canton of Graubünden. It lies between the main Engadin valley and the Val Roseg, north of Piz Corvatsch.  - Piz Grevasalvas is a mountain of the Albula Alps, located north of Maloja in the canton of Graubünden. It lies on the range between the Julier Pass and Lake Sils.  - The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.  - Grisons (  see also other names) is the largest and easternmost canton of Switzerland. The canton shares borders with the cantons of Ticino, Uri, Glarus and St. Gallen and international borders with Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. The name Graubünden translates as the \\"Grey Leagues,\\" referring to the canton's origin in three local alliances, the League of God's House, the Grey League, and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions. Grisons is also home to three of Switzerland's ethnic groups and the subsequent languages of Swiss German, Italian and Romansh are all native to the state. It is the only officially trilingual canton and the only canton where the Romansh language has official status.  - Piz Corvatsch is a mountain in the Bernina Range of the Alps, overlooking Lake Sils and Lake Silvaplana in the Engadin region of the canton of Graubünden. With an elevation of , it is the highest point on the range separating the main Inn valley from the Val Roseg. Aside from Piz Corvatsch, two other slightly lower summits make up the Corvatsch massif: Piz Murtèl (north of Piz Corvatsch) and the unnamed summit where lies the Corvatsch upper cable car station (north of Piz Murtèl). Politically, the summit of Piz Corvatsch is shared between the municipalities of Sils im Engadin and Samedan, although the 3,303 m high summit lies between the municipalities of Silvaplana and Samedan. The tripoint between the aforementioned municipalities is the summit of Piz Murtèl.  - Lake Sils (German \\"Silsersee\\", Romansh: \\"Lej da Segl\\") is a lake in the Upper Engadine valley, Grisons, Switzerland. It takes its name from the village of Sils im Engadin. The lake lies at an altitude of 1,797 metres above sea level, between Maloja Pass and Lake Silvaplana. Several mountains over 3,000 metres overlook the lake, notably Piz Corvatsch, Piz Grevasalvas and Piz da la Margna. The lake's drainage basin culminates at Piz Fora (3,336 m) and comprises the Vadrec da Fedoz glacier.  - Lake Silvaplana ( German : Silvaplanersee ; Romansh : Lej da Silvaplauna ) is a lake in the Upper - Engadine valley of Grisons , Switzerland . It takes its name from the village of Silvaplana . The lake is also connected to the nearby Lej da Champfèr .

In Syria, there are some people who call themselves the \\"Islamic State fighters.\\" They are a group of people who are not very nice and don't like to share things with others. They want to keep everything for themselves and make other people follow their rules. One day, some of the Islamic State fighters decided to play near the long fence that separates Turkey and Syria. They started to throw rocks and other things at the Turkish soldiers who were guarding the fence. Just like in school, when someone throws something at you, it might hurt you and make you sad. The Turkish soldiers didn't like it when the Islamic State fighters threw things at them. They wanted to keep their land safe and did not want these not-nice people to come in and take their toys. So, the soldiers threw things back at the Islamic State fighters to make them go away. This is what we call \\"exchanging fire.\\" During this big fight, one of the Turkish soldiers got very hurt and sadly, he died.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the engineer think about Fergus?

This violated the game's terms of use and gave bot users an unfair advantage, it added. \\"Cheating of any form will not be tolerated,\\" said the message. Blizzard did not reveal how many accounts had been shut down. However, a widely-shared screengrab of a conversation between a player and a customer service rep suggested that about 100,000 accounts had been closed. The ban will be in force for six months, said Blizzard. The action is likely to hit many people who play World of Warcraft simply to get in-game gold that they can later sell to other players. These players often use bots to automate the repetitive steps needed to complete quests or other actions that generate gold. However, gaming news site Kotaku said the large number of banned accounts was likely to have caught more casual players who use third-party programs to automate the work characters in the game must do to refine raw materials or produce desirable crafted items. This, it said, probably explained the short duration of the ban. In the past, Blizzard had permanently banned people it had caught using bots and other helper programs. A WoW community manager seemed to confirm this conclusion in a tweet sent hours after the bans were enforced saying \\"botting\\" involved the automation of any action, not just movement. \\"If a program is pressing keys for you, you've violated the ToU [terms of use],\\" he said.

Process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane.  Question: suppose there are icebergs in the ocean happens, how will it affect wind speeds will develop more quickly.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less The presence of icebergs in the ocean can potentially affect the development of hurricanes and wind speeds by influencing the heat exchanges between the ocean surface and the atmosphere. To understand this effect, it is essential to consider the factors that contribute to the formation of hurricanes and the role played by ocean water temperature. Hurricanes typically form in warm ocean waters, particularly in the tropical regions where the water temperature is above 26.5°C (80°F). The warm water provides the necessary heat and moisture to fuel these storms. When the warm, moist air over the ocean surface rises, it creates an area of low pressure underneath it. This rising air then cools, condenses into clouds, and forms thunderstorms. As the thunderstorms come together around the center of low pressure, the Coriolis effect—caused by Earth's rotation—leads to the storm's rotation. The continuous supply of energy from the warm ocean water strengthens the storm, and when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is classified as a hurricane. Now, let's consider the impact of icebergs on this process. Icebergs are large masses of freshwater ice that have broken off from glaciers or ice shelves and are floating in open water. They are significantly colder than the surrounding ocean water, and their presence can lower the temperature around them due to the melting process, thereby cooling the nearby ocean water. This cooling effect could potentially slow down the development of hurricanes and reduce wind speeds. When the water temperature drops, there is less heat available for evaporation, which means less moisture is added to the atmosphere. With reduced heat and moisture, there would be less fuel to generate and sustain a hurricane. Moreover, cooler water temperatures might disrupt the formation of the initial thunderstorms necessary for a developing hurricane, making it harder for the storm to reach the 74 mph threshold. It is important to note that the presence of icebergs alone would not completely prevent the formation of hurricanes, as other factors like atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and ocean currents could still contribute to the development of a storm. However, their cooling effect on the surrounding ocean water can still make it less favorable for hurricanes to develop and could lead to lower wind speeds overall. In summary, the presence of icebergs in the ocean is likely to cause less favorable conditions for hurricane development and could lead to a reduction in wind speeds. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In fact, it has become a necessary and important part of the American way of life. In 1986, sixty-nine percent of American families owned at least one car, and thirty-eight percent had more than one. By giving workers rapid transportation, the automobile has freed them from having to live near their place of work. This has encouraged the growth of the cities, but has also led to traffic problems. For farm families the automobile is very helpful. It has made it possible for them to travel to town very often for business and for pleasure, and also to transport their children to distant schools. Family life has been affected  in various ways. The car helps to keep families together when it is used for picnics, outings, and other shared experiences. However, when teenage children have the use of the car, their parents can't keep an eye on them. There is a great danger if the driver has been drinking alcohol or taking drugs, or is \\"showing off\\" by speeding or breaking other traffic laws. Mothers of victims  of such accidents have formed an organization called MADD(Mothers Against Drunk Driving). These women want to prevent further tragedies . They have worked to encourage the government to limit the youngest drinking age. Students have formed a similar organization, SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving) and are spreading the same message among their friends. For many Americans the automobile is a necessity. But for some, it is also a mark of social position and for young people, a sign of becoming an adult. Altogether, cars mean very much to Americans.

When offering treats to your chinchilla, it's crucial to consider their nutritional needs and avoid providing snacks that could be harmful to their delicate digestive systems. Chinchillas thrive on a diet composed of high-quality hay, supplemented with pellets specially formulated for them. Treats should only constitute a small portion of their diet. Once you have identified a suitable treat, it's time to create a conducive training environment. Choose a quiet, calm space where your chinchilla feels secure and can focus on the training without distractions. Keep in mind that these animals are nocturnal, so the best training time would be in the early evening when they are naturally more active and alert. Next, establish a clear and consistent signal, such as a clicker or a specific word, to communicate with your chinchilla during training. This signal, often referred to as a \\"marker,\\" should be used whenever your chinchilla performs the desired behavior. By using the marker alongside the treat reward, you'll help your chinchilla associate the sound with the desired action and positive reinforcement. Start by teaching your chinchilla simple behaviors, such as coming to you when called or climbing onto your hand. Be patient and progress slowly, as chinchillas have a natural skittishness that can make it difficult for them to trust new experiences. Remember to always provide praise and reinforcement when your chinchilla completes the desired task. Build gradually on these foundational behaviors, introducing more complex actions as your chinchilla becomes more comfortable and confident. Always maintain a positive and patient attitude, ensuring the training sessions are enjoyable and rewarding for both you and your pet. Finally, be aware that training a chinchilla will take time and commitment. These intelligent animals have distinct personalities and will learn at their own pace. Consistency is key for successful training; conducting brief daily sessions will be more effective than sporadic, lengthy ones. By employing these techniques and principles, you'll be well on your way to developing a strong bond with your chinchilla and helping them learn new behaviors.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The chinchillas will need to time to get to know each other and bond before they mate. You will need to have small wire cages for each chinchilla ready. Make sure the cages are made of wire and are 18” high with very small mesh so the chinchillas cannot escape the cage.  You should also have a larger cage available so you can place the two chinchillas together in the larger cage once they are comfortable around each other and ready to mate. The cage should be big enough for the two chinchillas to move around and mate. You may include bolt holes or cubby holes in the larger cage. This will give the male a space to hide of the female does attack him before mating. You should also set up a cage for the kits so they have housing once they are born. You should use a cage that is no higher than 18” and 1” x ½” or smaller. The kits will likely climb the sides of the cage so it should be small enough for them to drop from a short height. Make sure the mesh is small all the way around the cage so the kits cannot climb out of the cage or slide through the holes. You should set up the breeding cage in a quiet area that does not get a lot of traffic in your home, such as a spare room. Chinchillas are averse to loud noises, strong smells, and being surrounded by new people. You should create a quiet, isolated environment for your chins so they can breed successfully.  Most chinchillas breed well in rooms that are kept at a cooler temperature, between 52 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Try to keep your chinchillas in a room below 75 degrees Fahrenheit at all times. You may place a fan in the room to circulate the air and play a radio on low in the room. The radio can help to block any outside noise or noise in your home.

These traditionally styled refrigerators tend to have fewer features, but they're usually cheaper than other options.","output":"Consider a bottom-freezer refrigerator if convenience and organization are important to you. This style positions the freezer at the lower part of the unit, so the refrigerator compartment is at eye level. This can make it easier to find and access your fresh foods. Bottom-freezer models often come in various configurations, such as pull-out drawers or swing door designs, offering extra flexibility and storage options. Look into side-by-side refrigerators if you have a limited space and you want easy access to both refrigerator and freezer compartments. With a vertical split design, these models provide equally accessible compartments for fresh and frozen foods. These refrigerators often come with features such as in-door ice makers and water dispensers, which can save space in both freezer and refrigerator compartments. However, the side-by-side doors may be narrower, which can make it difficult to store larger or wider items. Evaluate French door refrigerators if you want a combination of style, convenience, and storage efficiency. This design typically features a large refrigerator compartment at the top, with two side-by-side doors, and a bottom freezer compartment. This design offers wide shelves for easier flexibility in storing larger items, and many models also come with additional drawers and compartments for better organization. Consider the available space in your kitchen to determine the appropriate size and dimensions of the refrigerator. Measure the width, height, and depth of the area where the refrigerator will be placed, and be sure to take note of door swings and any other obstructions that may affect the placement. In addition, consider how much space you'll need for your food storage habits, taking into account the size of your household and how frequently you shop for groceries. Think about the energy efficiency of the refrigerator, as this can have a significant impact on your electricity bill over time. Look for models with an ENERGY STAR rating, which indicates that they meet efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. Some models may also include energy-saving features such as adaptive defrost and temperature sensors. Pay attention to the internal and external features of the refrigerator. Internal features to consider may include adjustable shelving, spill-proof shelves, gallon door storage, humidity-controlled drawers, and specialized compartments for specific foods like produce and deli items. External features might include a water dispenser or ice maker, fingerprint-resistant finishes, and smart technology for remote monitoring and adjustment. Take into account the noise level of the refrigerator, especially if your kitchen is adjacent to a living or sleeping space. Many modern models are designed to operate quietly, but some can still make a noticeable hum. It's a good idea to read customer reviews before making your decision. Set a budget for your refrigerator purchase, factoring in not only the cost of the appliance but also any delivery, installation, and recycling fees. Make sure to account for the potential need for water line installation in case you choose a model with a water dispenser or ice maker. Shop around to compare prices, features, and customer reviews. Visit appliance stores and browse online to get an idea of what is available in your desired style and budget range. Keep an eye out for sales and promotions, as you may be able to find a high-quality refrigerator at a discounted price. In summary, choosing your refrigerator involves considering style, size, energy efficiency, features, noise, budget, and available space in your kitchen. By taking all these factors into account and comparing different models, you will be able to find the perfect refrigerator for your needs and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

The story is about the interactions between an old man and a bear, detailing their individual experiences and their indirect collaboration for food gathering. While honey and fishing are indeed elements of the story, they aren't as comprehensive. The title \\"An Old Man and a Bear\\" covers all the main elements of the story: the old man's unsuccessful fishing attempt, his encounter with the bear at home, the bear's successful fishing using honey and flies, and the bear leaving fish for the old man. The focus is on the relationship between the old man and the bear.

Movie title: Halloween II Movie plot: After being attacked by Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), who vanished after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony on October 31, 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital that same night while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues to search for Michael. Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister.

(CNN)  -- Rory McIlroy has defended his preparation for this week's British Open as he bids to win back-to-back majors without playing any competitive golf since his U.S. Open triumph at Congressional. The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland has drawn comparisons with Tiger Woods for the manner of his eight-shot triumph, but has not lifted a club in anger in the intervening three weeks. It has led his former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie to question the wisdom of the lack of match practice, but McIlroy was adamant Tuesday that his approach worked for him. \\"I mean, I've prepared the exact same way that I've prepared for the last few major championships, and I feel it's a process that works for me, \\" he told of the official British Open website. \\"Coming to the course the week before, getting a couple of practise rounds in, and then not really getting to the course until Tuesday afternoon. \\"That works for me. I used to do it to sort of keep under the radar. I'm not sure I'll be able to do that anymore. But it works for me. Caddying for the world number one. \\"It might not work for other people, but I feel as if it's the best way for me to approach a tournament. It seems to have worked the last few times, so I just need to keep doing that.\\" McIlroy has also had to cope with being catapulted into celebrity ranks, with a high-profile appearance at the Wimbledon tennis championships plus a host of other media commitments. He admitted the reaction to his first major success had been something of a surprise. \\"I didn't realize how much of a fuss it would create or how much of a buzz,\\" said McIlroy. \\"I've already sort of noticed over the past three weeks it has been a bit of a life-changing experience, and it's just something I'm going to have to deal with.\\" McIlroy tees off at Royal St George's in the 140th edition of golf's oldest major at 9.09 local time with Ernie Els of South African and fellow young gun Rickie Fowler of the United States. He will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year's British Open at St Andrews which gave him the first round lead, but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory. Meanwhile, world number one Luke Donald bids for back-to-back victories of his own after claiming the Scottish Open at Castle Stewart at the weekend. Donald, who took over the mantle from fellow Englishman Lee Westwood, admitted he was in the form of his life. \\"This is probably the best I have ever played,\\" he said as he reflected on a stellar 2011 which has seen him claim three victories and a clutch of top-10 finishes. It was kickstarted by his victory at the WGC World Match Play tournament in Arizona. \\"As soon as you get that one win, it kind of opened up the door, gave me a lot of confidence, and I've been playing very well since then,\\" he added.

Question 2: Visas (entry/exit permits): Can I travel to USA (Tourism B2 visa) from India using the B2 visa issued in UK (London US embassy)? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: If I have a B2 multiple visa and exit to The Bahamas and then return to the USA, will my length of visit be renewed to another 6 months? Answer 1: The B2 visa is a type of U.S. non-immigrant visa meant for tourism, visiting family/friends, or medical treatment. This visa generally has a validity of up to 10 years and allows multiple entries. However, the validity of the visa is not the same as the maximum duration of your stay. The maximum duration of your stay in the U.S. during a single visit depends on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry, who usually grants an authorized period of stay for up to 6 months. When you travel to a nearby country, such as The Bahamas, and return to the USA, the U.S. CBP officer will decide on the duration of your authorized stay by considering various factors. This includes the purpose of your trip, your previous visits, and ensuring compliance with the rules and conditions of your B2 visa. There is no guarantee that your length of stay will be automatically renewed to another 6 months. It is up to the CBP officer's discretion to decide the length of your new authorized stay. It is crucial to understand that frequent and extended stays in the U.S. may raise suspicion and lead to denial of entry. Therefore, it is always advisable to maintain a reasonable gap between visits in order to avoid any issues at the U.S port of entry. Question 2: Visas (entry/exit permits): Can I travel to the USA (Tourism B2 visa) from India using the B2 visa issued in the UK (London US embassy)? Answer 2: Yes, you can travel to the USA using a valid B2 visa issued by any U.S embassy or consulate, regardless of the country in which you applied for it. The B2 tourist visa, in this case issued by the London U.S. embassy, is a non-immigrant visa that allows entry to the United States for tourism or medical treatment purposes. The important requirement is that your B2 visa should still be valid at the time you travel. If you hold a valid B2 visa issued in the UK and are currently in India, you can use your visa to travel to the United States. However, note that entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and remains at the discretion of the U.S. CBP officer at the port of entry. They will consider factors such as the purpose of your visit, your travel history, and your overall immigration and entry risk profile. A valid B2 visa granted by a U.S. embassy or consulate allows you the opportunity to request entry to the United States but does not guarantee that entry will be permitted. Comparison of answers: The answers to the two questions are not the same, as both questions address different aspects of B2 visa usage and entry regulations. - Answer 1 focuses on the renewal of the authorized stay period upon reentry to the U.S. after a trip to a nearby country (The Bahamas) while holding a valid B2 visa with multiple entries. The answer emphasizes that the duration of the authorized stay will depend on the discretion of the CBP officer.    - Answer 2 addresses the eligibility of traveling to the USA from India using a B2 visa issued in the UK. The answer confirms that it is possible to use a B2 visa issued in any country, as long as the visa is valid at the time of travel. The answer also emphasizes that the entry to the U.S. is not guaranteed and depends on the CBP officer's judgment at the port of entry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To easily make a bubble wand, take a length of medium wire, and use a pair of pliers to bend it into a loop, or whatever shape you want, until it folds back on itself and the hoop is complete.

Despite Satan becoming forcefully, physically intimate with Jenna and his unwillingness to speak, Jenna interprets these as Alex's devotion to his Satan costume. When Satan and Dougie leave to get Halloween candy, they end up shoplifting a market for candy and tools, where Satan subsequently kills a bagger who tries to stop them and the two engage in a brief physical assault spree with their shopping cart. On the way home, Satan engages in a combination of assaulting and killing several more people, including Alex's estranged dad, before he and Dougie are accosted by the police. Satan indicates to Dougie to run home while he confronts the police, who are later found to be dead. In the meantime, it is revealed that Alex has survived, who finds out from a babbling man that all the police on the island are dead and the police station is on fire.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.  Now, I have a new situation: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory.

It's considered to be the world's most sophisticated superfighter jet, but Britain's new £150million combat aircraft has been banned from flying in bad weather for fears it could explode. Engineers working on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have found the jet's fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning. According to reports, the aircraft, which is hoped to enter service for both the RAF and the Royal Navy in five years' time, has also been made more vulnerable to enemy attack than the aircraft it is set to replace, after its weight was reduced in an attempt to increase fuel efficiency. The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), has been banned from flying in bad weather, for fear its fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning. The Telegraph has reported the revelations were disclosed in a leaked report from the Pentagon's operational test and evaluation office, which states that, until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned, test-flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is 'not permitted'. Several other problems have been identified with the plane, including a fault in the design of the fuel tank which means it is unable to rapidly descend to low altitude. A handful of cracks were also discovered in the tested aircraft during examinations by the United States Air Force and the aircraft's manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The report states: 'All of these discoveries will require mitigation plans and may include redesigning parts and additional weight.' A Lockheed Martin spokesman has said the manufacturer does not consider the latest problem a 'major issue'. The spokesman said: 'We have. demonstrated very good vulnerability performance and we continue to work. with the Joint Programme Office.' The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph. The short take-off and vertical-landing version of the F-35B is due to become Britain's replacement for the Harrier. The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph and a range of 1,450 miles, compared to the Harrier's 700mph and range of 350 mile range.

And while the US is buying 2,500 F-35s for £254bn, Britain is committed to buying only 48, although the final decision will depend on the role of the Royal Navy's two new carriers in the future and whether the price of the aircraft falls, as is expected.

Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. It comprises 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where the capital, Abuja is located. Its largest cities include: Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Benin City and Port Harcourt. Nigeria is officially a democratic secular country.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The Republic of the Congo, also known as the Congo Republic, West Congo, Congo-Brazzaville or simply Congo, is a country located in Central Africa. It is bordered by five countries: Gabon and the Atlantic Ocean to the west; Cameroon to the northwest; the Central African Republic to the northeast; the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the east and south; and the Angolan exclave of Cabinda to the southwest.  - Gabon, officially the Gabonese Republic, is a sovereign state on the west coast of Central Africa. Located on the equator, Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west. It has an area of nearly and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.  - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana is a unitary presidential constitutional democracy, located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean, in the subregion of West Africa. Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km², Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south. \\"Ghana\\" means \\"Warrior King\\" in the Soninke language.  - Cape Three Points is a small peninsula in the Western Region of Ghana on the Atlantic Ocean.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Equatorial Guinea, officially the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, is a country located in Central Africa, with an area of . Formerly the colony of Spanish Guinea, its post-independence name evokes its location near both the Equator and the Gulf of Guinea.

Summarize this article: The drop never fell for physicist John Mainstone, but many of his colleagues and students may get to witness it later this year.      Mainstone, the custodian of the world's longest-running science experiment, died in his sleep on Friday. He was 78.      University of Queensland physicist Thomas Parnell began the experiment in 1927 by warming and pouring pitch—an extraordinarily viscous derivative of coal—into a funnel over a beaker. Parnell was trying to demonstrate that although pitch is so brittle that it'll shatter under a hammer blow, it is actually a liquid at room temperature and will flow and form drops. The only problem was that the drop formation is extremely slow, with eight and nine years passing between the first three drops.      By the time Mainstone joined the University of Queensland faculty in 1961, Parnell's pitch drop demonstration had been relegated to some dusty cupboard. Mainstone convinced the physics department to bring it out and display it.      Mainstone never personally got to see a drop fall, however. Neither did Parnell, nor anybody else in the world. Another pitch-drop experiment at Trinity College Dublin did create a drop this July that the college caught on camera. That demonstration began after the University of Queensland's, in 1944.      Although it takes years to form a drop, it only takes a few seconds for one to fall, and the exact time of the fall is unpredictable. One of Mainstone's drops fell in 2000, but the cameras trained upon it malfunctioned. There's a live camera aimed at the experiment right now. The feed looks eerily like a still photo.      Mainstone got an Ig Nobel in 2005 for \\"leading\\" the pitch drop experiment, but we're guessing the experiment didn't actually take up any of his time or taxpayer money or anything. (Except for those cameras.) The experiment is a curiosity and a bit of science décor for the University of Queensland.      Mainstone researched the physics of the Earth's atmosphere, Australia's ABC News reports. Before his death, he suffered a stroke and was treated by two cardiologists who had once been his students.      Earlier this year, he said he thought the next drop would fall before the year was out, PhysOrg reports. ||||| This undated photograph released on August 26, 2013 shows John Mainstone (3rd L) with students examining the world's longest running laboratory test, the Pitch Drop Experiment. Mainstone died last week after overseeing the experiment for over half a century. The science professor who oversaw the world's longest running laboratory test—the Pitch Drop Experiment—has died after more than half a century on its watch, his university said Monday.      John Mainstone, the former head of the Department of Physics at the University of Queensland, was in charge of the experiment which demonstrated the fluidity and viscosity of pitch, a tar derivative once used to waterproof boats.      The experiment, established in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell, was designed to show that pitch, although it feels solid and can be shattered by a hammer blow at room temperature, acts like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time.      It took three years for the pitch to settle and then the glass funnel holding the substance was cut to allow it to flow out.      In the 83 years since then, only eight drops of pitch have fallen and no one has seen one actually fall, the university said.      Earlier this year Mainstone, who died last week aged 78 after suffering a stroke, said it looked like the next drop would fall before the end of 2013.      \\"It's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop,\\" the professor, who had monitored the tar's glacial movements for 52 years, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.      The head of the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queensland University Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, said Mainstone would be greatly missed.      \\"Professor Mainstone's dedication to the long-running experiment well past his official retirement ensured that media, researchers and undergraduate students had easy access to relevant information and an understanding of the important science behind it,\\" she said.      \\"John's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment, he did not see a single drop fall,\\" she added.      The experiment is under constant surveillance, with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop's fall on camera.

Write a title for this article: FBI Director James Comey's announcement Friday that the bureau would investigate more emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's private server sent a jolt through the political world, setting off alarm and anger among Democrats who worry the news could swing the election to Donald Trump. It remains unclear whether the emails are new or pertinent to the probe Comey had ended months ago. But the decision to go public with his renewed interest has enraged the Clinton campaign, which called Comey's letter to congressional leaders \\"long on innuendo and short on facts.\\" Clinton, at an event Saturday, in Florida questioned his timing, saying she found it \\"deeply troubling.\\" In July, Comey invited scorn from Republicans when he made public his office's initial decision not to recommend charges against Clinton. At a glance, the career prosecutor is an unlikely candidate to take centerstage in this weird and wild presidential campaign, but history shows Comey has never shied away from grand gestures and the headlines that follow. Comey, who was appointed to a 10-year term that will carry into the next administration, came into national prominence in 2007 when, during testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told the story of a tense standoff over a federal domestic surveillance program with top officials from the administration of President George W. Bush. (Comey had been tapped as a deputy US attorney general under Bush in 2003.) The incident took place in the evening of March 10, 2004, according to Comey's account, with then-Attorney General John Ashcroft ill and incapacitated in a hospital intensive care unit. Top White House lawyer Alberto Gonzales (who would later become U.S. attorney general) and Bush Chief of Staff Andrew Card had raced to Ashcroft's side in an effort to have him sign off on an extension to the wiretapping program, which Justice Department attorneys had deemed illegal. The weakened Ashcroft managed to make clear his refusal and Gonzales and Card left the room -- with Comey, then Ashcroft's top deputy, watching on -- without a word. When lifestyle guru Martha Stewart was indicted in 2003 on a series of charges connected to a dodgy 2000 stock deal, it was Comey who brought the charges. ''This criminal case is about lying -- lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, lying to investors,\\" Comey, then a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a press conference. ''Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but because of what she did.'' Stewart was convicted on all counts in 2004 and sentenced to five months in prison. She served her time and was released in March 2005. In fact, the email server probe marked the third time Comey has investigated Bill or Hillary Clinton. His first run-in came in the mid-1990s, when he joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. There he dug into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to a Arkansas real estate venture gone bust. No charges were ever brought against either Clinton, but the scandal would eventually lead to independent counsel Kenneth Starr's probe that would result in the Lewinsky scandal. In 2002, Comey, then a federal prosecutor, took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton's 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted on a laundry list of charges before fleeing the country. The decision set off a political firestorm focused on accusations that Rich's ex-wife Denise made donations to the Democratic Party, the Clinton Library and Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign as part of a plan to get Rich off the hook. Comey ultimately decided not to pursue the case. The kicker: Comey himself had overseen Rich's prosecution between 1987 and 1993. Comey's first brush with the law was a traumatizing one. In October 1977, he and his younger brother were held captive in their home by the so-called \\"Ramsey Rapist.\\" The armed man, who cops were hunting following a series of home invasions, had recently assaulted two babysitters in the area. , the Comey brothers were held at gunpoint and locked in a bathroom inside their family's Allendale, New Jersey, house. They escaped through a window but were confronted outside by the suspect before bolting back in and contacting police. Comey became the seventh FBI director when he was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2013, by a 93-1 count, with Sen. Rand Paul the lone holdout. The Kentucky Republican had threatened to block Comey's nomination, but relented and allowed a vote after being further briefed on FBI drone surveillance policy. Comey succeeded Robert Mueller III, who had held the job for the previous 12 years. In his testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill, Comey insisted that his FBI is \\"resolutely apolitical.\\" Comey himself, however, does have a partisan past -- as a Republican. \\"I have been a registered Republican for most of my adult life,\\" he said before adding that he is \\"not registered any longer.\\" The 6-foot-8-inch Comey, a basketball player like President Barack Obama, is the tallest FBI director in the bureau's history. In a White House ceremony to announce his nomination, Obama winked at Comey's height, calling him \\"a man who stands very tall for justice and the rule of law.\\" Editor's note: This story, first published in July, has been updated after FBI Director James Comey announced a new review of emails possibly linked to Hillary Clinton's private server.

The five youngsters, all aged between 12 and 15, were stopped by officers after a shocked bystander took a picture of them hanging on to the back of the bus as it drove up a hill in Dudley, West Midlands. But instead of charging them after they admitted being carried or towed by a motor vehicle, officers thought of a more productive punishment - they made them clean up the local us depot. Dangerous: A group of five youngsters were spotted hitching a ride on the back of a bus on rollerskates. PC Reg Steele, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As this was a minor traffic offence it could have been dealt with in two ways, either through the courts where a fine could have been processed or a community resolution. 'We agreed with National Express West Midlands that a community resolution would be the best solution and would give the youngsters time to think about their reckless actions. As well as cleaning up the depot, the group will also have to clean National Express's fleet of West Midlands buses. Raj Mishra, National Express West Midlands Operations Manager said: 'We hope that by the youngsters working with us to clean our vehicles and spending time on site with us, it will help them understand the dangers of using vehicles to tow them along.' Police guidance suggests officers should use them only for low level offences in which no-one is hurt, or for anti-social behaviour. Punishment: The youngsters, who were filmed by a shocked passer by, were made to clean up a local bus depot and its buses by police. Earlier this year, a schoolboy nicknamed 'the Titch-hiker' was named and shamed by his parents and handed over to police after video footage emerged of him hitching a lift home on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry. Sonny Wilson, 12, was captured on film sitting on the back of the truck as it drove through Blackburn, Lancashire. His father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian both saw the footage on Facebook and called the police. Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind, who were filming him, a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street.

What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Bla bla Gooodd\\" Answer:","output":"To determine the star rating of this review, we'll need to analyze the text and sentiment of the message, understanding that \\"★\\" represents the lowest rating and \\"★★★★★\\" the highest. Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. First, read the review: \\"Bla bla Gooodd\\" 2. Identify any positive or negative sentiment within the review. In this case, the word \\"Gooodd\\" seems to be a positive sentiment, despite the multiple repetitions of the letters \\"o\\" and \\"d\\". The phrase \\"Bla bla\\" is more ambiguous, possibly indicating indifference or a neutral sentiment.  3. Assign a star rating based on the positivity or negativity of the sentiment. In this case, we'll mostly consider the positive sentiment in \\"Gooodd.\\" 4. Taking into account the positive sentiment in \\"Gooodd,\\" along with the neutral sentiment of \\"Bla bla,\\" it's reasonable to assume that the reviewer is not overly enthusiastic about the subject. Therefore, we can estimate a middle-ground rating, rather than the highest rating. Answer: ★★★ stars.

Meanwhile, \\"What is the longest recorded song?\\" specifically asks for the longest song that has been formally recorded and presumably, published or released in some manner. This question excludes theoretical pieces and includes only music that one could potentially listen to, given they have access to the recording.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the best way to: how do you stop a shoe from stinking up?","output":"Making sure your shoes do not stink can be achieved in a number of ways. Here are some steps we can follow: 1. Cleaning: The first course of action should be trying to clean the shoes. Sweaty or wet shoes can trap smells. Some shoes are safe to toss in the washing machine, which makes for an easy cleaning process. If the shoes cannot be washed, wipe them down with a damp cloth mixed with mild soap. Why this is necessary: it helps clear the dirt and sweat which are the primary cause of the smell. 2. Dry Shoes Properly: After you have washed your shoes, or after a sweaty day, it's important to let them dry out properly. Never put them away wet or even slightly damp. If you can, remove the insoles and let them dry separately. Why this is necessary: A wet environment is the perfect habitat for bacteria and mould, which can contribute to bad smells. 3. Use Baking Soda: Baking soda is a widely recognized deodorizer, and once your shoes are dry, you can sprinkle some inside each shoe and let it sit overnight. The next day, be sure to shake out or vacuum the remaining baking soda out of the shoes. Why this is necessary: Baking soda doesn't just mask odors; it actually absorbs them, making it a powerful tool for this task. 4. Utilizing Essential Oils: Essential oils such as tea tree, cedarwood and eucalyptus offer antimicrobial and antifungal properties along with a pleasant smell. A few drops on the insoles can help combat shoe odor. Why this is necessary: This step helps to combat bacteria that may be causing the odor and replace it with a pleasant smell. 5. Use of Dryer Sheets: If you have a particularly smelly pair of shoes, consider inserting a dryer sheet overnight to help eliminate the odor. Why this is necessary: The perfume and detergents in these sheets can neutralize odors, making this an easy and accessible solution for smelly shoes. 6. Maintenance: Wear socks whenever possible to absorb sweat and regularly rotate your shoes so no single pair takes all the punishment.  Why this is necessary: This helps prevent the accumulation of bacteria due to sweat. Following these steps and understanding why they work will help you to stop a shoe from stinking up in the most efficient and effective manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Democrat closes with a flourish on the generic campaign ad tagline: \\"I approve this message, because I would like to see Sen.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to do the same. (Jason Kander)      Politicians have long liked to hold guns in campaign spots. They really like to fire them. Now, a candidate has introduced a new caliber of gun ad.      Democrat Jason Kander, who is challenging Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) for his seat, appears in an ad blindfolded and standing at a wooden table in a darkly lit warehouse. As he begins to speak, Kander starts piecing together a rifle. The metallic clank of each part falling into place accentuates his argument, and the beginning of the ad establishes his credentials as someone who knows how to use guns, and respects them, too. But despite his proclaiming of support for the Second Amendment, it's not an ad that's likely to make the National Rifle Association happy.      \\"I also believe in background checks, so that terrorists can't get their hands on one of these,\\" Kander pivots.      Second Amendment advocates argue that background checks would limit a constitutionally guaranteed right, while background-check advocates say it's a simple matter of keeping weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals.      Recent efforts at passing background-check legislation haven't gone very far in Congress. But the American public apparently isn't as split as the legislature; The Post reported last fall that about 85 percent of gun owners support universal background checks for purchasers.      Kander actually has a chance to take Blunt's seat; despite its GOP lean at the federal level, Missouri is ranked the 10th most likely to flip parties in The Fix's most recent Senate rankings, in part because Democrats consider Kander, a 35-year-old secretary of state and Afghanistan war veteran, a strong recruit.      If his newest ad resonates with voters, Kander will be that much closer. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Democratic Senate candidate Jason Kander is using a new ad to demonstrate his support for the Second Amendment and to counter criticism from the National Rifle Association (NRA). The ad shows Kander, who is currently challenging Senator Roy Blunt for his seat in Missouri, assembling a rifle blindfolded. Kander voices his support for Second Amendment rights while also expressing his belief in background checks to prevent terrorists from acquiring firearms. The NRA had previously accused Kander of being someone who would vote against Second Amendment rights.

Time      Education Secretary Betsy DeVos after a series of listening sessions about campus sexual violence in Washington, D.C., on July 13, 2017. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)      Saying the Obama administration “weaponized” the U.S. Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights to work against students and schools, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday said she would replace the current approach to addressing sexual misconduct on college campuses with “a workable, effective and fair system” that more explicitly takes into account the rights of the accused.      DeVos said the Trump administration would roll back Obama’s “failed” Title IX guidance on sexual assault and harassment.      Educators, she said, have complained that the current system amounts in many cases to “kangaroo courts,” in which the rights of the accused are given short shrift unless they can afford to hire legal representation to pursue complaints.      “No student should be forced to sue their way to due process,” she said.      The speech, delivered at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, was livestreamed on the department's Facebook page.      DeVos gave a measure of credit to the Obama administration, saying it “helped elevate this issue in American public life — they listened to survivors, who have brought this issue out of the back rooms of student life offices and into the light of day.”      The Obama administration's 2011 \\"Dear Colleague\\" Letter threatened to pull funding from schools that didn't take sexual assault and harassment seriously.      But the 2014 guidance that resulted from Obama's efforts has applied an ambiguous and overly broad definition of sexual assault and harassment, DeVos said, leading to \\"intimidation and coercion of schools\\" and, in a few cases, strange results: In one case, she said, a school opened a Title IX investigation after a male student who couldn't remember the name of a female instructor filled in a form with the name \\"Sarah Jackson,\\" a lingerie and swimsuit model.      “Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation,\\" DeVos said. \\"But if everything is harassment, nothing is.”      In a statement, National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García said educators nationwide \\"are appalled that the Department of Education has decided to weaken protections for students who survive campus sexual assault or harassment. This decision offends our collective conscience and conflicts with the basic values of equality, safety, and respect that we teach our students every day.\\"      Eskelsen García called the proposed change \\"another example of a Trump-DeVos agenda that scorns respect for survivors, including Secretary DeVos’s own recent meeting with radical anti-woman activists and the president’s own recorded sexual assault confession during the campaign.”      Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, said DeVos' announcement suggested \\"that she would prefer to take America back to a time when it was more difficult for survivors of sexual assault to receive justice. For the LGBTQ community, which faces disproportionate levels of sexual assault and violence, this decision sends a strong signal that the U.S. Department of Education will not use its full power to protect them from harm.\\"      Philadelphia attorneys Gina Maisto Smith and Leslie Gomez have said universities understand Title IX's high-level mandates but are getting tripped up on the mechanics. Schools lack the resources and the tools, including subpoena power — that can harm students on both sides of an investigation.      The pair have proposed universities utilize a network of regional centers, formed through partnerships between schools and law enforcement, that \\"could be a significant resource for resolving reports of misconduct that violate both Title IX and state criminal law.\\"      Maisto Smith and Gomez, former career prosecutors who spent decades advocating for survivors — and whose damning investigation in 2016 into sexual assault allegations at Baylor University led to the ouster of former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr as president — said both universities and law enforcement face challenges responding to sexual violence.      \\"Unless we engage in meaningful cultural and process changes, these challenges will persist,\\" Smith said.      Brett Sokolow, executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators, a professional association that helps schools ensure Title IX compliance, said DeVos' announcement doesn’t mean most universities won’t continue to address sexual violence on campus.      \\"The response will occur mostly at the margins, Sokolow said. \\"There are 20% of colleges that weren't all that committed to Title IX to begin with, and this is going to give them the excuse to pull back. But for 80% of the colleges out there that aren't at the margins, this is a cultural shift that's already taken place, and they're smart enough to understand that a rollback of sub-regulatory guidance doesn't change the fundamentals of Title IX that have been in place for 45 years.\\"      DeVos has made a priority of revamping Title IX guidance, saying last July that the department should more equally weigh the claims of assault victims and the due-process rights of the accused.      But her department's efforts have also brought unwanted notoriety. In an interview last July, Candice Jackson, DeVos’ assistant secretary for civil rights, said 90% of campus sexual assault claims “fall into the category of, 'We were both drunk, we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.'\\"      Jackson later apologized for the remark, calling it \\"flippant.\\"      Last June, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights voted to open a two-year investigation of the Trump administration's civil rights enforcement, particularly related to the education department under DeVos. The commission's chair is Catherine Lhamon, who oversaw civil rights under Obama's education department.      Follow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo; Follow Alia E.

Don't just sit and watch. Speak up. Any rollback of Title IX protections will hurt your classmates, your students, your friends, your sisters.\\"      The 2011 Obama guidance for the first time pushed school district, college and university leaders to combat sexual harassment, including sexual violence, saying the institutions were required to do so under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination. Women's groups hailed that as a crucial step in cracking down on sexual violence on campuses. But critics said it trampled the rights of the accused.      The Trump administration will revamp the guidance through a rulemaking process that likely will take months, DeVos said, blasting the guidance for having \\"weaponized the Office of Civil Rights to work against schools and against students.\\" She said the administration will give all sides a chance to offer opinions on how it should move forward.      \\"We will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective and fair system,\\" DeVos said. \\"This is not about letting institutions off the hook. They still have important work to do.\\"      Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.      DeVos said after the speech that she intends to revoke the Obama guidance.\\"The process is an extended one,\\" she told CBS News. \\"But it is the intention to revoke or rescind the previous guidance around this.\\"      The Education Department will issue temporary Title IX guidelines for school districts, colleges and universities as it works on a permanent replacement for Obama-era guidelines, said agency spokeswoman Liz Hill.      The far-reaching 2011 Obama-era guidance, issued in the form of a Dear Colleague Letter, was controversial from the start. It threatened a loss of funding to schools that failed to do enough to make students safe from sexual harassment, assault and rape. Critics said it pushed colleges to trample the rights of the accused. Among other things, the guidance pushed a lower standard of proof in campus disciplinary hearings than is used in criminal trials.      Many of those critics hailed DeVos' announcement as \\"a really positive development.\\"      “I think it was a strong signal from the department that the current approach is unworkable and needs to be changed,” said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil rights group that brought a court challenge to the 2011 guidance.      Chris Perry, deputy executive director of the group, Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, which represents people accused of sexual assault, said DeVos' remarks show “the secretary is listening to folks.\\"      The decision to launch a notice-and-comment process was long expected. DeVos said in July — after a series of meetings with sexual assault survivors, students accused of assault and college officials — that she would overhaul the policy. She told reporters at the time that “it’s clear that there are failings in this process. A system without due process protections ultimately serves no one in the end.”      Advocacy groups — including those representing both sexual assault survivors and students accused of assault — were not invited to attend Thursday's announcement in person, despite meeting with DeVos on the subject in July.      Instead, DeVos delivered the announcement during a tightly controlled half-hour event at the university's Arlington, Va., campus, sponsored by the university law school chapter of the Federalist Society, a conservative group. Shouts from protesters outside could be heard as she spoke.      Advocates for survivors of sexual assault said they felt they were given short shrift and noted that research has shown false claims of rape are rare. They said DeVos had indicated she would hold similar listening sessions in other parts of the country before making a decision.      Giving them just one meeting with the secretary \\"feels a little bit like paying lip service to the importance of having survivors in the room,\\" said Jess Davidson, managing director of End Rape on Campus.      \\"I think there’s been a really concerning false equivalence of the concerns of survivors and the accused throughout this entire process with the Department of Education,\\" Davidson said.      Sexual assault survivors rallied outside the university ahead of the announcement, urging DeVos to keep what they see as crucial protections in place.      \\"It's really telling us that we don't matter, that our pain is not relevant to people in power,\\" said Chessy Prout, 18, who said she was assaulted as a high school freshman and subsequently had to change schools.      Advocates slammed the speech afterward. “Don’t be duped by today’s announcement,\\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center. \\"What seems procedural is a blunt attack on survivors of sexual assault. It will discourage schools from taking steps to comply with the law — just at the moment when they are finally working to get it right. And it sends a frightening message to all students: Your government does not have your back if your rights are violated. This misguided approach signals a green light to sweep sexual assault further under the rug.”      Complicating the issue for DeVos are comments made by her civil rights chief, Candice Jackson, who told The New York Times this summer that 90 percent of sexual assault claims stem from drunken and regretted sex. Another complication is President Donald Trump's boast about groping women in the infamous \\"Access Hollywood\\" tape.      “Secretary DeVos decided today to continue a pattern of undermining survivors’ rights, once again showing a clear lack of understanding or empathy for the millions of students who have experienced sexual violence on campus,\\" Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement.      But her announcement drew praise from at least one Republican lawmaker.      \\"The Department of Education is taking a positive first step in soliciting comments from stakeholders to get a better understanding of ways to better address the problem,” Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said. \\"However, this is an issue where Congress must give the Department of Education clear statutory authority to properly regulate.\\"      Despite the administration's plan to rewrite rules on Title IX, it's unlikely that schools will immediately change policies that they spent the last six years writing — and sometimes rewriting — to remain in compliance with federal law.      \\"No school is going to go back to doing what they were doing before the 2011 guidance,\\" said Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education.      Mel Leonor contributed to this story. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced plans to replace the current approach to addressing sexual misconduct on college campuses with “a workable, effective and fair system” that takes into account the rights of the accused.

The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl who is of similar age to her daughter. Yoshimi discovers that the upstairs apartment, the source of the leak, was formerly the home of a girl named Mitsuko Kawai (æ²³å ç¾æ´¥å­ Kawai Mitsuko; Mirei Oguchi), who was Ikuko's age. She had attended the same kindergarten Ikuko now attends. Mitsuko was abandoned by her mother and vanished more than a year ago.

Step 2: Assessing the options Given that the two options presented involve committing some form of crime (theft or physical assault), we need to establish if there is an alternative option to these choices to evaluate the hypothesis. Step 3: Alternative option In order to conclude that the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes\\" is true, we need to prove that there is a possibility for the person in the premise to choose not to commit a crime. This alternative option can be expressed as \\"you choose not to steal or bash someone over the head, and instead, decide to not commit a crime.\\" Step 4: Evaluating the hypothesis Based on the alternative option, we can now evaluate the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes.\\" By choosing not to steal or physically assault someone, the person in the premise would indeed not commit crimes, making the hypothesis true under these conditions. Conclusion: Since an alternative option of not committing a crime exists, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis \\"You do not commit crimes\\" can be true based on the given premise.

These hydraulic systems provide reliable and efficient power transmission for tasks requiring precise manipulation and heavy lifting. The foundation of these hydraulic systems lies in the fundamental principle of fluid mechanics, where the pressure exerted on a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. Hydraulic fluid power motors are at the core of these systems and function as actuators converting fluid pressure into rotational mechanical energy. By doing so, these motors allow machinery to perform diverse tasks, including lifting, pushing, and rotating, with high precision and force. Since the defined category of hydraulic systems excludes those for civil aircraft of subheading 8412.29.10, it does not encompass the ones specifically designed for use in the aviation industry. Civil aircraft hydraulic systems play a critical role in controlling various aspects of an aircraft's operation, such as landing gear retraction, steering, and braking. By isolating this category, we primarily focus on hydraulic systems used in other industries and applications. Similarly, hydraulic power engines and motors, linear acting, are also excluded from this category. Linear-acting hydraulic systems, also known as hydraulic cylinders, provide linear or straight-line movement by converting fluid power into mechanical power. These linear systems are commonly used in a vast array of applications, such as construction equipment, manufacturing machinery, and automotive components. As contrasted with rotary actuators like fluid power motors, linear-acting hydraulic systems grant a range of movement in a straight path. Applications for hydraulic systems powered using hydraulic fluid power motors are quite diverse, spanning industries like agriculture, construction, material handling, marine, mining, and transportation. Some specific examples may include operating heavy machinery like excavators or bulldozers, controlling steering systems in ships, operating cranes and hoists, and powering various types of presses. The advantages of using hydraulic systems powered by hydraulic fluid power motors are multifold. Firstly, they offer a high power-to-weight ratio, enabling compact and lightweight designs without sacrificing power. They also deliver constant torque over a wide range of speed and load conditions. Additionally, hydraulic systems are straightforward to control, and feedback mechanisms can be easily integrated, ensuring precision and smooth operation in various applications. However, hydraulic systems are not without their drawbacks. They are prone to leaks, require regular maintenance, and can create environmental concerns due to the use of hydraulic fluids. Ongoing innovations and improvements in the design and materials of hydraulic systems are necessary to address these issues and continue to enhance their efficiency, reliability, and sustainability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from options. \\"the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River doing what over long periods of time?\\" Choices: (i) blazing. (ii) melting. (iii) moving steadily. (iv) evaporating.","output":"The Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River doing option (iii) moving steadily over long periods of time.  The evidence supporting this statement is based on several factors, including the geological formation of the region, the study of the sedimentary layers, the analysis of the erosional processes, and the course of the river itself. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Geological formation: The formation of the Grand Canyon is a result of millions of years of geological processes. The area was once covered by ancient seas, which deposited layers of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. Over time, these layers were uplifted and exposed due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. This set the stage for the Colorado River to flow through the area and begin the process of erosion and the eventual carving of the canyon. 2. Sedimentary layers: The Grand Canyon's rock layers reveal a history of deposition and erosion spanning millions of years. The layers are evidence that the Colorado River slowly and steadily eroded the rock over long periods of time. The different colors and compositions of these layers indicate that they were deposited during different geological time periods and under differing conditions. For example, the Bright Angel Formation (limestone) and the Tapeats Sandstone indicate that these were formed under the oceans, while the Coconino Sandstone, consisting of aeolian deposits, show the presence of ancient deserts. 3. Erosional processes: The Colorado River is responsible for eroding these sedimentary layers, gradually cutting downwards through the layers to create the Grand Canyon we see today. This process was aided by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, which increased the river's gradient, resulting in more forceful erosion. The river's flow is characterized by a steady movement, occasionally interrupted by seasonal floods, which cause significant erosion during high-intensity flow events. 4. Course of the river: The formation of the Grand Canyon isn't only determined by the vertical erosion but also by the meandering pattern of the Colorado River. As the river flowed, it twisted and turned, cutting deeper into the plateau. The complex network of tributaries connects to the main course of the river, further reinforcing the idea that the continuous and steady flow was the main driver for the canyon's formation. In conclusion, the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River steadily moving over a long period of time (option iii) as supported by geological, sedimentary, erosional, and river course evidence. This slow yet relentless process of erosion by the Colorado River, combined with the regional uplift, created the majestic and awe-inspiring landscape we now know as the Grand Canyon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For a moment, Paul wasn't even sure who had walked into the room. Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so.

William asked Hunter to drop the charges against his client because","output":"William believed that the evidence against his client was weak, and he felt that pursuing the charges would result in an unjust conviction, potentially causing harm to his client's reputation, social standing, and future prospects. Additionally, William had uncovered new information that pointed towards either misconduct during the investigation, or procedural errors made by law enforcement. Moreover, William argued that the alleged victim's testimony was inconsistent and uncorroborated, making the chances of securing a conviction slim. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of protecting the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he saw the danger of allowing charges to proceed to trial when the foundation of the case was so tenuous. Furthermore, the witnesses called forth by the prosecution seemed unreliable, either through their criminal backgrounds or unanswered questions about their credibility. Upon analyzing the overarching facts and circumstances, William sensed that the charges against his client were based on ulterior motives or personal vendettas that could have clouded the judgment of those involved. He contended that, if allowed to proceed, the case would be a prime example of weaponizing the criminal justice system for personal gain, undermining the very principles of justice and fairness the system set out to protect. Additionally, William highlighted the potential waste of resources in pursuing such a case, given the limited budget allocated to public prosecutions. He stressed that the resources would be better spent focusing on cases with stronger evidence and clearer prospects for justice. Hunter, as the prosecutor responsible for pursuing charges, should consider the impact of their decision not just on this case, but on the broader public interest and community safety. By dropping the charges against his client, William argued that Hunter would uphold the integrity of the legal system and avoid devoting valuable time, money, and effort to a case built on shaky ground. This would instead allow for a thorough reevaluation of the available evidence and provide an opportunity for law enforcement to investigate alternative leads that may yield stronger suspects and a more just course of action. In conclusion, William asked Hunter to drop the charges against his client based on the following reasons: the weak evidence, inconsistencies in testimonies, potential misuse of the criminal justice system, the need to preserve the presumption of innocence, the importance of resource allocation, and the overall need to maintain the integrity of the legal process. By doing so, he believed that justice would be better served and that the public's trust in the system could be maintained."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Dedicating today's show to our Facebook fans at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, California. Thanks for your \\"likes\\" at Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews! I'm Carl Azuz, your captain of current events on this February 10th, 2011. First Up: Egypt in Crisis. AZUZ: For Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, things are going pretty much like they normally would. Yesterday, he met with members of his government and officials from other countries. But on the streets of Cairo, things are anything but normal. Thousands of protesters jamming the downtown area for the 16th day in a row. These people are mad at the government and they want Mubarak out of office now. The Egyptian vice president met with some of these protesters and promised that things will change. But there are concerns -- and not just from Egyptians -- that those changes aren't happening quickly enough. Here's CNN's Barbara Starr. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: With crowds swelling in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a greater sense of urgency from the U.S. that the Egyptian government needs to show change is coming. In a phone call, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden telling Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman there must be a transition with \\"immediate, irreversible progress.\\" ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy, about not seeing a lift of the emergency law. And I don't, I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress. STARR: But a calmer approach from the Pentagon, where sources say they are easing back from crisis atmosphere. ROBERT GATES, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: I think the Egyptian military has conducted itself in exemplary fashion during this entire episode. And they have acted with great restraint. STARR: Middle East analyst Michelle Dunne says the U.S. government message has changed from immediate action to a more protracted process. A process that is unclear. MICHELE DUNNE, MIDDLE EAST EXPERT, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT: President Obama has been calling for a transition to begin now. On the other hand, we hear Secretary Clinton a couple of days ago saying we support the process laid about by Vice President Suleiman, which is not a process the opposition has agreed to at all. STARR: There is a growing concern the man the U.S. is supporting, the new Egyptian vice president, is not on the same page. DUNNE: Up until now, the Obama administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition, that the Egyptian government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner, so to speak, in this transition. What Suleiman is offering right now is not that at all. (END VIDEO) More Winter Weather. AZUZ: Weather report is starting to sound like a broken record, and that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. Yes, there is yet another round of winter storms moving across the country. This is what Oklahoma City looked like on Tuesday, parts of the city getting up to 12 inches of snow. And this is just one week after that massive winter storm we reported on hammered the region. There are winter weather alerts from Texas all the way to the East Coast, with forecasts for rain, wind, snow and sleet through the rest of the week. Sound Check. BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in the past few months, although the unemployment rate remains high. State of the Economy. AZUZ: Well, you've heard of the president's State of the Union speech. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a kind of \\"state of the economy\\" address to Congress. And as you heard, he didn't really offer a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. It was kinda like a \\"thumbs sideways.\\" Talking to the House Budget Committee, Chairman Bernanke said Congress needs to make big changes to help stabilize the economy. The Federal Reserve has taken its own steps to try to get things going in the right direction. But some members of Congress, including the chairman of the budget committee, disagree with the Fed's actions. And they let Bernanke know how they felt during yesterday's hearing. Shoutout. TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Pendergast's class at Washington Middle School in Yakima, Washington! Name the region in California that's home to many of America's high-tech industries. Is it: A) Death Valley, B) Magnificent Mile, C) Technology Row or D) Silicon Valley? You've got three seconds -- GO! Silicon Valley is where you'll find a center of U.S. information technology. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Silicon Valley's Projected Growth. AZUZ: The name comes from silicon being a main component in computer circuits. You heard Chairman Ben Bernanke a moment ago mention the economic recovery. There are signs of that in Silicon Valley, and it has to do with web sites that a lot of us visit every day. Dan Simon looks at some of the businesses that are on the rise in the valley. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebook is getting a new home address, the company announcing that it's taking over nearly eighty acres of property here in Menlo Park, California. It's taking over the former campus, which was held by Sun Microsystems. Facebook also announcing that it's going to be adding about a thousand workers over the next twelve months. And industry observers say it's sort of a barometer of what you're seeing here in Silicon Valley. Google announcing just last week it's adding six thousand people to its workforce. And what you're seeing is basically three sectors where the hirings are taking place. When it comes to social networking, of course led by Facebook and Twitter, mobile computing. We're talking about smart phones and all the applications that go on those smart phones, a lot of expansion there. And when you talk about cloud computing, any information or data that you get on your phone or PC that comes from the cloud. I had a chance to talk to Michael Copeland. He's a senior writer for Fortune Magazine. He says this is one of the most exciting periods he's ever seen here at Silicon Valley. MICHAEL COPELAND, SENIOR WRITER, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: I think it is on fire if you're in the right part of the industry. So clearly, social networking like Facebook, Google, the internet cloud, mobile. Those things are all going like gangbusters. If you're a mobile app developer in Silicon Valley, you can pretty much write your own ticket. SIMON: Economic figures released from the state of California show that Silicon Valley added a little more than eight thousand jobs in 2010. That trend expected to continue into 2011. But the question is is what broader impact will that have, not only here in California, but across the rest of the United States. Dan Simon, CNN, Menlo Park, California. (END VIDEO) Proposed Law on Sexting. AZUZ: The state of Texas is considering a new law focused specifically on the issue of \\"sexting.\\" The Texas attorney general says the goal of this proposed law is to educate instead of criminalize. Right now, sexting can lead to some very serious consequences. Sandra Endo explains how and why the state is thinking about making this change. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: When being social turns into sexting, that's when many teens could run into problems. A new proposed law in Texas is aimed at addressing teen sexting, punishing teens who send the texts and their parents. GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: They are exposing themselves 'round the world forever more. ENDO: A new survey shows one in five teens admitted sending or posting suggestive images of themselves. Nearly four in ten teens admitted sending sexually suggestive messages. The proposed law would charge the teen with a misdemeanor, forcing a court appearance, and require parents to enroll in an educational program. Eventually, offenders could wipe the slate clean at 17 years old. ABBOTT: Our goal is not to put more teens behind bars, but to try to prevent this type of conduct from taking place. ENDO: Right now, teens can be charged with possessing or trafficking in child pornography, an offense which carries the potential of decades of prison time and being on the registered sex offender list for life. Still, the new proposed law is aimed at helping teens think twice before they click and hit send. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People don't really care. Teenagers don't really care. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't think about it at all. They're not thinking when they do it. It's terrible. ENDO: In Washington, Sandra Endo for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Before We Go. AZUZ: All right, we need to set the scene for you for today's Before We Go segment: high school basketball game, third quarter's winding down. And that's when he grabs a rebound, one of the players just lets it fly. It made it! All the way across the court. This wasn't half court; this was full court. I don't think he was even trying to score. The buzzer beater still counted. And those three points, actually the winning margin in the game. This YouTube video of the last-second shot is getting a lot of hits. Goodbye. AZUZ: Which means the shot is generating a lot of buzz-er. We'll try to rebound from that pun tomorrow. And we hope you'll give us a shot. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"On February 10th, 2011, CNN Student News covered various events and topics, including the ongoing crisis in Egypt, updates on the economy in Silicon Valley, and a proposed law on sexting in Texas. Protests in Egypt continued as thousands of people demanded Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down from office. Egyptian officials promised change, but there were concerns about the pace at which changes were happening. The U.S. called for more urgency and pressured the Egyptian government for a faster transition towards democracy. Positive economic signs were seen in Silicon Valley, with key companies such as Facebook and Google planning significant expansion, adding thousands of jobs over the next year. Companies in social networking, mobile computing, and cloud computing were leading the growth in the tech industry. In Texas, a proposed law on sexting aimed to educate rather than criminalize. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and lawmakers proposed punishing both teenagers who send explicit texts and their parents, hoping this would deter conduct leading to legal consequences. The proposed law would charge teens with misdemeanors and require them and their parents to enroll in educational programs. In the sports segment, a high school basketball game featured a full-court buzzer-beater shot that secured the game's win, garnering attention on YouTube."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - A Death in the Family is an autobiographical novel by author James Agee , set in Knoxville , Tennessee .

With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States.

The literary technique is distinguished from an autobiography or memoir by the stipulation of being fiction. Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction, the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the \\"autobiographical pact\\". Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author's life. While the events of the author's life are recounted, there is no pretense of exact truth. Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes.  - Tanasi (also spelled Tanase, Tenasi, Tenassee, Tunissee, Tennessee, and other such variations) was an historic Overhill Cherokee village site in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States.

Abandoned by the Cherokee in the 19th century, since 1979 the town site has been submerged by the Tellico Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River. Tanasi served as the de facto capital of the Cherokee from as early as 1721 until 1730, when the capital shifted to Great Tellico.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west.  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

Roger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring.  Interviewer: So what happened, why didn't you?  Roger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again.

Anyway, after talking it over with friends who had moved out I thought I'd like to give it a try--after all, a change of scene...  Interviewer: Is better than.., yes, we all know that. So, where did you go when you did decide to move?  Roger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own.  Interviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills?  Roger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm.

While in the UK, the visitors spent Â£2.2bn, a rise of 2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The increase comes as the weak pound makes the UK more affordable for visitors, but also follows terror attacks in London and Manchester. Meanwhile, UK residents took a June record of 7.2 million trips abroad, up 4%. However, with the fall in the value of sterling putting them at a disadvantage, the amount they spent leapt by 15% to Â£4.6bn. The big increase in visitors from North America, from 483,000 in June of last year to 650,000 this year, was \\"clearly buoyed by the particularly sharp drop of the pound against the dollar since mid-2016\\", according to Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The number of visitors from Europe rose by 2% to 2.241 million. The weaker value of the pound since the Brexit referendum vote means that the UK is now a much cheaper destination than it used to be. Many mainland Europeans, Americans and Chinese people are taking advantage of that. That's clear from the cacophony of different languages and accents outside Buckingham Palace, and on the streets around the Palace of Westminster. \\"It's a little more economical than it was a few years ago,\\" says one visiting American tourist. Meanwhile, a German man said the euro-pound rate has \\"made me quite happy\\". UK tourism sector booms as sterling falls The best month so far this year was April, with 3.7 million visitors coming to the UK - up 19% from a year earlier. Over the April-to-June quarter the number of visitors from overseas rose to 10.75 million, up 8% from the same period a year earlier. But while holiday visits were up by 20% to 4.7 million over the same three months, business visits were down by 4% at 2.4 million. VisitBritain director Patricia Yates said: \\"Tourism is one of Britain's most valuable export industries and this continued growth demonstrates the industry's increasing importance as a key driver of economic growth across our nations and regions.\\" Summary:","output":"The weak pound has attracted a record number of North American tourists to the UK, with visits rising 34% to 650,000 in June, while the number of visitors from Europe rose 2% to 2.241 million, according to the Office for National Statistics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Griffin, who has been leader since 1999, said he had had \\"more than long enough\\" in charge and had seen off both external and internal attempts to \\"destroy\\" the party in recent years. While May's European election results had been \\"brutally hard\\", he said the party was capable of \\"winning\\" again. Mr Griffin has been replaced as acting chairman by Adam Walker. The 55-year old, who will take the new role of party president, lost his seat in the European Parliament in May. The party has suffered a string of electoral setbacks in recent years, getting just over 1% of the vote in May's European elections and losing the majority of its local council seats in England. In a statement on the party's website, Mr Griffin said he had stepped down voluntarily at a meeting of the party's national executive committee on Saturday. He insisted he would remain an \\"active\\" member of the BNP and be on hand to offer advice to Mr Walker and whoever was elected leader in a leadership ballot due to take place next year. \\"The decision was mine and mine alone, though it involved a lengthy and constructive discussion between the entire collective leadership,\\" he wrote. He suggested the party was in a more stable financial and political position than it had been for some time. \\"I had initially hoped to hand the responsibility over several years ago, but when a concerted effort was made to destroy the BNP from both outside and within, I decided that it was my duty to stay and steer our movement through the storm,\\" he said. \\"The leadership team is united as to the way ahead and, once again, the BNP - for all that there are many improvements to be made - is the only effectively functioning, genuine nationalist game in town.\\" Mr Griffin has been the public face of the BNP for more than a decade, during which time the party increased its popular support despite being dogged by allegations of racism, which it has always rejected. Under his leadership, the party's vote in European elections had increased from 1.1% in 1999 to 3.9% in 2004 and 6.2% in 2009, when Mr Griffin was himself elected as an MEP. In 2009, Mr Griffin was invited to appear on Question Time, the BBC's flagship political discussion show, a decision which led to widespread demonstrations at the time. In recent years, the party's fortunes have declined steeply amid internal fighting. Andrew Brons, the BNP's other representative in the European Parliament, quit the party in 2012 to become an independent, while Mr Griffin was challenged for his position last year. Mr Griffin, who was declared bankrupt earlier this year, failed to secure re-election as MEP for the North West of England in May as the party lost its deposit in all the UK's electoral regions in which it fielded candidates. The BNP blamed its poor performance on the rise of UKIP, which it said had become the party of choice for protest votes about Europe and immigration. In his statement, Mr Griffin said while it would be wrong to blame him solely for the party's electoral slump, he accepted responsibility and stepping down would prevent the risk of \\"months of internal friction\\". And he defended his track record during his years in charge. \\"A party which, until I took it over, had only ever held a single council seat for a few months, is now on course to have had unbroken elected presence in British politics for 17 years,\\" he said. In its own statement, the BNP said Mr Walker, from Spennymoor, County Durham, \\"has accepted the role of acting chairman of the British National Party after Nick Griffin stepped aside\\" \\"The full national executive are united in their support for Adam in this role,\\" it added.

Mr. Griffin was replaced by Adam Walker as the acting chairman. Despite a series of electoral setbacks, Mr. Griffin expressed optimism for the party's future and its capability to win again.

The surgery Planinic underwent after breaking his hand during a game against the Washington Wizards falls under the realm of sports news and updates. The world of professional sports is highly competitive, and athletes often push their bodies to the limit in order to excel in their chosen field. Injuries, unfortunately, are a common occurrence in this high-stress environment, and it is crucial for athletes to receive proper medical attention to treat injuries and prevent further complications. In this particular case, Zoran Planinic has broken his left hand, which is a significant setback for any basketball player, as the ability to use both hands effectively is essential for various aspects of the game such as dribbling, passing, and shooting. Being a guard, this injury can be even more impactful, as guards are typically responsible for handling the ball and controlling the pace of the game. The fact that Planinic needed surgery on his broken hand underlines the severity of the injury and the necessity of proper rehabilitation and recovery to avoid long-term issues. The timeline for his recovery is uncertain, and the text mentions that he will be out \\"indefinitely,\\" which implies that there is no clear date set for when he will be able to return to the court.

Mr Besigye said the result had been rigged, while foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation. In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.

They felt their home was like being surrounded by a lot of soldiers. Mr. Besigye doesn't agree with the result of the vote because he thinks it wasn't fair, like when someone peeks during a hide-and-seek game. Some people from foreign countries agreed with him saying the voting was scared and was not friendly.  But Mr. Museveni said he didn't cheat. He said Mr. Besigye is just trying to make people upset and disturb the peace.

Filmed in what the old movie posters used to call \\"A Riot of Color\\" it resembles nothing more than an expensively-dressed but intellectually-challenged production of \\"The Student Prince\\" .Mr James Mason,wearing a very natty little white number,utilises his all-purpose mittel-European accent whenever he remembers.I am a great admirer of his and I sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing. Mr Omar Sharif,who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful,gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the Crown Prince.He is utterly unconvincing as a man who -in the movie at least-cut a swathe through the distaff side of the Austrian aristocracy.With his well-buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms.As a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk,leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes.Unhappily married,he falls in love with a commoner.\\"Forbidden Love\\" is one of the movie's come-ons.As she is played by the most uncommon Miss Catherine Deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there.Miss Deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it,particularly in the sequence set at the ballet.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision.

Answer:","output":"Gerald R. Ford was the President when Nelson Rockefeller served as Vice President of the United States. Now, let's explore this period in more detail. Nelson Rockefeller was the 41st Vice President of the United States, serving under President Gerald R. Ford from December 19, 1974, to January 20, 1977. Rockefeller, a Republican, was also a well-known businessman, philanthropist, and a prominent figure in the U.S. political landscape, belonging to the influential Rockefeller family. President Gerald R. Ford assumed the position following the resignation of Richard Nixon due to the Watergate scandal, becoming the 38th President of the United States. Ford, a Republican as well, was a former Congressman from Michigan who had been appointed as Vice President, succeeding Spiro Agnew, before his rise to the presidency. Upon taking office as President, Ford needed to choose a Vice President as outlined in the 25th Amendment, and he selected Nelson Rockefeller. After Ford announced his choice, the U.S. Congress confirmed Rockefeller as Vice President through a majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.  During their tenure, President Ford and Vice President Rockefeller focused on addressing the economic challenges of that time, including high inflation and unemployment. This period was marked by the \\"stagflation\\" phenomenon, a situation where stagnant economic growth and high inflation occurred simultaneously. Under Ford's administration, measures were taken to guarantee fiscal responsibility, stabilize the economy, and restore public trust after the Watergate scandal. In the 1976 presidential elections, President Ford sought re-election but faced a tough challenge from the conservative wing of his own party, led by Ronald Reagan. Rockefeller, who was regarded as a moderate Republican, stepped down as Ford's running mate to improve Ford's chances of securing the nomination. Ultimately, Gerald Ford won the Republican nomination but lost the presidential election to Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter. In summary, Gerald R. Ford was the President when Nelson Rockefeller served as Vice President of the United States. Their administration navigated complex economic challenges and attempted to rebuild public trust in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both political confabs should inspire us all Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you should appreciate the important role that presidential nominating conventions play. As a political Independent, I certainly do. By H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Former president Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic convention Wednesday night. By H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Former president Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic convention Wednesday night. I was interested in nearly everything and inspired and sometimes entertained by much of what I saw or heard from Tampa last week and Charlotte this week. Now we're in for lots of fact and some fiction before the November election. As an Independent, I find it equally challenging to watch the players on both political teams. Looking back at Charlotte and Tampa, aside from the two candidates and their spouses, Bill Clinton clearly stole the show. The most remarkable thing about him is that he's made many or most of us forget or forgive about his sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky while he was in the White House. For the Democrats, aside from President Obama himself, Clinton clearly is the person who can deliver the most votes. On the Republican side, Mitt Romney must pretty much do it by himself. With former president George W. Bush staying on the sidelines (he was barely mentioned in Tampa), there is no other GOP personality who can make major contributions for Romney. No matter how the immediate post-convention chatter shapes up, you should keep your eyes and ears on the presidential campaign. Nothing else — not even the start of the football season or the upcoming Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series— should steal you from following political developments.

Movement generally involves converting energy from one form to another to produce motion. The following are examples of things that require energy to move: 1. Animals: As mentioned in your statement, animals require energy to move. They obtain this energy from food, which mainly consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These nutrients are broken down during cellular respiration, where stored chemical energy is converted into the usable form of energy called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP powers the contraction of muscles, allowing animals to move. 2. Humans: Similar to animals, humans also require energy to move. The human body goes through the same cellular respiration process to generate ATP, which fuels muscle contractions and facilitates movement such as walking, running, and lifting objects. 3. Plants: Although plants don't move in the typical sense, they do exhibit certain types of movement such as growth, phototropism (movement towards light), and the opening and closing of stomata. They require energy for these movements, which they obtain through photosynthesis (converting sunlight into chemical energy). 4. Machines: All types of machinery, from vehicles and industrial equipment to household appliances, require energy to move or perform their intended function. This energy may come from electricity, fossil fuels, or other energy sources, depending on the design and purpose of the machine. 5. Natural phenomena: Numerous natural phenomena require energy to produce motion. Examples include earthquakes, which result from the shifting of tectonic plates; ocean currents, powered by the energy from wind and the sun; and weather patterns, driven by the uneven distribution of solar energy across the Earth's surface. 6. Microorganisms: Microscopic entities like bacteria, fungi, and protozoa require energy to move and perform other cellular functions. They extract energy from their surroundings, either through the consumption of organic material or via other metabolic processes. 7. Chemical reactions: Molecular motion and chemical reactions also require energy. Reactants must possess sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier for a reaction to occur. Additionally, molecular motion plays a crucial role in enabling chemical reactions by allowing molecules to collide and react with one another. 8. Astronomical bodies: Celestial objects such as planets, stars, and galaxies also require energy to move. They obtain this energy from gravity, which causes them to follow specific orbital paths. Meanwhile, stars convert nuclear energy into light and heat through nuclear fusion processes, radiating energy out into space. In summary, energy is required to facilitate movement in a wide variety of contexts, from the cellular to the cosmic scale. This fundamental principle underscores the critical role energy plays in supporting life and driving the countless processes and mechanisms that occur in the universe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The name \\"Melanesia\\" (\\"islands of dark [people]\\") is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \\"land of the blacks\\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. The concept among Europeans of Melanesia as a distinct region evolved gradually over time as their expeditions mapped and explored the Pacific. Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an 'old black race' in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Bingo is an outcast circus dog whose owners, Steve and Ginger, pay little attention to. Their star puppy, Lauren, develops an infection from having stepped on a nail, so they use Bingo in place of her for their next act, The Ring of Fire. But Bingo is afraid of fire (due to the fact that he experienced it as a young puppy and furthermore lost his own mother that way) and chickens out. In rage of the embarrassment, Steve gets ready to shoot him, but his wife, Ginger stops him and while trying to restrain him, tells Bingo to start over and find a family. Bingo does so when Ginger finally agrees with Steve to kill him when Bingo mistakes her orders several times. The next day, Chuckie and his brother, Chickie along with friends of his go for a bike ride but Chuckie is too slow. To prove to the clan that he isn't scared, he attempts to jump a bridge (with sunglasses), but based on lack of skills, nearly kills himself in the process.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Western artist R.V. (Ron) Jahns creates his unique western wildlife paintings by tapping  into   his vast experience of true life. He had rich western experiences out in the mountains in the great Northwest. Ron paints from the heart and his experience as a cowboy in the west. He has a particular passion   for the mountains from Eastern Oregon to Alaska and draws from his many years of mountain adventures as inspiration for his western paintings. Born and raised on a farm, this cowboy artist is well knowledgeable with the subjects of his Western art. Ron struggles for historical accuracy in his western cowboy paintings when an artist gives a false description of the facts about cowboys in the west! Living in Alaska for 17 years added a new factor to Ron's western art. As a hunter and fisherman he observed the wildlife in its natural setting and has conveyed this spirit to his canvas. Ron's western art can be viewed throughout the United States, in Europe and through occasional private showings. You can find western wildlife paintings by Ron at various art shows throughout the year. For a list of art shows the Cowboy Artist will be attending, visit his Art Show page. Although a self-taught western artist, Ron himself has taught painting in colleges and through private lessons. Ron is quite a storyteller and the last of an old kind of cowboy poets and western storytellers. If you've met Ron at the Flea Markets in Sumpter, Oregon then you no doubt have already had a taste of his knack   for telling tall tales and sharing his original cowboy poems of true life on the ranch.

Step 2: Identify the sentiment-related words Since there are only two real content words in the tweet (\\"Neva\\" and \\"been\\"), we will focus on those for sentiment analysis. \\"Neva\\" is an informal way of writing \\"never\\" and \\"been\\" is just a past participle of \\"be\\". Step 3: Determine the sentiment of the keyword \\"Neva\\" can be used to express a negative sentiment, as it may indicate a lack of experience or association with something. However, it's not strong enough to classify it as purely negative, as the context might change its meaning. The other keyword, \\"been,\\" does not have any inherent sentiment value. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet Without more context or information, it's challenging to assess the sentiment of this tweet because it's quite ambiguous. However, given that \\"Neva\\" could express a lack of experience or association, the sentiment of the tweet could be leaning slightly towards negative or neutral.

Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died.

However, as explained in option i, the premise clearly states that a woman is sitting, which confirms the hypothesis. The fact that she is also with two rabbits in a cage does not create any obstacles or contradictions to the hypothesis, so the hypothesis remains true. Thus, this option is not valid.

I got my first real job when l was ten.My dad, Benjamin, injured his back working in a cardboard - box factory and was retrained as a hairstylist.He rented space in a little mall and gave his shop the fancy name of Mr.Ben's Coiffure. The owner of the shopping center gave Dad a discount on his rent for cleaning the parking lot three nights a week, which meant getting up at 3 a.m. to pick up rubbish. Dad used a little machine that looked like a lawn mower.Mom and I emptied rubbish cans and picked up rubbish by hand.It took two to three hours to clean the lot.I'd s1eep in the car on the way home. I did this for two years, but the lessons I learned have lasted a lifetime, I acquired discipline  and a strong work morality , and learned at an early age the importance of balancing life's competing interests---in my case, school, homework and a job.This really helped during my senior year of high school, when l worked 40 hours a week flipping hamburgers at a fast-food joint while taking a full load of college-prepared courses. _ .I attended the U.S.Military Academy and went on to receive graduate degree in law and business from Harvard.Later, I joined a big Los Angeles law firm and was elected to the California state committee.In these jobs and in everything else I've done, I have never forgotten those nights in the parking lot.The experience taught me that there is dignity in all work and that if people are working to provide for themselves and their families, that is something we should honor.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"He regretted having worked in the parking lot\\" is NOT true of the author. The author never expressed any feelings of regret about working in the parking lot.

He also stressed that the experience taught him to value and respect all forms of work, reinforcing the lesson he learned from his parents about the worthiness of exertion to provide for oneself and one's family.

Q: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

However, it can be assumed that upon release, the prisoners had the freedom to choose from a variety of meals that were not available to them while incarcerated. This could include meals from restaurants or fast food establishments, homemade dishes prepared by family or friends, or even simple comfort food they may have missed while in prison. The choice would likely vary based on individual preferences, cultural backgrounds, and personal circumstances. Additionally, some of the released inmates may have received support and guidance from rehabilitation programs or halfway houses, which could also influence the type of meal they had upon their release.

Tanya is jealous of Betty's hair although","output":"Tanya is jealous of Betty's hair although she tries her best to stifle her envy and appreciate her own unique qualities; she cannot help but constantly compare her thin, straight locks to Betty's thick, voluminous curls that appear effortlessly perfect. Every day, Tanya enters school and sees Betty's gorgeous hair cascading down her back, and the feeling starts anew. She admires the way Betty's curls never seem to fall flat, bounce gracefully in the sunlight, and perfectly frame her face. In contrast, her own straight hair often feels lifeless and limp, requiring careful styling and product application to achieve a semblance of volume. In an attempt to boost her self-esteem and transform her hair into something she can be proud of, Tanya decides to research haircare tips and tricks online. She discovers a plethora of information about proper hair nutrition, styling techniques, and recommended products that could potentially improve the appearance and health of her tresses. Over time, she starts incorporating her findings into her daily routine, experimenting with different styles and formulas in the hope of enhancing her natural beauty. As she becomes more confident with her own hair, Tanya starts to understand that comparisons to Betty are not only unwarranted but also detrimental to her self-esteem. She begins to appreciate that her straight hair possesses unique benefits, such as being more manageable and taking less time to style than Betty's luscious curls. Moreover, Tanya discovers that her straight hair serves as an adaptable canvas, allowing her to try out new and bold styles with relative ease. In addition to evolving her haircare routine, Tanya develops an interest in fashion and makeup, as well as focusing on her academics and extracurricular activities. By shifting her focus towards enhancing her individuality and pursuing her passions, she gradually learns to accept and even love her own hair, embracing the notion that beauty comes in many forms and cannot be defined by a single attribute. Ultimately, Tanya realizes that jealousy is a useless emotion and that, instead of envying what others have, she should be grateful for her own unique qualities and strive to be the best version of herself. Through self-discovery and personal growth, she manages to overcome her jealousy of Betty's hair, with newfound confidence and appreciation for her own natural beauty. Even though the initial sentiment of jealousy towards Betty's hair remained as an influence in self-improvement, Tanya's journey led her to self-acceptance and the understanding that comparisons only serve to hinder one's path to true contentment.

The author seems to be expressing delight and enjoyment in participating in a fire drill at their workplace, which may not be a universally shared emotion. The extended duration of the fire drill (1 hour) is noted, but the author portrays it with a touch of irony, creating a sense of humor in the message. Analyzing the tweet's components, we can see that the use of 'love it' indicates a positive sentiment. The reference to a '1 hr long fire drill' not only provides context but also serves as a background to explain why the author is feeling excited and appreciative of the experience. The use of the words \\"back after\\" carries a sense of accomplishment, which further adds to the positive sentiment of the tweet. It is important to note that sentiment analysis of any social media post or tweet is subjective and can be open to interpretation. Some readers may perceive the tweet as light-hearted or even sarcastic due to the unusual length of the fire drill.

Plot title: Arlington Road Movie plot: Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college history professor at George Washington University who has been raising his nine-year-old son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), since the death of his FBI agent wife, who was killed in the line of duty in a scene loosely based on the real-life Ruby Ridge incident. Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident.At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance. He left a note for William explaining everything. He built the pipe bomb to get back at the government. When William's friend Oliver died he took his name the next day to hide his past.

Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology. Described by Dez Skinn in \\"Comix: The Underground Revolution\\" as the work which \\"threw Peter Bagge into the limelight\\", Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradley characters' story in \\"Hate.  - Hate is a comic book by writer - artist Peter Bagge . First published by Fantagraphics in 1990 it ran for 30 issues , and was one of the best - selling alternative comics of the 1990s , at its height selling 30,000 copies an issue . In 2000 Bagge revived the series in Hate Annual , a yearly comic which continues the story after Hate in short stories , in addition to Bagge 's writings on Libertarianism and culture and topical cartoons . Hate follows the life of Buddy Bradley , in a continuation of events from Bagge 's strip \`\` The Bradleys '' from former publications Neat Stuff . It is set for the first half in Seattle and later in suburban New Jersey . Buddy has to deal with the end of adolescence , reluctantly growing up , his relationships with a host of unpleasant acquaintances he has to class as friends , working in dead - end jobs and having no direction in life . Bagge used memories of events from his own life as material . Hate has been referenced by many commentators as an important example of Generation X comic culture and grunge culture in general . Bagge tends to see the parallels with the grunge lifestyle as largely coincidental , as he was referencing events that had happened to him ten years previous . The comic was also released in Europe in the mid 90s as Spanish , Italian and German language editions , the Spanish Odio proving particularly popular .  - Underground comix are small press or self-published comic books which are often socially relevant or satirical in nature. They differ from mainstream comics in depicting content forbidden to mainstream publications by the Comics Code Authority, including explicit drug use, sexuality and violence. They were most popular in the United States between 1968 and 1975, and in the United Kingdom between 1973 and 1974.  - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising.

Alternative comics present an alternative to mainstream superhero comics which in the past have dominated the American comic book industry. Alternative comic books span a wide range of genres, artistic styles, and subjects.  - Peter Bagge (pronounced , as in \\"bag\\"; born December 11, 1957) is an American cartoonist whose best-known work includes the comics \\"Hate\\" and \\"Neat Stuff\\". His stories often use black humor and exaggerated cartooning to dramatize the reduced expectations of middle-class American youth. He won two Harvey Awards in 1991, one for best cartoonist and one for his work on \\"Hate\\". Bagge has expressed his libertarian views in features for \\"Reason\\".  - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction.  - The Harvey Awards are given for achievement in comic books.

Article: The researchers, led by Hwang Woo-suk, insist they cloned an Afghan hound, only to help investigate   human disease, including the possibility of cloning stem cells   for treatment purposes.  But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther.  \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago.  Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed.  Uncertainties about the health and life span   of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis.  Wilmut and others  _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\"  The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted  with more than 1,000 cloned embryos.  In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea.

The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"energy usage.\\" This choice best describes the process of how a gasoline engine works.  In a gasoline engine, the gasoline (a type of fossil fuel) is injected into a combustion chamber, where it is mixed with air. This mixture is then compressed by a piston and ignited by a spark plug. The resulting explosion from the ignited gasoline-air mix is what pushes the piston down, thus producing mechanical energy that powers the engine.  Therefore, using a gasoline engine essentially involves converting the chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy — essentially energy usage. Also, during this process, gasoline is consumed. Vaporization, adding heat, and evaporation are parts of the process, but they don't fully encompass the whole mechanic of how a gasoline engine operates.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible  for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe  in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure  of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. Question: What is the similar belief of the true competitors and those with a desire to fail?

Process:  - Prophase, the chromosomes become visible - Centrioles separate to move to opposite poles - Metaphase, the chromosomes line up in the center - Anaphase, the chromatids separate - Are pulled apart - Telophase, the chromosomes gather at opposite poles - Two new nuclear membranes form - The cell membranes pinch - Divide into two individual cells -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more basidia is available happens, how will it affect more anaphese happens.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"To understand the potential effect of the perturbation hypothesis, let's first break down the process of cell division and the role of basidia in this context. Cell division is a crucial biological process that occurs in living organisms to grow, repair, and maintain their tissues and organs. In eukaryotic cells, such as plants and animals, this process is known as mitosis. During mitosis, a cell replicates its genetic material, divides its cytoplasm and organelles, and ultimately forms two identical daughter cells. The process of mitosis can be divided into five main stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 1. Prophase: During this stage, the chromosomes condense and become visible under the microscope. The nucleolus disappears, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. The centrioles (only present in animal cells) start to separate and move towards the opposite poles of the cell. 2. Prometaphase: The nuclear membrane breaks down, and the spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of each chromosome, which are specialized protein structures located at the centromere. 3. Metaphase: The chromosomes, connected to the spindle fibers, line up at the equator of the cell, also known as the metaphase plate, to ensure equal and proper segregation of genetic material during cell division. 4. Anaphase: In this phase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell by the shortening of spindle fibers. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical copy of genetic material. 5. Telophase: During the final stage of mitosis, the chromosomes gather at the opposite poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, the spindle apparatus disassembles, and the nucleoli reappear. Cytokinesis follows, where the cell membrane pinches and divides the cytoplasm, ultimately separating and resulting in two individual daughter cells. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, in which more basidia are available. Basidia are specialized cells found in certain fungi, such as mushrooms and yeasts. They are involved in the production of spores for sexual reproduction. In this context, basidia are not directly associated with the process of mitosis or anaphase in eukaryotic cells; instead, they play a role in the reproduction of the fungal organism. So, assuming more basidia are available, the affected organism may have an increased capacity for spore production, leading to a higher probability of sexual reproduction and, potentially, a greater overall population size. However, this increase in basidia and subsequent spore production would not directly affect the process of anaphase during mitosis. In conclusion, although the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more basidia could have an impact on the sexual reproduction of certain fungi, it does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of anaphase during mitosis. The anaphase stage is mainly governed by molecular mechanisms and interactions within the eukaryotic cells, and an increased presence of basidia within a fungal organism would not directly influence this process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. During the 1991-92 season, West Indies played mainly one-day cricket, taking part in tournaments in Sharjah--where Ambrose took seven wickets, including an analysis of five for 53--and Australia, and took part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In this tournament, Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals. Ambrose returned home to play twice for the Leeward Islands in January 1992.  In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for the first time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, all of which were won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing regulation which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began the final day of the match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.  Returning to play for Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and suffering from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets at an average of 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games.","output":"This text is about Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, a former cricketer from Antigua who played for the West Indies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Six Chinese Communist Party investigators have been sentenced to between four and 14 years in jail after they drowned a local official during a botched interrogation that has shone light on China's secretive extrajudicial processes. Cheng Wenjie, the deputy director of the Commission for Discipline Inspection in the eastern city of Wenzhou, received the longest sentence of the six for his role in the death of Yu Qiyi, according to a copy of the court verdict given to CNN by the victim's wife. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Yu, 41, the chief engineer at a state-owned company in the same city, died at a local hospital on April 9, a month after being detained over his role in a land deal. When","output":"continuing this news story, the most logical completion would involve the subsequent consequences of the sentences, reactions from various parties, and measures taken by the Chinese government and public in response to the incident. When the news of the verdict broke, it sparked outrage and calls for justice from the victim's family, human rights organizations, and the public. Yu's wife, Li Xueling, and their two children start receiving support from their local community, including fundraising for their living expenses and the children's education. In response to the tragedy and the growing discontent, the central government announces an investigation into the extrajudicial practices employed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials. It pledges to review the existing disciplinary measures and implement reforms to ensure the rights and safety of those under investigation by the party. The incident further ignites heated discussions on social media platforms and local newspapers about the lack of transparency in China's legal system, urging for more openness in the criminal justice system and the accountability of CCP officials. Activists and human rights advocates capitalize on this momentum to push for abolishing extrajudicial detention centers, known as \\"shuanggui\\" or \\"liuzhi\\" facilities. These centers have long been criticized for being sites of abuse and torture. Simultaneously, several high-ranking CCP officials issue public apologies for the incident and promise to cooperate with the investigation. They vow to take measures, such as suspending or demoting officials linked to the case and implementing stricter guidelines pertaining to interrogations to avoid similar incidents in the future. These measures, they claim, would help restore public trust in the government's disciplinary system. Meanwhile, the Chinese Bar Association, along with other human rights NGOs, initiates a nationwide campaign to educate people about their rights during criminal investigations, aiming to prevent more extrajudicial abuses from taking place. They provide free legal aid to those who have suffered human rights abuses and lobby for the establishment of independent oversight over the CCP's disciplinary processes. While the public remains skeptical about the promised reforms, the case helps to start a broader conversation on human rights and justice in the country. As the government continues to face pressure coming from the citizenry and human rights organizations, some important steps are taken to improve the legal system and ensure that extrajudicial killings, like that of Yu Qiyi, are a thing of the past. With international attention focused on China's human rights issues, the Chinese government is forced to confront the problem and demonstrate that it is committed to addressing these concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The victory of the DPJ in the 2009 elections suggested the prospect of a significant warming in relations between Japan and China. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) winning the elections in 2009 did indeed indicate a potential improvement in the relationship between Japan and China. Prior to this victory, the political landscape in Japan had been dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for a long time. The LDP's approach to foreign policy matters had often been viewed as somewhat conservative and their relationship with China had consequently been strained in various aspects. The DPJ's victory represented a paradigm shift in Japanese politics, as the party promised a more open, progressive, and pragmatic approach to foreign policy. The election of the DPJ, under the leadership of Yukio Hatoyama, was perceived as a chance for both Japan and China to reassess their bilateral ties and seek common ground on various contentious issues. One of the key aspects of the DPJ's policy towards China included increased economic cooperation and pursuing stronger diplomatic ties. The DPJ proposed to move past historical and territorial disputes that had long plagued the relationship between the two nations, and instead focus on enhancing mutual trust and partnership.  Moreover, the DPJ's proposed foreign policy centered around the creation of an \\"East Asian community,\\" which would include both Japan and China, alongside other regional neighbors. This community would be built on the foundations of shared values and interests, with the ultimate aim of fostering regional peace, stability, and prosperity. In this context, the DPJ's victory in the 2009 elections indeed signaled a period of warming in the relationship between Japan and China. The leadership change brought with it an opportunity for renewed dialogue between the two countries, as well as greater potential for collaboration on regional issues and the development of strong, mutually-beneficial ties. However, it is important to note that the prospects of improving relations between Japan and China should be considered within a broader geopolitical context, which also includes economic competition, military rivalry, and other factors that naturally affect relations between neighboring countries. While the DPJ's victory in 2009 opened doors for greater cooperation and dialogue, it may not have been the sole factor in determining the future of the relationship between the two powerful nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Betrayal: Richard Hallam, 32, ordered drugs to bring on a miscarriage from China and then secretly administered them to his pregnant girlfriend. A cheating boyfriend who tried to abort his unborn child by secretly giving his pregnant partner miscarriage-inducing drugs has been jailed for 10 years. Richard Hallam, 32, had been seeing another woman when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant with a child he didn’t want. So he purchased an abortion drug called Mifemiso from a website in China, a court heard. While he waited for the drugs to arrive, his partner who can’t be named for legal reasons began suffering complications with the pregnancy. Hallam comforted her but the court heard he was also texting the company supplying the drug, saying he was ‘desperate’ to receive them. Hallam, from Poole, later gave his unsuspecting girlfriend the drug without her knowing. The horrified woman only discovered that she had taken it when she was later told by police who were investigating Hallam for an unconnected attack on another woman. The court was told Hallam had masterminded two savage hammer attacks on a fitness instructor his girlfriend suspected he was sleeping with. Kelly Batchelor, then 31, was hit on the head with a lump hammer by thugs Hallam hired in two separate attacks in Poole, Dorset. Hallam was arrested for ordering the attacks, carried out by three of his friends, andwas jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH at Winchester Crown Court. While police investigated Hallam for the attack, they discovered his plot to poison his unborn child. He pleaded guilty to one count of administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage and was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court. Both sentences are to run consecutively. Medication: It is not known whether the abortion drug - similar to that shown above - caused any damage to the unborn child or to Hallam's girlfriend's ability to have children. It is not known whether the tablets had any detrimental affect on his girlfriend’s unborn child or her ability to have children in the future. Rebecca Austin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court that Hallam began making inquiries into Mifemiso after his girlfriend told him she was pregnant last November. On November 9, Hallam began texting the drug supply firm in China. Miss Austin said: 'Messages were found on Hallam’s phone which were sent to a number, the dialling code of which suggested was in China. He sent a message saying, \\"Please try. I’m desperate\\".' Miss Austin continued: 'Hallam was arrested in relation to this offence where he made a comment to officers indicating that she had wanted him to give her \\"it\\", obviously a reference to the Mifemiso.' After Hallam's allegation his girlfriend had wanted to take the drug, she was also arrested by police, but denied having any knowledge of it and was released without charge. In court: Hallam was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court for administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage. The sentence will run consecutively with an eight year jail term for another crime. James Martin, defending, said: 'Mr Hallam had been taking a large amount of Valium and mixing it with alcohol, and it is right to say was not someone who was really in the right state of mind.' In sentencing Hallam for the poison plot, Judge John Harrow imposed an order to keep the victim anonymous because of the horror and trauma she has suffered. He told Hallam: 'You now admit administering drugs, intending to cause her to miscarry. 'I have to stress it cannot be established how many times you did this or whether it caused her to bleed. 'The effect of these events were clearly traumatic on (the victim) to say the least, not just what I am dealing with now but the fact that she was arrested twice. 'The case is serious, so much so that custody is inevitable because you put the life of anunborn child at risk.' Highlights:","output":"1.

Hallam was having an affair and had purchased the abortion drug Mifemiso from a website in China. 3.

Options: - feel pain - fly - pass water - die of cancer - feel pleasure  The answer is \\"pass water\\" because Answer:","output":"The animals were not thirsty, so when they were by the river, they chose to \\"pass water.\\" This option is logical and most relevant among the other options provided which include \\"feel pain,\\" \\"fly,\\" \\"die of cancer,\\" and \\"feel pleasure.\\" Here is a detailed explanation of why \\"pass water\\" is the most suitable choice. Thirst is a basic instinct that drives animals to seek out water for survival. But when animals are not thirsty, they may not have the same urge to drink. In this situation, their proximity to the river provides them with an opportunity to engage in other activities related to water, which in this case, is \\"pass water.\\" \\"Pass water\\" can be interpreted as the act of urinating, a natural bodily function essential for maintaining overall health and comfort of an animal. By selecting this option, the animals are engaging in a behavior that is necessary to preserve their well-being, and it aligns better with their needs than the other provided options. Let's analyze the other options briefly: 1. Feel pain: This option doesn't make much sense because there's no indication of the animals facing any injury or distress in the situation presented. It's not a direct consequence of being near the river. 2. Fly: Although some animals may possess the ability to fly, it is not directly related to the fact that they are by the river and not thirsty. Flying doesn't provide a clear explanation for how the animals utilize their time by the river. 3. Die of cancer: This option is not relevant to the question, as cancer is a complex disease and not an immediate result of animals being near a river. It's inappropriate and doesn't offer any logical connection with the given scenario. 4. Feel pleasure: While it is possible for animals to feel pleasure, it is not specifically linked to the fact that they are by the river and not thirsty. The term \\"feel pleasure\\" is also notably vague and needs more context in order to be considered a direct, clear response to the question. In conclusion, the answer \\"pass water\\" is the most logical choice among the options provided. It pertains to a natural and essential behavior that animals may exhibit when they are near a source of water, even if they are not feeling thirsty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The single was released on May 4 , 2007 as a 12 \`\` vinyl . There are three different editions of the single ; a red version , a white version and a blue version each containing a different B - side . The song features a blues - influenced beat produced by Ant to assist its '' bitingly critical \`\` lyrics . Its lyrics harshly condemn the United States government for its past involvement in slavery and the crack cocaine trade , and its failure to provide for the poor . Its music video contains controversial images of cross burning , lynching and police brutality alongside images of American landmarks like the White House and Capitol building . Brother Ali has been under pressure from the recording industry due to lyrics from this song , claiming creative interference from '' somebody I do n't wan na name , but some of you probably has their cell phones . \`\` The unnamed corporation ultimately withdrew its sponsorship of Ali , causing him to truncate parts of his 2007 tour . Furthermore , on the song '' Second Time Around \`\` with Benzi and Wale , Ali makes references to being kicked off a tour followed by the line '' Verizon dissed me too , cuz I was too political . \`\` The song is notably critical of the United States government , with accusations that the political system is addicted to war . The introduction , in which Brother Ali says , '' The name of this song is Uncle Sam Goddamn . It 's a show tune , but the show ai n't been written for it yet , \`\` is an allusion to Nina Simone 's '' Mississippi Goddam . \`\`  - A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other.

Angels are shown similar veneration in many religions. Philologically, \\"to venerate\\" derives from the Latin verb, \\"venerare\\", meaning to regard with reverence and respect. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism.  - Cross burning or cross lighting is a practice widely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, although the historical practice long predates the Klan's inceptionas far back as Peter of Bruys (11171131), who burned crosses in protest of the veneration of crosses. In the early 20th century, the Klan burned crosses on hillsides or near the homes of those they wished to intimidate.  - The White House is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the United States, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

The sentence states: Jake stopped to grab a waffle before going to the bus station for his meeting, fortunately he had plenty of time because the... Now, I will review the options: [1]. bus was late.. [2]. meeting was late.. In this context, Jake is going to the bus station for his meeting. It is mentioned that he had plenty of time, so the reason for having extra time should be related to either the bus or the meeting.  Option 1 focuses on the bus being late, which would be a reason for Jake to have more time before needing to catch the bus. This appears to be a logical and suitable choice. Option 2 focuses on the meeting being late. Although this would give Jake more time before the meeting, it doesn't address the transportation aspect, which is the bus in this case. This choice is somewhat relevant, but not as directly tied to the situation as option 1. After analyzing both options, I believe that the most appropriate choice is option 1, as it is directly related to the transportation aspect of Jake's journey. So, the complete sentence would be: Jake stopped to grab a waffle before going to the bus station for his meeting, fortunately he had plenty of time because the bus was late."},{"instruction":"Choices: 1. 800 miles in 10 days.. 2. not enough information. 3.

Context: Despite my blog name, I’m not actually all that adventurous. Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn’t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures. It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway). DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

Joel does not eat meat or fish.","output":"(1) Eric does not eat meat or fish. Eric and Joel's friendship began when they were kids, growing up in the same neighborhood and attending the same school. Each of them was passionate about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Their unique dietary preferences played a crucial role in shaping their lives. Eric, the vegetarian, excluded meat and fish from his diet, while Joel, the pescatarian, avoided meat but allowed seafood. Throughout their childhood, Eric and Joel enjoyed learning about their respective dietary choices and incorporating that knowledge into their everyday life. Eric chose to follow a vegetarian diet for numerous reasons, including health, environmental, animal welfare, and spiritual beliefs. The vegetarian lifestyle provided him with a platform for expanding his culinary skills and discovering new, flavorful ways of experiencing plant-based food. As Eric grew older, his commitment to vegetarianism grew stronger. He educated himself on the nutrients needed for a balanced diet and protein sources that would substitute meat. These included lentils, chickpeas, tempeh, soy, and quinoa, to name a few. Combining these ingredients with fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, Eric would craft nutritious and delicious meals that satisfied his cravings and provided him with ample energy for his active lifestyle. On the other hand, Joel adopted a pescatarian diet for different reasons. He had read numerous studies on the health benefits of consuming fish that were high in Omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and trout. Joel's interest in nutrition and fitness led him to adopt this diet, which he believed would help him build lean muscle, maintain a healthy heart, and support overall mental well-being. Despite their different dietary choices, Eric and Joel shared a common goal that extended beyond the realm of personal health. They both cherished their connection to the planet and were eager to contribute toward a more sustainable future. As advocates of the value of community-supported agriculture and farmers markets, the two would often visit local outlets to buy fresh, organic produce for their meals. This shared passion for sustainability and healthy living fostered a strong bond between them that lasted well into their adult lives. Their friendship occasionally led to engaging discussions and debates on various topics. For instance, one day, Eric and Joel decided to challenge each other to a cooking contest. The objective was to create a meal that incorporated elements from both vegetarian and pescatarian diets, thus demonstrating the versatility of plant-based foods. The resulting fusion dish—a vegetable stir-fry with seared scallops, topped wiťh a miso-ginger glaze—showcased their culinary skills and mutual respect for each other's dietary choices. Drawing strength from their friendship, Eric and Joel would often collaborate on community projects, raising awareness of the importance of environmentally-conscious diets. They volunteered at local food banks, led cooking classes, and taught others the value of incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods into their regimen. In sharing their personal stories, both Eric and Joel found strength in their choice of dietary lifestyle. Fueled by their life experiences, Eric's vegetarianism and Joel's pescatarianism became a core part of their identity. While they may have chosen to exclude one or more aspects of a typical omnivorous diet, this never stopped them from living life to the fullest. Consequently, their friendship became an encapsulation of the belief that with an open mind and a creative spirit, even the most different individuals can forge a lifelong bond and make a difference in the world."},{"instruction":"Question: what is human skin made of?

You may also try a partially liquid diet during a flare-up.. d. You may need to drink 500 to 300 mg of liquid daily. Even a lower dosage of liquid must not cause any inflammation to the bowel.. The answer is:","output":"c. It is sometimes used after surgery, as well. You may also try a partially liquid diet during a flare-up. Explanation: A liquid diet can be used after surgery to help with healing and also during a flare-up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to give the bowel some rest. This is the best option among the choices given because it can be applied during recovery or a flare-up. a) This option is not entirely correct because liquid diets are typically temporary, not a long-term solution to stop inflammation. b) This option is not suitable because it mentions Tums, which are antacids unrelated to a liquid diet. Drinking water is essential, but it's not the main focus of a liquid diet for IBD. d) This option is incorrect because it uses an incorrect dosage. Liquid diets typically require more than 500 to 300 mg daily.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Sentence from a movie review: a tarantino movie with heart  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given phrase from the movie review, it is likely that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer. Describing a movie as \\"a Tarantino movie with heart\\" suggests that the film has some of the distinctive features commonly associated with Quentin Tarantino's works, but it also possesses an emotional depth or a strong character-driven narrative that sets it apart. Quentin Tarantino is known for his unique storytelling style filled with intricate plots, non-linear narratives, witty dialogues, stylized violence, and a mix of different film genres. His movies generally receive positive reviews and have a cult following, so the comparison to a Tarantino movie could be a compliment in itself. The addition of \\"with heart\\" in the review is crucial in understanding the positive connotation of the comment. This phrase implies that the movie goes beyond the usual Tarantino trademarks and offers a deeper sense of emotion, empathy, or connection with the characters. When a film is described as having \\"heart,\\" it often means that it manages to evoke strong emotions in the viewer. It can relate to powerful performances, relatable character arcs, or a thought-provoking script that goes beyond the surface level spectacle while still providing a good dose of entertainment. In conclusion, considering the reference to Tarantino's style and the mention of \\"heart\\", the sentence most likely comes from a positive review of the movie. The reviewer seems to appreciate the film's balance between Tarantino-esque elements and its emotional core, which ultimately results in a satisfying and engaging viewing experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

After being dumped during his 16th season because he was no longer pretty enough and suddenly cost too much, Fisher could have gone anywhere from remote Houston to distant Miami but decided instead to drop his bags in the one place that currently shadows the Lakers, taunts the Lakers, and could eventually roll over and crush the Lakers. Look across the yard and cover your eyes, Lakers fans. Yes, D-Fish is really in OKC. A week after being shipped out, Fisher is back and bigger than ever, signing with an Oklahoma City team that has become the Lakers' most serious rival and roadblock in returning to the In attempting to wipe away the guy like a bad dream, the Lakers only empowered him to become their biggest nightmare. \\"I think it's perfect,\\" Lakers center Oh, it's perfect, all right.

People think this might make things difficult for the Lakers if they have to play against Derek Fisher's new team in an important game. Derek Fisher chose to wear the number 37 on his jersey, which is his age, to show that he can still be a good player and help his team win even if he's older."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge?  Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

The term \\"post-punk\\" was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas. Many of these artists, initially inspired by punk's DIY ethic and energy, ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement, feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody. They repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity, instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition, subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences. Artists moved beyonds punk's focus on the concerns of a largely white, male, working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes, such as three-chord progressions and Chuck Berry-based guitar riffs. These artists instead defined punk as \\"an imperative to constant change\\", believing that \\"radical content demands radical form\\". What dis the new term, post-punk, cover?","output":"The new term, \\"post-punk\\", covered a diverse range of music styles and artists who emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These artists moved beyond the punk rock sound and ideology, exploring innovative and experimental approaches to music. Here are the key elements of post-punk: 1. Musical evolution: Post-punk artists sought to break with musical tradition, incorporating unconventional instruments, sounds, and song structures. This experimentation led to a wide array of musical styles, including gothic rock, industrial, synth-pop, and noise rock. 2. Rejection of punk rock clichés: Disillusioned with the commercialization and formulaic nature of punk rock, post-punk artists distanced themselves from the movement's emphasis on accessibility, raw simplicity, and reliance on established rock tropes. Instead, they embraced complexity, innovation, and a desire to challenge audiences. 3. Ideological diversity: Post-punk artists expanded the scope of punk's primarily white, male, working-class concerns to address broader cultural, social, and political issues. This shift enabled artists to subvert commonplaces and engage in a deeper exploration of their subject matter. 4. Constant change: Post-punk artists viewed punk as \\"an imperative to constant change,\\" driven by the belief that radical content demanded radical form. This approach enabled them to push the boundaries of traditional music genres and create unique, ground-breaking styles. In summary, the term \\"post-punk\\" covers a wide range of artists and music styles that emerged after the initial punk rock movement, characterized by a rejection of punk's commercialized and formulaic aspects, a commitment to experimentation, and a focus on diverse subject matters and ideologies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She discovered cleaning the bathroom floor could be done at the same time as the rest by sliding around with wet towels tied to her feet. This is likely to work better than dry towels because wet towels provide (A) less resistance or (B) more resistance?.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"wet towels\\" and  \\"dry towels\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"wet towels\\" and \\"dry towels\\" for cleaning the bathroom floor while sliding around would be wet towels. Let's break down the reasoning behind this choice: If the objective is to perform chores quickly and efficiently, it is important to consider how well each method accomplishes the task. In this case, the chore is cleaning the bathroom floor. When cleaning a surface like a bathroom floor, it is common to use a combination of water, soap, and friction to remove dirt, grime, and any other contaminants. The water and soap help to dissolve and break down the dirt and grime, while friction in the form of scrubbing or wiping assists in dislodging it from the surface.  Wet towels have several advantages over dry towels in this regard: 1. Wetness: A wet towel already has the necessary water content needed to help dissolve the dirt and grime on the bathroom floor. The moist nature of the towel helps to lift and remove particles more effectively than a dry towel, which would simply push dirt around without picking it up as effectively. 2. Friction: Wet towels generally provide more resistance or friction when sliding across a surface as compared to dry towels. This increased resistance allows for a more efficient scrubbing effect, helping to remove dirt and grime from the floor more effectively. In addition, the added weight of the water in the towel also helps to create more pressure between the towel and floor, further enhancing the cleaning process. 3. Soap distribution: A wet towel can more easily distribute soap across the floor, if that is desired for a deeper clean. Since the towel is already damp, any soap or cleaning solution applied to it can spread effectively on the floor surface. In comparison, dry towels have these disadvantages: 1. Less effective cleaning: As mentioned above, dry towels lack the necessary water content to dissolve dirt and grime effectively, which makes them less efficient at picking up and removing contaminants from the floor. 2. Less friction: Dry towels slide more effortlessly on surfaces and provide less resistance, which makes them less effective in scrubbing away dirt and grime from the floor. 3. Inability to distribute soap: Dry towels cannot distribute soap or cleaning solutions effectively across the floor, limiting their ability to provide a thorough clean. Considering these factors, wet towels are the more sensical choice for cleaning the bathroom floor while sliding around. They provide enhanced cleaning capabilities as compared to dry towels, enabling Sara to complete her chores more effectively and faster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hooper was born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California. His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with Tris Speaker (CF) and Duffy Lewis (LF) to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic.  Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker's tough exterior. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the \\"rump-slide\\" for catching shallow fly balls.  In 1910 Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of eleven consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league-high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis and Speaker hit .315 combined.  Hooper's batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch that The Pittsburgh Press referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The paper noted that Hooper \\"does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.\\" On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson and Brady Anderson over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders.  On October 13, 1915, in game five of the 1915 World Series, he became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Duffy contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919. Hooper became known for talking Boston manager Ed Barrow into converting Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder. what did Hooper do for Red Sox?","output":"Hooper was a baseball player who played for the Red Sox team. He played in the outfield and was part of a group called the Golden Outfield, which was known as one of the best outfield groups in baseball history. Hooper was a strong defensive player in right field and a good hitter when he was at bat. He also made some very impressive catches during games, like the one in the 1912 World Series, which helped the team win championships. He was a team captain in 1919, and he even talked the team manager into changing Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder. So, Hooper did a lot to help the Red Sox team play better and win games."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It says demand for emergency parcels for children rose significantly - by more than 4,000 - last July and August. The government said it was helping families meet the cost of living. Figures from the Trussell Trust show 67,506 three-day emergency food supplies were provided for children by its network in July and August 2016, compared with 63,094 in the May and June  - an increase of 4,412 parcels. The trust says nearly half (47%) of those 67,506 parcels went to primary-school-age children and over a quarter (27%) to children aged four and under. It says, while it welcomes the government's decision to keep free school meals for infants in England, more must be done to help struggling families during the holidays. Samantha Stapley, operations manager for England at The Trussell trust, said: \\"Over a third of all the food distributed by food banks in our network consistently goes to children, but these new figures show five- to 11-year-olds are more likely than other children to receive a food bank's help. \\"This highlights just how close to crisis many families are living - as a nation, we also must address the reasons why families with children are referred to food banks in the first place. \\"We welcome the government's decision to maintain free school lunches for children during term time - the next step must be to help families during the holidays. \\"Food banks are doing more than ever before, but voluntary organisations alone cannot stop primary school children facing hunger.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \\"Employment remains the best route out of poverty. \\"Record numbers of people are now in work, and we're helping millions of households meet the everyday cost of living and keep more of what they earn. \\"We've doubled free childcare to help parents into work, and continue to spend over Â£90bn a year on support for those who need it, including those who are bringing up a family or on a low income. \\"Budgeting advice and benefit advances are also available for anyone who needs more help.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Trussell Trust, a UK-based organization that operates over 420 food banks, has raised concerns about the possibility of many children facing hunger during the six-week school break.

Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament.

Nevertheless, when your telephone stops working, it can cause significant inconvenience. In some cases, you may even need to call in a professional to fix the problem. However, before you take that step, there are some simple troubleshooting techniques you can follow to determine the issue and potentially resolve it on your own. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you identify and fix common telephone problems. Step 1: Unplug the phone that doesn't work If you suspect that your telephone has stopped working, the first step is to unplug the device from the wall jack. This allows you to verify if the problem exists within the phone itself or if it's related to an external factor, such as the wiring or wall jack. Step 2: Find a phone in the house that works Once you have unplugged the non-working phone, locate another phone in your house that is functioning correctly. This phone will serve as a reference point, allowing you to compare and test with the non-working phone. Step 3: Swap the working and non-working phones Unplug the working phone and its cord from the wall jack. Next, plug in the non-working phone using the same cord and wall jack. By doing this, you can determine if the problem is with the phone itself or if it's related to the wall jack or phone cord. Step 4: Check for a dial tone After connecting the non-working phone to the working phone's wall jack and cord, lift the receiver and listen for a dial tone. If there is a dial tone, the issue was likely with the original wall jack or phone cord. If there is still no dial tone, it's likely that the problem lies with the phone itself. Step 5: Try a different phone cord If the non-working phone still doesn't have a dial tone, try swapping out the phone cord for another one. A damaged or faulty cord can often be the root of the problem. If, after testing with a different cord, the phone starts working, you have successfully narrowed down the issue and resolved it. Step 6: Consider repairing the wall jack If none of the steps above have resolved the issue, it's possible that the problem lies with the wall jack. In this case, you may need to bring in a professional technician to examine the wiring and wall jack. Ensure that you take proper safety precautions when dealing with electrical components, and if you're uncertain about any step, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Conclusion: Troubleshooting telephone issues can be a simple process if you follow these step-by-step instructions. By testing various components such as the phone, phone cord, and wall jack, you can effectively narrow down the root cause of the problem. In many cases, you'll be able to resolve the issue on your own, saving time and money. However, if you're unable to determine the source of the problem or feel uncomfortable handling electrical components, it's always best to call in a professional for assistance."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

And I was wondering How would Kendall feel afterwards? Options: I. sad; II. accomplished; III. bored; Answer:","output":"It is difficult to predict exactly how Kendall will feel following their decision to move to a new city for a better job, as emotions can be complex and multifaceted. However, I can provide an in-depth analysis of each of the provided options and their likelihood based on various factors and circumstances. I. Sad Kendall might experience sadness after moving to a new city for a better job for several reasons. Firstly, they might miss their family, friends, and the familiarity of their old surroundings. Adjusting to a new environment and building new social connections can be challenging and may lead to feelings of loneliness. Moreover, despite having a better job, Kendall may not be satisfied with other aspects of their life or even feel overwhelmed by the increased workload or pressure in their new role. It is also possible that their expectations for the new job were too high and the reality does not meet those expectations, leading to disappointment and sadness. II. Accomplished There is a high potential for Kendall to feel accomplished after moving to a new city for a better job. This decision demonstrates a willingness to take risks, seize opportunities, and make proactive choices to improve their life. If the new job offers better compensation, more interesting work, or a stronger sense of purpose, Kendall is likely to feel a sense of achievement in making the choice to pursue it. Moreover, successfully adapting to a new environment and building a new social network can also contribute to feelings of accomplishment. It can take time and effort, but it will be rewarding once Kendall feels established in the new city. III. Bored The likelihood of Kendall feeling bored after making this life change is relatively low, but it is still possible depending on factors such as their personality, interests, and hobbies. Moving to a new city and starting a new job will likely present Kendall with numerous challenges and stimuli that will occupy their time and energy, reducing the likelihood of boredom. However, if the new city does not have the same recreational options or community events that Kendall enjoyed in their old city, they might feel bored in their spare time. Additionally, if the new job is not engaging or fulfilling, Kendall may find themselves bored at work. In conclusion, it is impossible to predict with certainty which emotion would be dominant for Kendall after moving to a new city for a better job. It is likely that they would experience a mix of emotions, including sadness, accomplishment, and even boredom at different times throughout their transition. Adjusting to a new environment, overcoming challenges, and finding long-term satisfaction in their new life would significantly influence Kendall's emotional state."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: He was climbing higher and higher, what was he scared of as he got higher?

The food, although well-presented, fell short in quality. My entree, which was supposed to be a specialty, tasted bland and lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. Additionally, my companion's dish felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long, as it was dried out and overcooked. The ambience of the restaurant was not much better. The lighting was excessively bright, creating a harsh atmosphere that made it difficult to relax and enjoy our meal. To make matters worse, the tables were situated far too close to one another, leaving little room for privacy or conversation. Lastly, the cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. The restroom was poorly maintained and lacked basic necessities such as soap and paper towels. This made us question the overall hygiene standards of the establishment. Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant and am unlikely to return. The combination of subpar service, underwhelming food, and an uncomfortable atmosphere left us feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with our dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the new issue of Rolling Stone, contributing editor Janet Reitman delivers a deeply reported account of the life and times of Boston bomber Jahar Tsarnaev. Reitman spent the last two months interviewing dozens of sources – childhood and high school friends, teachers, neighbors and law enforcement agents, many of whom spoke for the first time about the case – to deliver a riveting and heartbreaking account of how a charming kid with a bright future became a monster. Here are five revelations about Tsarnaev from our latest cover story, \\"Jahar's World\\":      Dropkick Murphys Donate 300,000 to Boston Victims      • As Jahar lay in the boat, surrounded by SWAT teams and police, FBI negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach. An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced Jahar to ultimately give up.      • Around 2008, Jahar’s older brother Tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like \\"two people\\" were inside him. She confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist, but Zubeidat believed that religion would be the cure for her son’s inner demons and growing mental instability, and pushed him deeper into Islam.      • Jahar's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, is famously diverse, but Jahar played down the fact that he was a Muslim. As his brother and mother became more religious, he did, however, attend a small Friday prayer group that met at lunchtime, and once got quite upset when a friend who'd converted to Islam talked about it in a casual way. \\"Islam wasn't casual to Jahar,\\" says one friend. \\"He took his religion seriously.\\"      • Jahar shared few details of his troubled home life with even his closest friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated. His parents were both living in Russia. His two older sisters were estranged. Only Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout and judgmental of all non-Muslims, was still in Boston. When one of Jahar’s friends asked to meet Tamerlan, Jahar said, \\"No, you don't want to meet him.\\"      • Jahar never spoke about 9/11. Once, though, he let slip to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, and pointed to US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes and other attacks as his rationale. ||||| The August issue of Rolling Stone hasn't even hit newstands yet, but its cover is already stirring up controversy on social media.      On the front of the magazine is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving member of the duo of brothers alleged to have carried out the attacks on the Boston Marathon.      Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured in the blasts.      The cover story is titled \\"Jahar's World\\" and is described as \\"a riveting and heartbreaking account of how a charming kid with a bright future became a monster.\\"      Not surprising is the swift — and mostly negative — reaction to the cover's depiction of Tsarnaev, and Rolling Stone is already taking plenty of heat on its Facebook page.      Here's some of the reaction so far:      \\"Why give the guy the cover of Rolling Stone? TIME gave Charles Manson the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the Columbine shooters on the covers, too. Don't make martyrs out of these people.\\"      ...      \\"Very un-American. F--k you Rolling Stone. I thought it was supposed to be an honor to be on your cover?\\"      ...      \\"I shared this on my news feed, but not in support of your magazine, I shared it to show people how low you have gone by putting this terrorist on your cover. Rolling Stone, go and read all the shares of your picture, there are a lot of angry people that you would make such a disgusting choice.\\"      It should be noted that this isn't the first time the Tsarnaev \\"selfie\\" has made its way onto a front page. The New York Times ran it on May 5:      That Dzhokhar selfie on the Rolling Stone cover was everywhere at the time. It was on the front page of the Times! pic.twitter.com/ix0KreMst7 — Stefan Becket (@stefanjbecket) July 17, 2013      On the other hand, this is Rolling Stone. The implied comparison of a suspected terrorist to rock stars, pop culture icons, and celebrities is striking – and distressing – to many. |||||","output":"In a recent issue of Rolling Stone, contributing editor Janet Reitman provides a detailed account of the life and times of Boston bomber Jahar Tsarnaev, interviewing numerous sources, including friends, teachers, neighbors, and law enforcement agents. The article, entitled \\"Jahar's World,\\" offers insights into how Tsarnaev transformed from a charming and bright individual into a dangerous terrorist.  Key revelations from the article include:  1. During the standoff in which FBI negotiators attempted to coax Jahar to surrender, a mention of his former wrestling coach may have been the trigger that convinced him to give up.  2. Around 2008, Jahar's older brother Tamerlan expressed to their mother that he felt like \\"two people\\" were inside of him. Their mother believed that religion could cure her son’s inner demons and mental instability, pushing him deeper into Islam.  3. Jahar's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, was notably diverse. Although he downplayed his Muslim identity, he attended a small Friday prayer group during lunchtime. His commitment to Islam was demonstrated when he became upset upon hearing a conversation about religion being discussed casually. 4. Jahar seldom shared the details of his unstable home life with close friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated, with his parents living in Russia and his two older sisters estranged. Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout, was the only family member still in Boston. 5. Jahar never mentioned 9/11, but once admitted to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, citing US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes as a rationale. The Rolling Stone cover featuring Tsarnaev led to controversy and sparked negative reactions on social media. Critics expressed their disappointment with the magazine for making a martyr out of the terrorist and questioned the honor of being featured on the cover of Rolling Stone."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One night, when Johnny couldn't sleep, he saw a small light flickering outside his window. He was curious, so he went to the window and discovered a tiny magical fairy named Flicker. Flicker was a Flashlight Fairy, and her job was to help people who were scared of the dark. Flicker said, \\"Hi, Johnny! I know you're scared of the dark, so I'm here to give you a flashlight to help you feel safe at night.\\" Johnny was very happy and thanked Flicker. Every night, Flicker would visit Johnny and give him more flashlights to help him feel even safer. Johnny's room became full of flashlights, big and small, of all different shapes and colors. Johnny was amazed by all the different types of flashlights Flicker brought him. Soon, Johnny had so many flashlights that they started spilling out of his room and he had to store them in other parts of his house. The flashlights were in the kitchen, the living room, and even the bathroom. Johnny's family started calling him \\"Flashlight Master.\\" One day, while playing in the park, Johnny met a new friend named Melissa. Melissa was also scared of the dark, so Johnny decided to share one of his flashlights with her. They became the best of friends, and they both felt safer because they had each other and their trusty flashlights. Eventually, Johnny became brave enough to not be scared of the dark anymore. He thought to himself, \\"I have so many flashlights, maybe I can help other kids who are scared of the dark too!\\" So, Johnny started giving away his flashlights to kids who needed them more than he did. But no matter how many flashlights Johnny gave away, Flicker kept bringing him more and more. Johnny told Flicker, \\"Thank you, but I'm not scared of the dark anymore.\\" Flicker was very happy for Johnny and said, \\"That's wonderful! I'm glad I could help you face your fear.\\" As a farewell gift, Flicker decided to give Johnny one final flashlight — the most special and magical flashlight of all. This flashlight could change colors and played calming music to help Johnny sleep at night. Flicker flew away, and Johnny waved goodbye, feeling both thankful and a little sad. He realized that his magical friend had helped make his house brighter than ever. But now Johnny had a new problem to solve: My house is now full of flashlights I don't know what to do with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That was obvious in November. It was obvious in April when Facebook, to its credit, announced some moves to combat the spread of lies in the form of news stories.      It's even more obvious now after Wednesday's news that Facebook sold ads during the campaign to a Russian \\"troll farm,\\" targeting American voters with \\"divisive social and political messages\\" that fit right in with Donald Trump's campaign strategy.      The news, reported Wednesday by The Washington Post, fits right in with the findings of a fascinating recent study by Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. Analyzing reams of data, it documented the huge role that propaganda, in various forms, played in the 2016 campaign.      \\"Attempts by the [Hillary] Clinton campaign to define her campaign on competence, experience, and policy positions were drowned out by coverage of alleged improprieties associated with the Clinton Foundation and emails,\\" the study said.      The Trump campaign masterfully manipulated these messages. Truth was not a requirement.      And Facebook was the indispensable messenger. As the Harvard study noted: \\"Disproportionate popularity on Facebook is a strong indicator of highly partisan and unreliable media.\\"      We don't know everything about Facebook's role in the campaign. What we do know — or certainly ought to know by now — is to not take Facebook at its word. It always plays down its influence, trying for a benign image of connecting us all in a warm bath of baby pictures, tropical vacations and games of Candy Crush.      The company recently changed its mission statement, as John Lanchester noted in a blistering takedown in the London Review of Books, mocking the \\"canting pieties\\" of such corporate efforts. What used to be just a soft ideal of \\"making the world more open and connected\\" is now giving people \\"the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\\"      The new mission statement didn't specifically mention bringing Russia and the United States closer together. But Facebook managed to accomplish that anyway.      Here's an undeniable fact: Facebook is about advertising. And it is so wildly successful at leveraging our eyeballs and spending power into ad dollars that it is now valued at nearly 500 billion.      But for all its power and wealth, Facebook is a terribly opaque enterprise. (It recently hired former New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, a former Post managing editor, to help with \\"transparency.\\" Let's just say that she has her work cut out for her.)      Facebook also has never acknowledged the glaringly obvious — that it is essentially a media company, where many of its 2 billion active monthly users get the majority of their news and information. As I've been pointing out here for more than a year, it constantly makes editorial decisions, but never owns them.      When its information is false, when it is purchased and manipulated to affect the outcome of an election, the effect is enormous. When the information purveyors are associated with a foreign adversary — with a clear interest in the outcome of the American election — we're into a whole new realm of power.      Would Donald Trump be president today if Facebook didn't exist? Although there is a long list of reasons for his win, there's increasing reason to believe the answer is no.      I don't know how to deal with Facebook's singular power in the world. But having everyone clearly acknowledge it — including the company itself — would be a start.

The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites — 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook — means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.      Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day — including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting — but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the “civic content” posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one percent resulted from “information operations” like the Russian campaign.      Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a “trends” list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.      Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a “bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms.” But he added that while Facebook “has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,” Twitter has done little and as a result, “bots have only spread since the election.”      Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was “doubling down” on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company’s measures. But it declared that Twitter’s “open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote” to falsehoods.      “This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,” the statement said. “We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.” ||||| Figure 1: Number of sentences by topic and candidate from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016      Attempts by the Clinton campaign to define her campaign on competence, experience, and policy positions were drowned out by coverage of alleged improprieties associated with the Clinton Foundation and emails. Coverage of Trump associated with immigration, jobs, and trade was greater than that on his personal scandals.      Immigration and Muslims/Islam were the two most widely covered substantive issues of the campaign.      Figure 2: Number of sentences by substantive topic and candidate from media on the open web Immigration emerged as the leading substantive issue of the campaign. Initially, the Trump campaign used a hard-line anti-immigration stance to distinguish Trump from the field of GOP contenders. Later, immigration was a wedge issue between the left and the right. Pro-Trump media sources supported this with sensationalistic, race-centric coverage of immigration focused on crime, terrorism, fear of Muslims, and disease. While coverage of his candidacy was largely critical, Trump dominated media coverage.      Figure 3: Valence and focus of the 100 most linked-to stories. Stories were hand-coded for topic and tone. The media landscape is distinctly asymmetric.            The structure of the overall media landscape shows media systems on the left and right operate differently. The asymmetric polarization of media is evident in both open web linking and social media sharing measures. Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left. On the right, prominent media are highly partisan.      Figure 4: Partisan distribution of top 250 most-linked-to media sources by total inlinks* *“Inlinks” refers to the incoming cross-media hyperlinks to stories and media sources. Twitter is a more partisan environment than the open web media landscape.      Figure 5: Partisan distribution of top 250 media sites by Twitter shares Facebook is more partisan than Twitter.      Figure 6: Partisan distribution of top 250 media sites by Facebook shares From all of these perspectives, conservative media is more partisan and more insular than the left. The center-left and the far right are the principal poles of the media landscape.      The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum.            Figure 7: Network map based on open web media from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 (explore this map in higher resolution) Conservative media disrupted.      Breitbart emerges as the nexus of conservative media. The Wall Street Journal is treated by social media users as centrist and less influential. The rising prominence of Breitbart along with relatively new outlets such as the Daily Caller marks a significant reshaping of the conservative media landscape over the past several years.

On the left, the Huffington Post, MSNBC, and Vox are prominent on all platforms. On the right, Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Caller, and the New York Post are popular across platforms.      Table 1: Most popular media on the right from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016      Table 2: Most popular media on the left from May 1, 2015, to November 7, 2016 On the most widely covered topic of the election, immigration, Breitbart was the most prominent site. On Twitter, it is far above the rest.      Figure 10: Network map based on Twitter sharing for the topic of immigration (explore this map in higher resolution) Breitbart’s key role in the media landscape during the election was particularly pronounced in coverage of immigration. On Twitter, Breitbart stories on immigration were shared more than twice as often as stories from the Guardian, which ranked second. Disinformation and propaganda are rooted in partisanship and are more prevalent on social media.            The most obvious forms of disinformation are most prevalent on social media and in the most partisan fringes of the media landscape. Greater popularity on social media than attention from media peers is a strong indicator of reporting that is partisan and, in some cases, dubious.            Among the set of top 100 media sources by inlinks or social media shares, seven sources, all from the partisan right or partisan left, receive substantially more attention on social media than links from other media outlets. These sites do not necessarily all engage in misleading or false reporting, but they are clearly highly partisan. In this group, Gateway Pundit is in a class of its own, known for “publishing falsehoods and spreading hoaxes.”      Disproportionate popularity on Facebook is a strong indicator of highly partisan and unreliable media.            A distinct set of websites receive a disproportionate amount of attention from Facebook compared with Twitter and media inlinks. From the list of the most prominent media, 13 sites fall into this category. Many of these sites are cited by independent sources and media reporting as progenitors of inaccurate if not blatantly false reporting. Both in form and substance, the majority of these sites are aptly described as political clickbait. Again, this does not imply equivalency across these sites. Ending the Fed is often cited as the prototypical example of a media source that published false stories. The Onion is an outlier in this group, in that it is explicitly satirical and ironic, rather than, as is the case with the others, engaging in highly partisan and dubious reporting without explicit irony. ||||| Media columnist      What a ridiculous notion, Mark Zuckerberg scoffed shortly after the election, that his social-media company — innocent, well-intentioned Facebook — could have helped Donald Trump's win.      \\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook . . . influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,\\" he said. \\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\\"      In fact, voters make their decisions based on many factors, not just their \\"lived experience.\\"      Disinformation spread on Facebook clearly was one — a big one.

But for all its power and wealth, Facebook is a terribly opaque enterprise. (It recently hired former New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, a former Post managing editor, to help with \\"transparency.\\" Let's just say that she has her work cut out for her.)      Facebook also has never acknowledged the glaringly obvious — that it is essentially a media company, where many of its 2 billion active monthly users get the majority of their news and information. As I've been pointing out here for more than a year, it constantly makes editorial decisions, but never owns them.      When its information is false, when it is purchased and manipulated to affect the outcome of an election, the effect is enormous. When the information purveyors are associated with a foreign adversary — with a clear interest in the outcome of the American election — we're into a whole new realm of power.      Would Donald Trump be president today if Facebook didn't exist? Although there is a long list of reasons for his win, there's increasing reason to believe the answer is no.      I don't know how to deal with Facebook's singular power in the world. But having everyone clearly acknowledge it — including the company itself — would be a start.

In addition to the spread of false news stories, Facebook has also recently admitted that it sold ads to a Russian “troll farm”, which targeted voters with “divisive social and political messages”."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ann-Marie Answer:","output":"Title: The Light within the Shadow Genre: Drama/Thriller Plot Overview: Charlie, a reclusive and introverted locksmith, has a mundane and predictable routine in a small coastal town where everyone knows each other. When a mysterious and enigmatic woman named Ann-Marie arrives in town, her presence disrupts the familiar pattern of life, and she captures Charlie's attention. What unfolds next is a gripping tale of secrets, redemption, and love, in which Charlie and Ann-Marie must come to terms with their past in order to save each other and, ultimately, themselves. Act I: We begin with Charlie's routine - he wakes up every day, has a monotonous job at his locksmith store, and often spends his evenings alone, engrossed in his love for mystery novels and cryptic puzzles. The town is charming, and people are warm, but Charlie's peculiar choice to keep to himself doesn't sit well with the community. However, they still grudgingly seek Charlie's help for all their lock-related issues. Things change when Ann-Marie arrives in town. With her sophisticated aura, she sparks curiosity as she moves into an old, abandoned house that carries a mysterious past. The whole town is abuzz with speculation and gossip. Charlie, too, is enamored by her presence and, despite his introverted personality, decides to introduce himself under the pretext of helping Ann-Marie change the old locks on her house. Act II: When Charlie visits Ann-Marie's house, he discovers her true identity: She is a secret agent in hiding and is currently being hunted by her former employer, a powerful criminal organization. Their leader, Viktor, is on a personal vendetta to capture and eliminate her. However, Charlie is captivated by her courage and intrigued by her perilous plight. As they spend more time together, they begin to trust each other, and Charlie learns that Ann-Marie was falsely implicated in a major crime, which led to her being targeted. To win back her freedom and clear her name, Ann-Marie is on a mission to expose undisclosed information about Viktor's organization. They slowly develop feelings for each other, which drives Charlie to help Ann-Marie in any way he can. Still, as he becomes increasingly involved in Ann-Marie's life, their safety is continually jeopardized, and they find themselves constantly on the edge. Act III: Using Charlie's skills as a locksmith and Ann-Marie's connections, they manage to uncover and decrypt sensitive information about Viktor's illicit operations. They are hesitant, but they decide to leak this information to the authorities in hopes of neutralizing the organization and absolving Ann-Marie of any alleged wrongdoings. However, this move only infuriates Viktor further, leading him to intensify his efforts to capture Ann-Marie. In the climactic showdown, Viktor and his henchmen corner Ann-Marie and Charlie in the abandoned house. Armed and dangerous, they are set to eliminate both Ann-Marie and anyone who has assisted her. The house is rigged with explosives, and a fiery countdown is initiated. However, Charlie and Ann-Marie quickly devise an escape plan using a secret tunnel underneath the house. At the most crucial moment, with no time to spare, Ann-Marie gets trapped under debris from the collapsing house. Charlie, determined to save her, manages to push her into the hidden tunnel to safety. The explosion occurs, and Viktor and his henchmen are eliminated. However, Charlie's fate is unclear. Epilogue: With the criminal organization dismantled and Ann-Marie's name cleared, the aftermath of their adventure leaves Ann-Marie questioning Charlie's survival. As the weeks go by, the town slowly returns to normal life, and Ann-Marie finds herself wondering if she will ever see Charlie again. The film concludes with a heartwarming reunion between the two, sharing their undeniable connection and proving that despite the darkness of their pasts, they managed to find the light within each other. Together, Charlie and Ann-Marie rediscover happiness and love, as they start afresh in the quaint coastal town that brought them together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What areas of the brain communicate to the primary motor cortex?\\"  Context: \\"The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The areas of the brain that communicate to the primary motor cortex include the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.

Context: In 1939, Nazi Germany's largest and most powerful battleship, Bismarck, is launched in a ceremony at Hamburg with Adolf Hitler attending. The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness.

Here is a question about this article: Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. The Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands. What is the answer to this question: Where do the Lenape reside today?","output":"Today, the majority of the Lenape people reside in the U.S. state of Oklahoma due to the United States government's Indian removal policy in the 1860s. This policy led to their relocation from their traditional lands in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory, which is now present-day Oklahoma and its surrounding areas. However, there are also Lenape communities living in other regions, including Wisconsin in the United States, Ontario in Canada, and a few still residing in their traditional homelands along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. The relocation of the Lenape people and their settlement in these various locations are attributable to factors like conflicts with Europeans, intertribal warfare, diseases introduced by settlers, and historical events like the American Revolutionary War and United States' independence that forced them to move further west."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any. SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10 Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer is disappointed with the movie and feels that it fails to create a meaningful connection with the audience.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.  After reading the above, is \\"It used to be the best in the world, and his plan will help restore that accolade\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What assertion did President Obama make about the country's infrastructure?\\"? Pick from: [I] no [II] yes","output":"The correct answer is [II] yes. The reasoning behind this answer is based on the statements made by President Obama as mentioned in the text. He stated, \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" indicating that in the past, he believes the United States held the best infrastructure globally, but it has since fallen from that standing. His proposed plan for infrastructure improvement is aimed at restoring this status. Thus, the assertion President Obama makes about the country's infrastructure, as stated in the question, is accurately represented in the provided answer choice, \\"It used to be the best in the world, and his plan will help restore that accolade\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The children live with their parents, Woody (Delroy Lindo), a struggling musician, and Carolyn (Alfre Woodard), a schoolteacher. The neighborhood is filled with colorful characters. The Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, Tony Eyes (David Patrick Kelly) continuously sings. Snuffy (Spike Lee) and Right Hand Man (N. Jeremi Duru) are glue sniffers. Vic Powell (Isaiah Washington) is a war vet who lives upstairs from the Carmichaels. One day, the Carmichael children get into a dispute with Tony who alleges that they are always throwing trash into his area. The argument escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved. Tony is still yelling when Vic comes downstairs. Vic then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store. One night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody because he isn't earning money as a musician and because he has bounced checks. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television. Carolyn later turns off the TV. Clinton turns it back on. Carolyn grabs him for disobeying her and Woody grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody drags Carolyn down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle. Carolyn kicks Woody out of the house. Woody brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip. As they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill. The trip is postponed and the family has to use candles for light. A few days later, Nate and Troy travel to the South to stay with relatives. Troy stays with her cousin, Viola (Patriece Nelson), who was adopted by Uncle...

The passage is: \\"The ghanaian boy was starving.\\" To complete the task, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the four types of stereotype or anti-stereotype you need to classify the passage into: gender, profession, race, and religion. A stereotype is a generalized belief about a particular group, while an anti-stereotype is an idea that contradicts general assumptions about that group. 2. Read the passage carefully and identify if any stereotype or anti-stereotype is present. In our case, the passage talks about a Ghanaian boy who is starving. 3. Examine the passage for any clues related to gender: There is no mention of any generalized belief or idea related to the boy's gender, so it is not a gender stereotype or anti-stereotype. 4. Check if there are any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes related to the profession. In the passage, there is no mention of a profession, so this category does not apply. 5. Evaluate the passage for any racial stereotypes or anti-stereotypes. The mention of a Ghanaian boy being starving might be considered as a racial stereotype, as it suggests that children from Ghana, or potentially Africa, struggle with hunger and poverty. 6. Finally, look for any stereotypes or anti-stereotypes related to religion. The passage does not convey any information about the boy's religion, so this category does not apply.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to get scratches out of a stainless steel sink  Use a scratch remover for deeper scratches.  Fine scratches can usually be rubbed out with a cleaning product or an abrasive pad. However, very deep scratches that are obvious to see require scratch removes.","output":"One of the most effective scratch removers available on the market is Bar Keepers Friend, which is a non-abrasive powder cleanser that can effectively eliminate deep scratches without causing additional damage to the surface of your stainless steel sink. The first step in using a scratch remover is to thoroughly clean the sink, ensuring there is no debris, dirt, or grease that may interfere with the scratch removal process. After cleaning, dampen a soft cloth or sponge with warm water and apply a small amount of Bar Keepers Friend to the cloth or sponge. Next, gently rub the scratch remover over the affected area, following the natural grain of the stainless steel, which is typically a straight or slightly curved line pattern. Avoid using circular or back-and-forth motions, as this may cause further scratching or create an inconsistent appearance on the surface. Apply moderate pressure as you rub the scratch remover to ensure that it penetrates the surface and effectively removes the scratch. Once you have covered the entire scratched area, carefully rinse the sink with warm water to remove any residual scratch remover. It is important not to let the scratch remover sit for too long on the surface, as it may cause discoloration or staining if not promptly rinsed away. After rinsing, thoroughly dry the sink with a clean, soft cloth to prevent water spots or streaks. Finally, examine the sink closely to ensure that the scratches have been removed or significantly diminished in appearance. If scratches remain, you may need to repeat the process, but be sure to exercise caution and avoid overdoing it, as excessive rubbing can cause damage to stainless steel. It is also worth investing in a quality sink protector to prevent future scratches on the sink. This protective layer can not only save you from the hassle of having to remove scratches frequently but also keep your stainless steel sink looking polished and new for a longer time. In conclusion, removing scratches from a stainless steel sink can be accomplished by using a scratch remover like Bar Keepers Friend and following the proper procedure for cleaning, rubbing, rinsing, and drying the sink. By showing patience and dedication during the process, your stainless steel sink can be restored to its original shine and remain free from unsightly scratches, allowing it to maintain a sophisticated and clean appearance in your kitchen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference , and the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress rings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray.

Unbeknownst to the assembled people, however, something is lurking in the woods, not quite human and not quite animal. Two friends skiing on the North slope, Heidi (Annie McEnroe) and Jennifer (Kathy Christopher), find mysterious tracks and hear some disturbing noises coming from the woods. Heidi takes off, but Jennifer lags behind and is set upon by a monstrous beast.Tony Rill (Robert Logan), manager of the resort, is summoned and told that a female skier was found, babbling incoherently about some sort of monster and her missing friend. Rill, doubtful at first, listens to Heidi's story and, despite being unsettled by what he hears, surmises that it was probably a grizzly bear. He and a search party set out and split up to find Jennifer. Rill comes upon a remote stretch where he finds Jennifer's jacket, bloody and torn to shreds. He also hears a monstrous roar come from the woods and turns just in time to glimpse something white, hairy and massive at the edge of the treeline.Meanwhile, back at the resort, Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) and his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) arrive. Seberg, a former Olympic Ski champion, has fallen on hard times and has come to Colorado to see if his old friend Rill can give him a job.

Rill, meanwhile, informs his grandmother, and owner of the resort, Carrie Rill (Sylvia Sidney) about what he saw and heard, and tells her that they should put up signs restricting access to the area and inform the sheriff.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Mexica (Nahuatl: \\"Mxihcah\\", ; the singular is \\"Mxihcatl\\" ) or Mexicas were an indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico, known today as the rulers of the Aztec Empire.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - \`\` Freakshow '' is a single by the British band The Cure which was released on 13 June 2008 on Geffen Records in the United Kingdom .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? What she did was know this theory. Pick your answer from: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","output":"1). Unacceptable Understanding the phrase \\"What she did was know this theory\\" requires a dissection of its grammatical components and an analysis of how these parts function together within standard English usage. To start, let's look at the verb 'know'. The verb 'know' is not an action verb; instead, it falls into a category labeled as stative verbs. These verbs represent a state or condition, such as to be, to seem, to understand, and in this case, to know. Stative verbs fundamentally describe situations that are steady and don't involve discernible movement; therefore, they do not typically function well in the past tense when describing a singular, specific event. Still, the main issue with the sentence in question is the phrase \\"What she did was.\\" This is a common euphemistic phrase used in English to emphasize the unexpectedness or impact of an action. It is typically followed by an action verb in the base form to provide a linguistic 'punch'. For instance, \\"What she did was break the window.\\" Here, 'break' is an action verb that denotes a specific, singular action in the past. The action is completed and, importantly, palpable/observable. However, in your sentence, that isn't the case. Using \\"know\\" doesn't fit because knowing is not a one-time perceptible action. It is a continuous state, a possession of knowledge ongoing over time that isn't bound to a specific moment. Thus, even if 'know' can be used in past tense, as in \\"She knew the theory,\\" in the specific context of \\"What she did was ...\\" it is not applicable. So, from a strictly linguistic perspective, even though informal or conversational English might render the original sentence understandable, it is not correct. Specifically, traditional grammarians and linguists would likely judge it as 'unacceptable' due to the misuse of a stative verb as an action verb and its awkward application after the phrase \\"What she did was...\\"  More suitable suggestions for the sentence could be: \\"What she did was master this theory.\\" \\"What she did was apply this theory.\\" \\"What she did was learn this theory.\\" Each of these alternatives conveys a specific and observable action, thus aligning more accurately with traditional rules and expectations concerning English grammar structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. When more wax is softened, this will result in a larger hive, as the softened wax allows for an increased rate of construction and expansion. As more chewed up wax is available, worker bees can continue chewing and softening wax from within at a faster pace, which contributes to the growth of the hive.  The second effect mentioned pertains to the honeycomb cells being used to house nectar, honey, and pollen. With a larger hive and an increased amount of softened wax, there will be more honeycomb cells available. Consequently, this will lead to a greater storage capacity for the bees to store nectar, honey, and pollen. The increased storage space will, in turn, benefit the overall functioning and sustenance of the bee colony, as they will have more resources to use for food, growth, and reproduction. So, the supposed perturbation of having more softened wax will have a more significant effect on both the hive size and the storage capacity for nectar, honey, and pollen within the honeycomb's cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The Swedish fleet was given new orders to recapture Gotland. Step 1: Identify the question - \\"Which fleet was given new orders to recapture Gotland?\\" Step 2: Find relevant information from the given article.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed...

On the other hand, the Thompson-Lundmark Mine project, located in the Northwest Territories of Canada, is a gold deposit that was discovered in the 1950s. However, its development into a functional mine took longer, and it remained just a deposit for many years. As a result, the mine does not have as long a history as the Lupin Mine. Although both mines are located in Canada and have contributed to the country's gold reserves, Lupin Mine's earlier operational start and longer production period make it the mine with the longer history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: In Life Sciences it is important to note that whenever a structure has an increased surface area, there is an increase in the functioning of that structure.  When someone gets bigger what happens to their body functions increases or decreases? Answer:","output":"In life sciences, an increase in surface area generally leads to an increase in the functioning of a structure. However, when an organism or a person gets bigger, the relationship between their surface area and volume plays a significant role in determining how their body functions may change. As an organism grows, its volume increases at a faster rate than its surface area. This is due to the fact that volume increases by the cube of the growth factor, while surface area increases by the square of the growth factor. As a result, the surface area to volume ratio decreases as the organism gets bigger. This ratio has implications for several body functions including heat exchange, nutrient absorption, and waste removal, among others. When someone gets bigger, certain body functions may experience the following changes: 1. Heat exchange: A smaller surface area relative to volume makes it harder for organisms to dissipate heat through their surface, leading to a potential overheating risk. For larger organisms, specialized cooling mechanisms (such as sweating in humans) are needed to maintain adequate temperature regulation. 2. Nutrient absorption and waste removal: As organisms grow and the surface area to volume ratio decreases, the efficiency of nutrient absorption and waste removal may be compromised due to a larger volume of cells and slower exchange of materials through the surface. However, larger organisms usually develop specialized circulatory systems to compensate for this decrease in efficiency. 3. Metabolic rate: A smaller surface area to volume ratio in larger organisms often results in a lower metabolic rate per unit of body mass. This is because metabolic processes generate heat, and a smaller surface area relative to volume makes it more challenging to dissipate that heat, leading to the need for a reduced metabolic rate to prevent overheating. 4. Load-bearing structures: As organisms become bigger, their load-bearing structures, such as bones and muscles, must increase in size and strength to support the increased body mass. This can lead to adaptations in their locomotion and posture. In summary, when someone gets bigger, the relationship between surface area and volume becomes more disproportionate, which can lead to changes in body functions. Some body functions may decrease in efficiency, while others may require adaptations or specialized mechanisms to accommodate the increased size. The overall impact on their body functions depends on the degree of growth and the organism's ability to adapt to these changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hallucinating one, for example, looks like it combines epistemology and cognitive psychology. More of that and we might have a better informed electorate. And courses that convey the message that history, ancient or modern, was real and where we came from are a good thing.

They take only the most superficial look at the classes being taught, without understanding the content at all. You are skating dangerously close to doing the same thing here. For example, James Mattingly's \\"hallucination\\" course is simply a straightforward course in epistemology, a core area of philosophy, and an area of thought that's extremely important to understanding sources of knowledge, including science and logic. Mattingly is a top philosopher of physics and chemistry, and I have no doubt this is a high quality class (we tried to hire him in my philosophy dept. a few years ago, but lost him to Georgetown). Clearly, the title of his class and the class description are just meant to entice students into what can sound like a very dry and technical subject.

Conservative musicologists used to deride the study of popular music, feeling that the music was not worthy of attention compared to the classics. An early rejoinder from one of the first to examine popular music from a scholarly perspective was that people spend up to three quarters of their lives surrounded by popular music, so it makes sense to understand what the stuff is and what effect it has on people. I'm not saying that everything that comes out of the academy is worthy -- no doubt, there's a lot of junk. But, how can you tell if a line of research is stupid without becoming familiar with it?

He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915-1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922-1923), University of Wyoming (1924-1926), Haskell Institute--now Haskell Indian Nations University (1929-1932), and Albright College (1937-1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz was the head coach of the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11-11-2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Historian Linda M. Waggoner has traced Dietz' heritage in several articles in Indian Country Today Media Network and at a 2013 symposium at the National Museum of the American Indian. According to census records and to his birth certificate, he was born William Henry Dietz, or \\"Willie,\\" on August 17, 1884, in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, at 16 West Humbird Street. His father William Wallace Dietz, settled in the area in 1871 and was elected county sheriff in 1877. He married Leanna Ginder in November 1879. \\"Willie\\" attended Oklahoma's Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, where it is likely he feigned some kind of Indian identity for the first time. As Waggoner wrote, \\"Naturally, visitors to the St. Louis World's Fair exhibit, including Dietz's future wife, Winnebago artist Angel De Cora (1871-1919), thought Dietz was a Chilocco student.\\"  In 1921, Dietz took a coaching position with Purdue University in Indiana. After Angel De Cora died in 1919, he married Doris O. Pottlitzer, a middle-aged local journalist, on January 29, 1922. The week previous to their marriage, Purdue officials fired him for illegal recruiting. In spring 1933, George Preston Marshall, owner of the Boston Braves, hired Dietz to replace Coach Lud Wray. In 1937, the team moved to Washington, D.C.  For the rest of his life, Dietz continued to promote himself as Lone Star Dietz, the son of W.W. and Julia One Star of Pine Ridge. He took on his last coaching job in 1937 for Albright College in Pennsylvania; in 1964, still married to Doris, Dietz died in Reading, Pennsylvania. He and Doris were so poor that former teammates purchased his headstone.

Sentence 2: Of the twelve stories included, six were previously published in the author's first collection, \\"The Evening News\\". Step 2: The differences between the sentences are as follows: - Sentence 1 includes \\"that are\\" between \\"twelve stories\\" and \\"included,\\" whereas sentence 2 omits it. - Sentence 1 uses \\"evening news\\" as the title of the author's first collection, whereas sentence 2 uses \\"The Evening News.\\" Step 3: The overall meaning of both sentences is largely the same - they both state that out of twelve stories, six have been published in the author's first collection, and the respective titles of the collections mentioned are similar. However, there are some differences: - The grammatical structure of sentence 2 is more concise, as it omits \\"that are,\\" but this does not change the intended meaning. - The capitalization and addition of \\"The\\" in the title of sentence 2 could slightly change the interpretation of the titles, as \\"evening news\\" and \\"The Evening News\\" may refer to different works if the author had multiple works with similar titles. In conclusion, the sentences essentially convey the same information, but there is a slight difference in the specific title of the author's first collection and sentence structure. They can be considered to convey the same meaning, but with subtle variations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Title: junk, from the word \\"go'' ......

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who sells her ticket to a fellow passenger?  Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

Queens Park Rangers (QPR) have endured yet another difficult time on the road, succumbing to their ninth consecutive Premier League away defeat at the hands of Arsenal. Despite their efforts and brief moments of hope, the R's could not turn the tide in their favor, highlighting the necessity for some urgent changes. Step 2: Discuss Charlie Austin's role in the match and how his performance positively contributed. Amongst the setbacks, one ray of hope for QPR fans came in the form of striker Charlie Austin, who managed to get on the scoresheet with a well-converted penalty in the latter stages of the game. Austin has been undeniably crucial to the team's attack, often shouldering responsibilities and delivering goals that have boosted QPR's chances in various fixtures throughout the season. Step 3: Present Bobby Zamora's opinion that Charlie Austin should be given a new contract with the club. Veteran striker Bobby Zamora has voiced his support for Austin, urging QPR to provide the goal-machine with a new contract in order to secure his services for the foreseeable future. The 33-year-old Zamora believes that Austin's prowess on the field has not gone unnoticed and warns that big clubs will likely be keeping a close eye on the star forward as the January transfer window approaches. Step 4: Conclude the article by reiterating the importance of Charlie Austin in QPR and the club's need for improvement. The fight for Premier League survival continues, and with Charlie Austin proving to be a crucial player, it's imperative for QPR to ensure they keep their key striker intact.

Options are: [i] not enough information; [ii] he had a jogging track suits; [iii] sweat pants; [iv] a suit; Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \\"flashing\\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \\"graphitized\\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was not a problem for early carbon filaments?","output":"One issue that was not a problem for early carbon filaments in light bulbs was the scarcity or high cost of the materials used. Carbon, which was derived from carbonized paper or bamboo, was abundant and relatively inexpensive compared to later materials like tungsten. This allowed inventors and manufacturers to experiment with and produce carbon filament light bulbs with less concern about the overall cost of the materials involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire.  - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (; 27 October 1919  27 July 1980), known as Mohammad Reza Shah, was the Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. He took the title Shhanshh (\\"Emperor\\" or \\"King of Kings\\") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi of the Iranian monarchy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Allen was born in Hammersmith, west London, daughter of Keith Allen, a Welsh-born comedian, and film producer Alison Owen. She has an older sister, Sarah; a younger brother, actor Alfie (who was the subject of her song \\"Alfie\\"); and a younger sister, Rebecca. She is the goddaughter of Wild Colonials vocalist Angela McCluskey. She is the third-cousin of singer Sam Smith. Context: The success convinced her label to allow her more creative control over the album and to use some of the songs that she had written instead of forcing her to work with mainstream producers. Allen decided to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, finishing the rest of the album in two weeks. Allen's debut album, Alright, Still, was released in July 2006. Most of the tracks had been previewed on her MySpace page, including the singles \\"Smile\\", \\"LDN\\", \\"Knock 'Em Out\\", and \\"Alfie\\". In September 2006, \\"Smile\\" was made available on the US version of iTunes Store. By December 2006, her music video for Smile had been played on various music channels as well as the song getting a little airplay. Entertainment Weekly named Alright, Still as one of the top 10 albums of 2006 despite the fact that it had not yet been released in the US. Allen also did several promotional ads for MTV as their Discover and Download artist of the month for January 2007. The album was released in the US on 30 January 2007, landing at 20 on the Billboard 200. By January 2009, the album had sold 960,000 copies in the UK and 520,000 copies in the US.  In 2007, she played the newly launched Park Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, replacing MIA who had cancelled. During the festival she reunited two members of The Specials, an act that guitarist Lynval Golding claimed played a \\"massive part\\" in the group's 2009 reunion. She also sang the vocals on the top ten single, \\"Oh My God\\", a cover of the Kaiser Chiefs song by Mark Ronson. On 1 July 2007, Allen appeared at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana. She sang \\"LDN\\" and \\"Smile\\". Allen's single \\"Littlest Things\\" from her album produced by Ronson, helped earn him a \\"Producer of the Year - Non Classical\\" 2008 Grammy Award. She also provided background vocals to a couple of songs on the Kaiser Chiefs' third album in 2008. Allen won a 2008 BMI songwriting award for \\"Smile\\".  Allen signed a one series contract to present her own BBC Three TV show titled Lily Allen and Friends based on the social networking phenomenon that helped to launch her music career. Guests included Mark Ronson, Joanna Page, James Corden, Lauren Laverne, Roisin Murphy, Louis Walsh, and Danny Dyer. The show attracted only 2 per cent of the total multi-channel audience despite a high-profile nationwide marketing campaign. Citing Allen's rapid development as a TV host and her popularity among its target audience BBC Three announced it was renewing Lily Allen and Friends for a second season. BBC Three controller Danny Cohen later said that the show would not air in the Spring of 2009 as originally scheduled because of music commitments.

A forward, he played for several clubs including Liverpool and Hamburger SV. He went on to manage Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City, winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs. He also managed the England national team. After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. He led the team to a winning start with 3-1 victory over Poland to reignite England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, and they entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2-0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts).  After an initial popular period as manager, he began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3-2 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2-0 lead after 17 minutes. A 1-0 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, cost their opposition (the defending champions) progression to the quarter-finals, but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3-2, this time after taking a 2-1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over.  Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000, after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium, before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager - although unlike Don Revie (1974-1977) or Steve McClaren (2006-2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England.  When Sven-Goran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old. Keegan went on, \\"I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr Eriksson was and I'm delighted for him because that's the way it should be.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did he get the position with England?","output":"As mentioned earlier, Kevin Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999.

Article: Scientist Marcus Eriksen stood ankle deep in the murky Los Angeles River on Friday and dipped a net into the water, looking for a problem.      Eriksen was searching for \\"microbeads,\\" bits of plastic no bigger than salt grains that absorb toxins such as motor oil and insecticides as they tumble downstream and into the Pacific Ocean.      The tiny polyethylene and polypropylene beads are an emerging concern among scientists and environmentalists. The beads come mostly from personal care products such as facial exfoliants and body washes. They are not biodegradable, however, and because they are not removed easily by wastewater treatment plants, they flow out to sea and enter the food chain.      \\"Microplastic is now a ubiquitous contaminant in the Pacific Ocean — and seas around the world,\\" said Eriksen, a scientist with the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to researching plastics in the world's waterways. \\"We believe that 80% of it comes from coastal watersheds like Los Angeles.\\"      Eriksen is just starting to test the Los Angeles River to determine if it holds microbeads, and if so, their source. On Friday, he found what he was looking for in about 10 minutes.      Near the confluence of the river and Arroyo Seco, about three miles north of downtown, Eriksen found a handful of algae and wriggling leeches speckled with tiny filaments, shards and beads that could have come from myriad sources: laundry wastewater, degraded plastic bags, stir sticks, personal care products.      \\"The scary thing is that the beads sponge up toxins, then get consumed by organisms from shellfish to crabs to fish\\" later eaten by humans, he said.      Scientists are only beginning to understand the hazards posed by microplastic pollution in the world's oceans and inland waterways. In 2012, Eriksen and a team of researchers discovered large amounts of microbeads and other microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes. Those findings prompted a coalition of mayors of Great Lakes cities to ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to determine the possible health risks to lake ecosystems and humans.      A year later, 5 Gyres launched a campaign asking the manufacturers of personal care products to remove plastic microbeads and replace them with nonplastic alternatives such as crushed walnut husks and apricot kernels that will degrade naturally. Several companies have agreed to phase microbeads out of their product lines.      In a statement, the Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, for example, said it has \\"stopped developing new products containing polyethylene microbeads.\\" The company expects by 2015 to have replaced microbeads with alternatives in half the products that currently use them.      That's not soon enough for 5 Gyres, which is circulating a petition titled, \\"Get plastic off my face and out of my water now!\\"      Standing in the river, Eriksen demonstrated the problem. He squeezed several drops of Johnson & Johnson's Clean and Clear facial scrub into a small jar full of water, then shook it up and filtered the foamy mixture through a black T-shirt.      Left behind on the fabric were hundreds of tiny white, pink and blue plastic beads. \\"We estimate there are about 330,000 microbeads per tube,\\" he said.      The source of beads washing down the L.A. River isn't known yet. In rainy weather, the river holds vast amounts of runoff from across the region. But in the current drought, 80% of the flow comes from the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, which sits 12 miles upstream from Eriksen's survey site and treats sewage from the homes of 800,000 San Fernando Valley residents. The other 20% is from myriad sources in the area.      Jimmy Tokeshi, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, suggested it's not coming from the plant, which sends sewage through a series of holding tanks, digesters, filters and sanitizers before discharging the treated water into the river at a rate up to 27 million gallons a day.      \\"The city of L.A. meets and/or exceeds all Clean Water Act requirements as well as all local, county and state water regulations,\\" Tokeshi said. Using cloth filters, \\"We capture microplastics that are larger in size than 10 microns, or 0.01 millimeters, in the water reclamation plant,\\" he said.      Most of the visible plastic debris Eriksen found was much larger than 10 microns in size.      Eriksen said he doesn't yet know the origin of the beads. But he said his nets don't lie.      \\"Using a net only 2 feet wide for 10 minutes in a stream a few hundred feet across, I caught dozens of bits of plastic,\\" he said. \\"So, it's easy to extrapolate that millions of plastic particles flow through this channel every day.\\"      He pivoted to face downstream, and with a wave of his muddy hands, he declared: \\"That's a problem.\\"      louis.sahagun@latimes.com ||||| ALBANY – Tiny microbeads used as abrasives in everything from skin care products to toothpaste, which scientists say are polluting Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes, would be banned under legislation being proposed by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.      Scientists have warned that the plastic pollutants, which has shown up in studies of Lake Erie, can last for centuries.      Schneiderman called his plan “common-sense legislation” that will reduce the flow of the tiny plastic particles into key waterways of New York.      It would be the nation’s first such legislation calling for a ban of the particles now used in more than 100 consumer products.      The Microbead-Free Waters Act would ban the distribution, sale or manufacture in New York of beauty and other personal care products that contain plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size.      The legislation comes after a group that represents the interests of more than 100 cities in the United States and Canada along the Great Lakes urged federal officials in the two nations to crack down on the use of the tiny plastic particles in consumer products.      They cited a State University of New York at Fredonia study that found the plastic particles in three Great Lakes, with the highest concentration in Lake Erie. Scientists say there are other non-toxic particles companies can use in their products besides the plastic microbeads, some of which are so small they can only been seen under a microscope.      Environmental groups say the products get into waterways from the pipes in consumers’ homes are often not caught by public sewage plants and are a threat to drinking water and fish stocks.      Dave Ullrich, executive director of the Chicago-based Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which represents 111 Great Lakes cities, including Niagara Falls, said the water in the lakes turns over relatively slowly.      The water now in Lake Erie takes about five years to totally replace itself with new water, while Lake Superior can take 200 years. As a result, the microbeads his group is trying to get banned tend to accumulate in the Great Lakes more than other waterways.      “Any action of this nature that can make the right thing happen, namely to prevent new products and getting them out of the system as quickly as possible, is a good thing,’’ Ullrich said in an interview.      He noted his group has written to the 11 companies that use microbeads and have gotten responses from six of them with varying levels of commitments. Ullrich said other states are considering bans, though he believes New York is the first with actual proposed legislation.      Schneiderman’s office said three manufacturers – Proctor and Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive – have recently agreed to phase out using microbeads in their consumer products.      They said products containing the terms “polyethylene’’ or “polypropylene” on their ingredient list are those with microbeads.      email: tprecious@buffnews.com ||||| Right now 86 NGOs from 37 countries are supporting the campaign! Already 446 brands from 117 different manufacturers promised to remove plastic microbeads from their products. To achieve a microbead free environment, we need your support. Any gift will help! ||||| Lawmakers in Albany could make New York the first state to outlaw the tiny plastic beads used in personal care products like facial scrubs and toothpastes.      Legislation that is scheduled to be introduced on Tuesday by Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney of Suffolk County on behalf of Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman would prohibit the sale of cosmetic and beauty products that contain the beads, which are added to aid exfoliation and abrasion.      The beads appear in the tens of millions in the Great Lakes, according to scientists’ estimates, with high concentrations along the New York shores of Lake Erie. They become coated with toxins like PCBs and can be eaten by fish and other marine life. Scientists suggest that those toxins could be working their way back up the food chain to humans.      The beads and other bits of tiny “microplastic” debris slip through wastewater treatment plants and have also been found in the Los Angeles River and in the Pacific Ocean. Antipollution activists argue that limiting the use of cosmetics, which can have hundreds of thousands of beads in a bottle, can help limit the environmental risk. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Scientist Marcus Eriksen has expressed his concerns over the presence of microbeads in water systems, especially in coastal watersheds like Los Angeles. Microbeads are tiny bits of plastic no bigger than salt grains that come mainly from personal care products such as facial exfoliants and body washes. These beads have the capacity to absorb toxins and find their way into the food chain, posing a significant risk to human health. As they are not biodegradable and cannot be easily removed by wastewater treatment plants, they flow out into the ocean, contaminating waterways around the world. Eriksen, a scientist with the 5 Gyres Institute—a nonprofit dedicated to researching plastics in the world's waterways—is conducting tests to determine the presence and source of microbeads in the Los Angeles River. Several companies have already agreed to phase out the use of microbeads in their product lines, but the 5 Gyres Institute believes that more needs to be done. They are currently circulating a petition titled \\"Get plastic off my face and out of my water now!\\" to promote awareness of the issue. The exact source of microbeads washing down the L.A. River is still unknown, but Eriksen's research indicates that millions of plastic particles flow through the river channel each day. Efforts to tackle the problem of microplastic pollution in oceans and waterways are still in their early stages, with the potential hazards to ecosystems and human health not yet fully understood. However, campaigns such as those initiated by the 5 Gyres Institute seek to address the problem and encourage the adoption of non-plastic alternatives that can degrade naturally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person that is a little neurotic?, using the article: In 1987, Doris Duke, considered the wealthiest woman in the world, hires Bernard Lafferty, who lists Elizabeth Taylor and Peggy Lee as former employers on his résumé, as her majordomo. He explains a six-month gap in his employment history was due to \\"health issues,\\" a euphemism for time spent in rehab to deal with his addiction to alcohol. He assures Doris, who immediately suspects the truth, he is capable of performing his duties without any problems. As Bernard moves in, the viewer can quickly tell he is a little neurotic, first putting portraits of his former employers, Taylor and Lee, in his bedroom, then informing the rest of the staff he is now \\"Miss Duke's eyes and ears\\" and demanding they listen to him. Despite Bernard's growing affection for Doris, the brash and often crude Doris thinks little of him, not even remembering how to correctly pronounce his name. However, their situation slowly evolves into a more emotionally intimate but non-physical relationship as Doris returns from a plastic surgery center one evening, drunk and on painkillers, and is aided by Bernard who stays with her through the night., what would be the answer ?

Imagine you have a magical number represented by the letter 'k'. We want to find what this magical number is.  Here is what we have: 1347 * k + 83308 - 22964 = -241 * k Let's break this down a little: 1. We have some blocks, and we have 1347 groups of 'k' blocks.  2. We also have 83308 more individual blocks, but mommy took away 22964 blocks from us. 3. In the end, we have another -241 groups of 'k' blocks (it means someone wants to take these groups back) Now we're going to solve it step by step: Step 1: Combine the number of blocks that mommy took away: 83308 - 22964 = 60344 So now we have: 1347 * k + 60344 = -241 * k Step 2: Bring the -241 * k blocks from the right side to the left side by adding 241 * k to both sides: 1347 * k + 241 * k + 60344 = 0 Step 3: Now let's combine the groups of k blocks: (1347 + 241) * k + 60344 = 0 1588 * k + 60344 = 0 Step 4: We have to get 'k' alone or by itself, so let's take 60344 blocks away from the left side: 1588 * k = -60344 Step 5: Finally, divide the -60344 blocks by the 1588 groups to find out how many blocks are in each group (which is 'k'): k = -60344 / 1588 k = -38 The magical number 'k' we were looking for is -38!

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company.

Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk.

This plate broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era, leading to the development of the Tethys Sea between Laurasia and Gondwana in the Jurassic Period. The Tethys Sea was eventually squeezed between colliding tectonic plates, resulting in the formation of the Alpide belt – a mountain range extending from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia.

The Duma, which is Russia's lower house of parliament, is advocating that it is high time for Russia to assist Serbia in tackling the economic and political challenges caused by these sanctions. In response to the Duma's call for action, various political and economic experts have voiced their opinions and highlighted the potential implications of Russia's intervention. Background of Belgrade Sanctions: The sanctions against Belgrade date back to the 1990s when the United Nations Security Council introduced measures to curtail the ongoing conflicts caused by the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Although there have been amendments in recent years, the lingering effects of these sanctions continue to hinder Serbia's growth and development. The UN sanctions primarily focused on imposing restrictions on weapons supplies, travel, and finances. Consequently, Belgrade has been grappling with economic setbacks and mounting political pressures while trying to foster diplomacy with the international community. Russia's Role in Supporting Belgrade: Russia and Serbia have shared a historical bond, marked by strong political, cultural, and economic ties. Over the years, Moscow has been a prominent ally of Belgrade and has stepped in on numerous occasions to veto UN resolutions that might further harm Serbia's interests. Russia's support for Serbia has primarily stemmed from their shared Slavic and Orthodox Christian heritage, which has been a driving force in fostering closer relations between the two nations. Benefits of Lifting Sanctions: Lifting the sanctions against Belgrade will undoubtedly pave the way for tremendous growth opportunities for Serbia. With the imposition of these measures gone, Serbia will be able to regain its financial footing and elevate its living standards. The nation's infrastructure will have the chance to prosper, and Serbia will ultimately gain the ability to establish stronger global ties. Moreover, the lifting of sanctions will enable Serbia to reintegrate into the international community and be seen as an active player in fostering global peace and stability. This will lead to increased foreign investments and robust economic growth, gradually transforming the country's development landscape. Potential Implications of Russia's Intervention: While the Russian Duma's call for intervention is viewed positively by many in Serbia, critics argue that Russia's active role may spark concerns amongst Serbia's western neighbors. Moscow's interference can be interpreted as a strategic move to expand its influence in the Balkan region. Additionally, Russia's support for Serbia might exacerbate tensions with countries that are part of the EU or those that have expressed their desire to join the bloc. The situation could lead to a more significant rift in an already fragile region, causing obstacles for future political and economic collaborations. Conclusion: The appeal by the Russian Duma to help Belgrade lift the sanctions represents an opportunity for Serbia to reclaim its standing in the international community. However, it is imperative to weigh the potential consequences of Russia's intervention on regional stability. An effective and diplomatic approach that takes into account the interests of all parties involved would be the most beneficial path to forge better relationships and improve Serbia's political and economic prospects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, let me provide a detailed explanation of the events that led to this point. The narrator and Asher were watching a series together, but Asher appeared to be puzzled by its complex timeline. In an effort to help Asher understand the storyline and its intricacies, the narrator had to draw pictures to provide better clarity. This activity could have taken a considerable amount of time and effort, as the narrator found it necessary to visually represent the series' plot structure to enhance Asher's comprehension. Throughout the process, the narrator and Asher must have been engaged in discussion about what was happening, or perhaps about the meaning behind certain events and characters in the series. Their conversations might have consisted of analyzing character motives, discussing potential resolutions of plotlines, or speculating about upcoming twists in the story. Amid this engrossing process of watching the series, discussing it, and drawing pictures to demystify the timeline, time passed, and the clock reached 6:43 pm. The narrator realized that it was evening and time to feed the kids, which was an essential responsibility that requires attention. At this moment, when the narrator acknowledges the time, the primary focus shifts from the shared activity with Asher to taking care of the children. This underscores the importance of balancing leisure time and obligations, such as ensuring the kids are fed on time. In summary, the narrator is immersed in an educational and insightful experience with Asher as they try to decipher the intricate timeline of the series they are watching.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Snout-nosed crocodiles with jaws strong enough to crush clam shells ruled the swampy wetlands that covered Peru 13 million years ago. Palaeontologists have discovered the remains of seven different species of crocodile and cayman, including three new species, in the area around the modern Amazon river. The fossils were found in the Pebas district of northern Peru. The new species of caymen Gnatusuchus pebasensis (shown in the reconstruction above) had a short but wide jaw that was powerful enough to crush clams and other shell fish. It used its snout to dig in the mud. One of the new species, named Gnatusuchus pebasensis, had blunt, peg-like teeth and used its broad snout to dig shellfish from the muddy swamp floor. It grew up to 5.2ft (1.6 metres) in length and had just 11 teeth. Most cayman, which are related to alligators, tend to have around 20 teeth. Prehistoric crocodiles escaped the jaws of predatory dinosaurs by running like dogs, according to a study published last year. The findings explain  how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. While  most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. After the devastating extinction that ended the Triassic period, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour. Another blunt nosed crocodile was named Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis, which means 'grinding or crushing machine'. The scientists estimate it grew up to 6.2ft (1.9 metres) in length. However, these new species were dwarved by two other previously known species of giant cayman whose fossils were also found nearby. Purussaurus neivensis and Mourasuchus atopus are thought to have grown up to 39ft (12 metres) in length and were more generalised predators. The researchers say that it is highly unusual to have found a habitat that had so many species of cayman living alongside each other. There are six cayman species that live in the whole of the Amazon basin today, but only three are ever found in the same area and they rarely share the same habitat. The large number of cayman found in Pebas has been described by the researchers leading the excavation as 'hyperdiverse'. Dr Rodolfo Salas Gismondi, from the University of Montpelier in France, said the huge wetland habitat that covered the area led to an explosion in the number of crocodile species. He said: 'We have uncovered this special momen in time when the ancient mega-wetaland ecosystem reached its peak in size and complexity, just before its demise and the start of the modern Amazon River system. 'At this moment, most known cayman groups co-existed. 'Ancient lineages bearing unusual blunt snouts and globular teeth along with those more generalised feeders representing the beginning of what was to come.' The fossils may now help scientists unravel the evolutionary origins of cayman that live in the Amazon basin. They describe the discovery in a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Scientists found fossilised remains of seven ancient caymen species in Pebas, northern Peru, shown above. The fossilised skulls shown above belong to the three new snout nosed caymen species Gnatusuchus pebasensis (a) Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis (b) and the much larger Caiman wannlangstoni (c) The Gnatusuchus pebasensis name is derived from 'Natu', which is Quechua for 'small nose', along with the name of the village where it was found, Pebas, and the Greek for crocodile - Souchos. The animal, which is new to science, is thought to have used its snout as a shovel in to search for shellfish in the muddy depths of the swamps. Dr Salas Gismondi said: 'When we analysed Gnatusuchus bones and realised that it was probably a head-burrowing and shovelling caiman preying on mollusks living in muddy river and swamp bottoms, we knew it was a milestone for understanding proto-Amazonian wetland feeding dynamics.' The scientists also describe a third new species of prehistoric caymen called Caiman wannlangstoni, which they estimate grew up to 7ft (2.2 metres) long. It is thought to have resembled the broad-snouted caymen that lives in fresh water marshes and swamps thought out central and eastern south America. Caiman wannlangstoni, one of the new species, resembled the broad snouted caymen pictured above.

But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF  projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer.

Ready for launch: video game programmer Richard Garriott shown in training for his space flight in October. Aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich, there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift-off. To gain a better insight into this training, well-known video game programmer and designer Richard Garriott, who is preparing for his own space adventure in October, is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler. Garriott has been in training since the beginning of the year and told CNN the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations. \\"When I first came here in January, I thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time. Of course, very quickly, I realized that I had signed up for a very complex task, something much more difficult that I had anticipated. I immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight. \\"And now that I am so close to the flight, I am still feeling the pressure, I definitively have been working very long days and most nights,\\" Garriott said. The training regime has three major strands: physical training, which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment; practical training for day-to-day living in space; and like any flight, be it 10 minutes or 10 days, training in safety procedures for emergency situations. Trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off-site to complete the requirements, which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet. Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, the company sending Garriott into space, told CNN the training program is extensive, but does not exclude people from making the flight. \\"Their total training program is a few months, but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives. They are not training to the same degree as the professionals.\\" As long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health, they can usually go ahead with their adventure, he said. \\"There's some fitness involved. There are certainly [medical] things that are not allowable in space, but they are generally more serious conditions.\\" He said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in \\"Gs.\\" \\"The body is designed to live on one 'G,' so when you expose it to higher 'Gs' it has an effect.

Ugh, this is definitely my least favorite part of training!\\" Despite such disturbing preparations, Anderson said much of the training, which takes place at Space Adventures' base in Star City, Russia, is centered upon general living in space. \\"There's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat, how to drink, and how to use the restroom, for example,\\" he said. \\"There's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment.\\" Garriott said many of the procedures for living in space, or for emergencies, are very complex. \\"There are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms, plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction; the toilet (everybody's favorite piece of space trivia!), including powering up the can for suction and waste removal; and lastly, onboard water sources.\\" He admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by \\"cramming like any good college kid.\\" And the most fascinating part of the training? In Garriott's opinion, it was running in a hypobaric chamber, where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters (about 2,000 meters higher than Mount Everest). \\"I felt no physical or mental problems, but I did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe. Basically, it was possible to make a tennis ball-sized pocket in my mouth, but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum! \\"By that I mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed,\\" he said. \\"However, at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch! Weird.\\" It truly is.","output":"Space travel might seem exciting, but it's not as simple as people think. First, it's expensive, so only very rich people can go. Second, you need lots of training before you can go to space. A famous video game programmer named Richard Garriott is going to space in October and shared his experiences in a blog. He has been training since January and was surprised by how intense the preparations were. His training includes physical training to get used to space environment, day-to-day living skills in space, and safety procedures for emergencies. Trainees usually spend at least nine months before they are ready for their adventure. As long as people are healthy, they can usually go to space.

Dreams are not directly linked to life or death situations. - Confusion: While confusion might be a possible result of a vivid and intense dream, it does not directly correlate to the specific outcome of hitting the ground in the dream. - Fear: Fear might be an initial emotional reaction to such an experience, but it does not provide a clear connection to the consequence of hitting the ground in the dream. - Might awaken: When people experience a sudden or intense event in their dreams, such as falling or hitting the ground, their bodies might react with a jolt or sudden movement, causing them to wake up. This is called a hypnic jerk. Step 3: Choose the most plausible answer based on the evaluation.

By area, which is the largest state in the USA?","output":"The largest state in the United States by area is Alaska. Alaska is located in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south. With an area of 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers), Alaska is approximately twice the size of the next largest state, Texas, and more than twice the size of the third largest state, California. Alaska was purchased from the Russian Empire in 1867 for 7.2 million, a deal that became known as the \\"Alaska Purchase\\" or \\"Seward's Folly,\\" after U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, who negotiated the agreement. Alaska became the 49th state of the United States on January 3, 1959. Approximately one-third of Alaska lies within the Arctic Circle, which means that it experiences both extreme daylight and darkness during the summer and winter months, respectively. Due to its immense size, Alaska's climate, geography, and natural resources are incredibly diverse. The state boasts the highest mountain peak in North America, Denali (formerly Mt. McKinley), which stands at 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level. Moreover, Alaska is home to vast wilderness areas, expansive forests, numerous rivers, lakes, glaciers, and a rich array of wildlife. One striking feature of Alaska is its extensive coastline, which is not only the longest of any state in the United States but also longer than the combined coastlines of all the other states. Thanks to this coastline, Alaska boasts a robust fishing and seafood industry, which serves as one of the state's primary economic engines. While it holds the title of the largest state by area, Alaska has a relatively low population density. Most of its residents are concentrated in urban areas, such as Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau (the state capital), which are connected to the rest of the country and world by air and sea transportation. The state's vast and remote wilderness, as well as its harsh winters, create logistical and infrastructure challenges for the people who call Alaska home. Nevertheless, Alaskans have cultivated a reputation for their rugged individualism and close-knit communities, shaped by their unique and sometimes harsh environment. In conclusion, the largest state in the United States by area is Alaska, covering an impressive 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers). Alaska's diverse and dramatic landscape, encompassing towering mountains, vast forests, and an extensive coastline, reflects its immense size. Despite its enormous land area, low population density characterizes Alaska, with its residents primarily concentrated in urban centers. Alaska's unique environment and remote location have shaped its rich culture and way of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada  for the following movie plot:  Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago.

Given the question: Process:  - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person starts to hyperventilate happens, how will it affect more oxygen travels to the lungs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. When a person starts to hyperventilate, their breathing becomes rapid and shallow. This increases the rate at which oxygen enters the body and travels to the lungs. Let's break down the effects step-by-step: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: Hyperventilation causes more rapid and shallow breaths, resulting in more oxygen entering the body than during normal breathing. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: With increased breathing rate, more oxygen reaches the lungs in a shorter amount of time. However, shallow breaths may not allow for the most efficient gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): Because more oxygen is present in the blood due to hyperventilation, more oxygen binds to the hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: As the heart continues to pump blood throughout the body, it delivers these oxygen-rich erythrocytes to various tissues. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: With increased oxygen availability, cells may receive more oxygen than they would under normal breathing conditions. However, this can be offset by the potential decrease in gas exchange efficiency caused by the rapid and shallow breaths of hyperventilation. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that hyperventilation directly affects the process of oxygen entering the body, traveling to the lungs, and binding to hemoglobin in erythrocytes. This may lead to an increase in oxygen available for cells, but the actual impact depends on the balance between the increased oxygen intake and the efficiency of gas exchange during hyperventilation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Irwin was born on his mother's birthday to Lyn and Bob Irwin in Essendon, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. He was of Irish descent on his father's side. He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School. Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a wildlife rehabilitator. On 4 September 2006, Irwin was on location at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, taking part in the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television programme.  While swimming in chest-deep water, Irwin approached a stingray with an approximate span of two metres (6.5 ft) from the rear, in order to film it swimming away.  According to the incident's only witness, \\"All of a sudden [the stingray] propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail. Hundreds of strikes in a few seconds\\". Irwin initially believed he only had a punctured lung. However, the stingray's barb pierced his heart, causing him to bleed to death. The stingray's behaviour appeared to have been a defensive response to being boxed in. Crew members aboard Irwin's boat administered CPR and rushed him to the nearby Low Isles where medical staff pronounced him dead.  Irwin's death is believed to be the only fatality from a stingray ever captured on video.  Footage of the incident was viewed by Queensland state police as part of their mandatory investigations. All copies of the footage were then destroyed at the behest of Irwin's family. Production was completed on Ocean's Deadliest, which was broadcast in the US on the Discovery Channel on 21 January 2007. The documentary was completed with footage shot in the weeks following the accident, but without including any mention of Irwin's accidental death.

Over the years, he had been largely forgotten by the townspeople, living out his days in solitude and bitterness.  One fateful day, Old Joe's life takes a dark and twisted turn as he discovers the truth about the untimely deaths of his wife and son some 30 years prior. A secret letter, carelessly left behind, reveals that three children in town were involved in the tragic accident that took their lives, all because of a misguided prank they carried out to scare Old Joe's wife, who was pregnant at the time. Consumed by grief and undying anger, Old Joe determines that the only way to serve justice for his lost family is to take matters into his own hands. He crafts an elaborate plan to hunt down and kill each of the now-grown culprits. As his plot unfolds, the town is gripped in fear with outsiders being the first to point fingers at Old Joe. However, the townspeople refuse to believe that Old Joe is responsible for the heinous acts committed against the children of their town. Little do they know, the truth is right under their nose, and it's a nightmare they're not prepared to face. Meanwhile, each of the three individuals involved in the accident starts to receive chilling warnings from Old Joe and tries to pick up the pieces of their fragmented past in hopes of finding redemption with each other and dealing with the guilt that's been haunting them for decades. On the eve of his final strike, Old Joe confronts the last child responsible for the accident in a chilling moment of truth and realization. The town begins to uncover the secrets long buried within their midst, grappling with the reality that the quiet old man determined to avenge the death of his son was one of their own. In the end, Old Joe is caught by the local authorities, leading to a shocking climax filled with acts of desperation and violence. As the truth comes to light, both Old Joe and the survivors are forced to reconcile with their past, present, and future.

In this case, heaviness is the primary factor preventing the child from lifting the box. Let's analyze the other options: - Toxic: Lead is indeed toxic, but toxicity is not the issue presented in the question. The focus is on lifting the box, not the potential health risks of lead. - Light: This option contradicts the context. If the box was light, the child would be able to lift it easily. - Isolated from sulphide pbs: This option refers to the chemical composition of lead and how it could be extracted from its ores. It is irrelevant to the weight and lifting of the box. - Very dense: Although lead is a very dense material, and density contributes to the overall weight of an object, the question is more directly related to the weight of the box as it prevents the child from lifting it.

Let's break down the elements of both the premise and hypothesis to understand why this is the case. Premise elements: 1. A little girl: The premise describes a single child, a little girl, as the main subject. Gender and age are also indicated in this description. 2. Bright pink pants: The little girl's attire is mentioned, specifically focusing on her bright pink pants. 3. Playfully: The girl's behavior is described as light-hearted and fun. 4. Sticks her face in a contraption: The girl's specific activity is depicted as placing her face in some type of contraption or structure. 5. On a playground: The setting of the scene is established as a playground. Hypothesis elements: 1. Playing dodgeball: The hypothesis suggests a specific game being played, which is dodgeball. 2. With her friends: The hypothesis implies the presence and involvement of the girl's friends. Comparing the elements of the premise with those of the hypothesis, the following observations are apparent: 1. Both the premise and hypothesis involve a little girl as the main subject. 2. The premise identifies the location as a playground, which could be consistent with the hypothesis, as dodgeball can be played on a playground. 3. The girl's attire and behavior in the premise (wearing bright pink pants and playing playfully) do not provide information about the type of game or activity she is engaged in. 4. The girl's actions in the premise (sticking her face in a contraption) do not correlate with the game of dodgeball described in the hypothesis. Dodgeball involves throwing and dodging balls, not sticking one's face into contraptions. The presence of a little girl on a playground, as described in the premise, is not enough to confirm that she is participating in a dodgeball game with her friends, as stated in the hypothesis. Furthermore, the girl's activity of sticking her face in a contraption does not align with the typical actions associated with playing dodgeball. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine if the hypothesis is true or not."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

English language: It uses the Latin alphabet, tends to have words with word order syntax (SVO), and you are more likely to be familiar with the words in English. Yoruba language: It is a Niger-Congo language spoken predominantly in southwest Nigeria, with words often containing diacritical marks like à, ẹ, ọ, and ọ́, and typically follow a subject-verb-object (SVO) order. Step 3: Compare the given sentence with the characteristics of both languages mentioned in step 2. In this step, we analyze the sentence: - Ẹni ọgbọ̀n (30) ọdún ni Arákùnrinr Kokkinakis nígbà tọ́rọ̀ yìí wáyé, àtìgbà yẹn náà ló ti ń jà fún ẹ̀tọ́ tó ní láti wàásù, odindi àádọ́ta (50) ló sì fi ja ìjà yìí.

Answer: Yoruba"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: This is a good film for 99% of the duration. I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim. It is shot in a rather naive fashion. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique. The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called Joe. However, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT. The film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of 'B' movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence. After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed. I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film. Give it a watch and excuse the ending! Now, what is this review like? Possible answers: i. negative. ii. positive.","output":"This review is a mix of both positive and negative. The person who wrote the review liked many things about the film, like the 'eeriness' and the acting of the creepy characters. But they didn't like the ending and thought some characters were too pathetic. So, they gave it a 7 out of 10, which means it's good but has some flaws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
