Julius Caesar Answer:","output":"Title: The 12 Trials of Gaul In the year 52 BC, after years of relentless warfare and battles between the Romans and the Gauls, Julius Caesar (played by Ralph Fiennes) finally conquers the last Gallic stronghold, led by the brave and charismatic chieftain, Vercingetorix (played by Vincent Cassel). While the Roman Empire thrives, the Gauls now find themselves under the strict rule and occupation of the Romans. A small Gallic village, however, manages to resist the oppressive Roman forces through their unbreakable unity, courage, and determination, as well as a magic potion created by their wise and cunning druid, Getafix (played by Ian McKellen). The village's most iconic warriors, the strong and courageous Asterix (played by Tom Hardy) and his large but dim-witted best friend, Obelix (played by Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson), have become a symbol of hope and inspiration for the unity of Gauls. Upon hearing about this indomitable village, Caesar becomes determined to crush them once and for all. However, rather than resorting to brute force, he decides on a more cunning plan. He challenges the Gauls to complete a series of 12 seemingly impossible tasks within 30 days. If they succeed, he vows to release the Gauls from Roman rule, but if they fail, their village will be destroyed, and Gaul will be under Roman control forever. With no other choice, Asterix and Obelix embark on a dangerous and thrilling adventure, facing each challenge with wit and courage, while also forming alliances with unlikely allies along the way, such as a fierce female warrior named Serena (played by Gal Gadot). During their journey, the heroes also uncover a plot by a traitorous Gaul (played by Adrien Brody) to undermine their chances and ensure Roman domination. Through teamwork, quick thinking, and bravery, Asterix and Obelix manage to overcome all 12 challenges, eventually earning the respect of Caesar himself. As the village celebrates their victory in their final stand against the Roman Empire, Caesar learns valuable lessons about the importance of loyalty, brotherhood, and the enduring power of freedom. By honoring his word, Caesar releases Gaul from Roman rule and establishes a peaceful alliance with the newly united nation, marking a new chapter in European history. The thrilling and inspirational tale of 'The 12 Trials of Gaul' highlights themes of courage, friendship, unity, and standing up against tyranny, leaving audiences moved and filled with a sense of hope and empowerment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese netizens have always been divided over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China. And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. Top South Korean actors Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo Hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24.8 percent in their country, considered strong by Nielsen Korea. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero in You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements: a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs portray the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella-type stories. The growing wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their search for a better life might have prompted   many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray. In fact, South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market's demands. In contrast, Chinese TV screens are flooded by knock-off   or poorly made soap operas. There are too many Chinese TV dramas that are either of the stereotyped   war theme or just blindly copy foreign programs. The lack of good stories has resulted in loads of TV series on time travel or fights in the harems   of Qing Dynastyemperors. These, in short, are the pain of Chinese TV...

During the course of the film, it is revealed that Sam has changed dramatically and is not the person he was six years ago. He has learnt from his mistakes and is still haunted by his crime. Sam is later on a bus and witnesses two occupants give their seat up to a woman. He also sees another man staring at him. Later, when he visits Trife's grave at Oak Park cemetery, the man he saw earlier sits next to him. He says his name is Jehvon and starts a conversation with him. Later in the conversation, the man brings up the murder and attacks Sam. He turns out to be Trife's cousin, and he wounds Sam. However, Sam is later able to gain control of the fight and beats him into submission. Trife's cousin informs him that he will not survive the day, as many people want him dead â and will stop at nothing, not even harming his family. Sam, troubled by these claims, goes to his house and breaks in. However, no one is home, so Sam bandages up his wound. He then has a flashback to his prison days which reveals he helped a high ranking prison mate escape an attack from Trife's uncle, Curtis. Sam then goes into a room, goes through the drawers and picks up a gun which he discards, then leaves. Sam later visits Claire and asks for information regarding his mother, saying he won't hurt her, however Claire says she hasn't seen his mother in over a year, and also tells him that Mooney is at university, and that that's all she knows. Then Claire's partner Hayden arrives, and attacks Sam when he realises who he is, berating him for all the emotional damage he caused Claire six years ago. Sam then visits Mooney and asks for information regarding anyone who might hurt his family. He says he has changed, however Mooney reveals...

It's early in the morning, but the soldiers in their camouflage uniforms have already been awake for several hours. They're getting their gear ready, making sure all of their safety equipment, hooks, belts, and straps are in working order. Nothing seems out of the ordinary, until you take a closer look. Among the 270 recruits getting their basic paratrooper training, there are 71 women. After a 50-minute check-up, they all board military planes that will take off from the Santa Lucia Military Air Base near Mexico City. This is the first time in 22 years that women in the Mexican armed forces are being trained as paratroopers. The program was suspended in 1989 for unspecified reasons. Now it's back again, but officials haven't said if it will instituted permanently. Once they reach an altitude of 1,500 feet, it's time to jump and put into practice the four weeks of training they have received. It's a small jump for these women soldiers, but one giant leap for the Mexican military. Corporal Raquel Gutierrez is among the first women who signed up for paratrooper training. \\"I think this is an activity that only a few can do. We are a group of women who have decided to enter a space previously reserved for men,\\" Gutierrez says. For the Mexican military, training women as paratroopers means more personnel at the ready; many in Mexico also see this training as an important step towards gender equality. Basic paratrooper training in the Mexican military takes four weeks. Trainees have the opportunity to jump off a plane five times. For Corporal Norma Flores being part of this training is one of the most exciting things she's done in her life. \\"It's a very beautiful experience and, honestly, I'm very proud. I want to learn a lot of things here in the Army and, well, it's a good opportunity to serve our country,\\" Flores says. Army officials say the training that these women are going through is exactly the same men take. There's no special treatment or relaxing of the rules. The goal is that paratroopers are equally trained, capable, and safe, regardless of their gender. Colonel Bernardino Olvera, who's in charge of this phase of paratrooper training, says safety and preparedness are paramount. \\"We can't make any distinctions [between men and women] because there are no parachutes for men or women. Training has to be the same,\\" Olvera says. First Sergeant Miriam Rivera says that, after all, the fear you feel right before jumping off the plane has no gender. \\"It's true that you always have some fear, but with the training that we have received during the whole month we learn to change fear for an adrenaline rush in order to jump off the plane,\\" Rivera says. Once the training is over, the seven female officers and 64 soldiers will return to their normal duties. the Mexican Army has yet to establish the option of being a paratrooper as a career choice for women entering the forces, a limitation that based on this training may be about to change. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article discusses the Mexican military's reintroduction of paratrooper training for women after a 22-year suspension.

What is the final step of the following process: -  The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of the given process, after too much heat is trapped, involves the Earth's climate system reacting in order to restore balance and stabilize temperatures. This is achieved through various mechanisms that ultimately aim to distribute and/or dissipate the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere. When an excessive amount of heat is trapped by the atmosphere, the Earth's climate system undergoes adjustments in an attempt to regain equilibrium. These adjustments can take several forms, including: 1. Redistribution of heat through atmospheric circulation: The Earth's atmosphere comprises a complex system of air currents and pressure systems that distribute heat across the planet. When an imbalance occurs due to excessive heat being trapped, these circulation patterns can alter to help redistribute the surplus heat. This might involve a strengthening or weakening of specific atmospheric currents, leading to changes in weather patterns and regional climates. 2. Redistribution of heat through ocean circulation: The oceans are vast reservoirs of heat and play a crucial role in distributing and balancing temperature across the Earth's surface. When an excessive amount of heat is trapped by the atmosphere, ocean current systems such as the Gulf Stream and thermohaline circulation can also adjust to help redistribute the excess heat. This can result in changes to marine ecosystems, sea surface temperatures, and regional climate patterns. 3. Increased evapotranspiration: As the Earth's surface becomes warmer, the rate of evaporation from bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, as well as transpiration from plants, increases. This process, collectively known as evapotranspiration, functions as a natural cooling mechanism. The additional moisture released into the atmosphere contributes to cloud formation, which can help to reflect incoming solar radiation back into space, thereby reducing the amount of heat trapped by the atmosphere. 4. Melting of polar ice caps and glaciers: When there is an excess of heat trapped, the polar ice caps and glaciers may begin to melt at an accelerated rate. This release of freshwater into the oceans can lead to a rise in global sea levels and disrupt the thermohaline circulation mentioned above. Moreover, the decrease in reflective ice surfaces can contribute to further warming, as more solar radiation is absorbed by the darker ocean surfaces. 5. Changes in vegetation: Increased temperatures can lead to alterations in ecosystems, such as shifts in vegetation patterns and species migration. These changes can impact the Earth's overall ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide, which, in turn, can influence the greenhouse effect and the amount of heat trapped in the atmosphere. The final step of the given process, after too much heat is trapped, sees the Earth's climate system attempting to restore balance through various mechanisms that help to redistribute and dissipate the excess heat. These natural processes are interconnected and depend on many factors. However, it's important to note that human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly contributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect, which has made it more challenging for the Earth's climate system to maintain a balanced state. Consequently, addressing these anthropogenic factors is crucial in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and sustain the Earth's ability to stabilize its temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3. U-571 This 2000 film was directed by Jonathan Mostow and starred Mathew MacConaughey, Havey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi. It took place during the Second World War(1939--1945).

Tragedy: The 38-year-old died instantly after being struck by the Toyota Land Cruiser on a dirt track near the world's largest salt flats while her husband tailed around 200 metres behind. The couple were on the 19,000 mile-leg of the trip from south America to north Alaska when charity worker Sharon was struck from behind and knocked off her bike, just after 4.30pm on Saturday. The unnamed Bolivian man involved in the accident was arrested at the scene and is now in custody awaiting a court appearance. A local police spokesman said the accident happened after Sharon swerved to the left and caught the him by surprise. Last night members of Okehampton Cycling Club, which the couple have belonged to for nearly a decade, spoke of their shock at the news. Thumbs up: Mr and Mrs Bridgman pictured in Argentina last year at the start of their 19,000 mile-leg of the trip from south America to north Alaska which they were part-way through when she died. The couple, from Zeal Monachorum near Okehampton, Devon, were nearly two years into a fundraising cycle trip for Cornwall-based disaster relief charity ShelterBox spanning 32 countries across three continents. Club chairman Robert Szembek said: 'I only found out about the tragedy yesterday and am still in a state of shock. 'Everyone was following an Internet blog they were writing and they appeared to be having a great time and making lots of new friends. 'They'd already done what I would describe as some of the more dangerous countries on their route through Africa without any real problems. 'Tim had his bike stolen at one point and had to have a replacement flown out but that was the worst thing that had happened. 'My heart goes out to him. I haven't been able to talk to him but it goes without saying that he must be suffering immensely.' A friend added: 'They'd been cycling virtually non-stop since June 2012 but were going to break their journey in early July to come back to Britain for a friend's wedding. 'I don't know what he'll do now. All we've been told is that Sharon has been killed but we don't really know any more details than that.' The couple, pictured in Ushuaia in southern Argentina, were on the 19,000 mile-leg from south America to north Alaska when the charity worker was struck and knocked off her bike just after 4.30pm on Saturday. Adventurers: Mrs Bridgman wife her carpenter husband Tim in Nordkapp, Norway, on June 4, 2012, the first day of their rouind-the-world trip. Carpenter Tim set off with his wife from Nordkapp in Norway on June 4 2012. They cycled nearly 16,000 miles through 23 countries in Europe and Africa including Turkey, Egypt, Sudan and war-torn Ethiopia before arriving in Cape Agulhas in South Africa last November. They then took a plane to Ushuaia in southern Argentina to start their 19,000 mile ride, called the 'North to North cycle tour', to northern Alaska. Sharon, who did most of the writing, told in a diary entry on their travel blog posted just five days before Sunday's tragedy how they had spent a night on the outskirts of Chilean capital Santiago with firefighters before heading to meet a friend they had made earlier on their trip. She joked how Tim was taunted by a mosquito 'that had been on a three-week diet and was trying to catch up on many missed meals' in a farewell sign-off. Describing a hair-raising moment in an April 2013 post, written near the Ethiopian town of Sodo, Tim told how around 50 kids ran alongside them on a dirt track trying to grab their belongings from their bike and throwing stones at them. 'He must be suffering immensely': Mr Bridgman (pictured in Chile this year) is understood to be receiving support from British diplomats. He wrote: 'We were close to the edge of town when one hit Sharon on the head. 'It was the last straw. We stopped and tried explaining our thoughts to the adults but they just smiled and shrugged their shoulders. 'It was like riding through wild animals.' Sharon, who rode from Land's End to John O'Groats with her husband in 2005, had to give up impact sports several years ago because of serious back problems. The problems forced her to take seven months off work in 2007 and she had several spinal injections to help ease the pain. Speaking shortly before they set out, Tim said: 'Standing for a long period of time is still a problem but cycling seems to be the one thing that is okay. 'With determination and incredible support from family and friends over the years it has become managable enough to do this trip.' Ready to go: Mr and Mrs Bridgman arrive in Ushuaia, Argentina, to start their 19,000-mile ride, called the 'North to North cycle tour' to northern Alaska. Local police chief Marcelo Tejerina confirmed: 'Mrs Bridgman died just after 4pm on Saturday local time after being hit by a Toyota Land Cruiser driven by a Bolivian man on a dirt track near Villamar, around 125 miles south of Uyuni. She was killed instantly. 'Her husband who was cycling around 200 metres behind was unhurt. 'The driver stopped and called police. He has now been arrested and his vehicle impounded which is standard practice after a fatal road accident and he is in custody awaiting a court appearance scheduled to take place later today. 'Both the driver and the tourist were travelling in the same direction from Villamar to Uyuni and were about 125 miles from the Chilean border. 'Mrs Bridgman appears to have swerved to the left for reasons that are unclear and taken the driver by surprise.' British diplomats are understood to be assisting Mr Bridgman. His wife's body has been flown to the Bolivian capital La Paz ahead of its repatriation to the UK. The city of Uyuni is a major tourist draw for holidaymakers visiting the nearby salt flat, which sits near the top of the Andes at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. It is the world's largest salt flat, covering more than 4,000 square miles and containing up to 70 per cent of the world's lithium reserves. At the time of her death, Sharon and her husband had raised just over £1,000 of their £10,000 target for ShelterBox. The charity provides emergency shelter and vital supplies to support communities around the world overwhelmed by disaster and humanitarian crisis. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Bolivia on April 26. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

Even though you have to get on a plane the next day. I couldn’t help myself. Marco, who I had already made turn 180 degrees to drive back to the truck, gave me that look of disapproval when I want to do something totally unreasonable like impulse buy citrus fruit that we can’t keep. “What are we going to do with these?” He questioned. I wasn’t sure. I wanted to taste them, I wanted to photograph them. And maybe I could even squeeze some of them into our tiny bag to take home. “It won’t be a waste, I’ll give the rest away!” I reasoned. He just shook his head, giving in. I bought them, a big grin on my face. We were just outside the port city of Taranto, on the western coast of Puglia in Italy’s deep south, where we spent a long weekend recently and where clementines have special IGP (Protected Geographical Indication) status. These clementines — a hybrid of oranges and mandarins — grow in the fertile soil around the gulf of Taranto, particularly around the town of Palagiano (also known as “the city of clementines” — they celebrate the symbol of their city with a sagra, a food festival, every December) and the delicate fruit is harvested by hand. We don’t get these in Florence, it was my only chance to taste them – they are small with very few, if any, seeds, and they are very sweet. Question: Why did Marco have to make a turn back?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Deni Kirkova. An obese mother-of-one has shed almost half her body weight to land her dream job as a PE teacher. Amy Richardson, 29, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, felt her ambition was slipping away because of her weight, which had rocketed to over 19 stone. Although she had studied sports development at university, Amy always felt a fraud because she was so big she had to wear men's sportswear, and couldn't walk up two flights of stairs without getting out breath. Amy pictured before the weight loss, left, and now, right, as Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2014. Amy, who said she had always been a 'chubby child', often felt self-conscious when wearing a leotard for her favourite hobby of trampolining. But by going on a life-changing diet she managed to lose 7st 11lb, and slimmed from a size 24 to a slender 12. Now 11st 4.5lb, Amy finally teaches sports at a secondary school and feels full of energy, enjoying exercise and eating healthy home-made meals with her 17-month-old daughter Emily. She said her weight began to effect her everyday life when she went to university. 'It was the first time I'd lived away from home, I was eating all the wrong things and going out with my friends most nights. 'At the time I didn't think about what I. was eating and drinking at all, but looking back it's no wonder my. weight went up to more than 19 stone.' Amy Richardson lost almost 8 stone to achieve her childhood dream of becoming a PE teacher. She continued: 'My joints ached, I got out of breath. easily and I lost all my confidence. On nights out I'd just sit in the. corner while all my friends were on the dance floor. 'I felt like a fraud. I was doing sports development at. university, yet I found it difficult to climb the two flights of stairs. to my lectures and had to wear men's sportswear because of my size. 'I couldn't imagine any school wanting to employ an overweight PE teacher and I knew I needed to do something.' Her mother Lynne joined Slimming World in 2005, and a few months later Amy went along too, after a friend agreed to go with her. The effect was almost immediate. She cooked recipes from their website, and ditched takeaways and microwave meals in favour of making food from scratch. Her favourite things to cook include home made burgers with extra lean mince, homemade chips, and jacket potatoes with beans and salad. 'I taught myself how to cook lots of healthy meals and found things that I'd thought were bland before tasted so much better when I made them myself. 'I could still have treats like chocolate or alcohol too, so I didn't have to miss out on nights out, and lots of my friends didn't even realise I was slimming.' She added: 'Before I went to the. group I was scared, I worried what people would think of me and though I. might be the biggest person there. 'After a few weeks I saw how well it worked - I was even Slimmer of the Month - and I was hooked.' As the pounds melted away, Amy's energy and fitness levels improved, along with her confidence. Amy celebrates her weight loss at the Ritz Hotel in London today. After leaving university five stone slimmer, she successfully got a job as a PE teacher in 2008. 'I couldn't believe I'd achieved my dream and had the job I'd always wanted. There's no way I'd have been able to do this job at 19 stone. 'Now I can keep up with the kids, demonstrate things I want them to do, and I don't have to worry about my size at all. 'I've lost another 2st 11lbs since I've been at the school, and I think it's good for my students to see that I haven't followed some silly fad diet, I've lost weight sensibly and kept it off.' Amy, mother to 17-month-old Emily, has lost another 2st 11lbs since teaching at the school. Amy, who lives with fiance Chris and their daughter, has carried on with the classes every week, even during her pregnancy. She said: 'I always joke that I've taken the scenic route to my weight-loss journey. Right from the start I was determined that I didn't want a quick fix, I wanted to make a change for life, and I know I've definitely done that. 'I've never felt like I was missing out, and eating healthily and being active are just part of my life now. 'I know I'll be able to pass everything Slimming World's taught me onto Emily so she'll never have to struggle with her weight like I did, which is an amazing feeling. 'I've got the figure I always wanted, my dream job, the perfect fiance and a beautiful baby girl. Being named Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2014 is just the icing on the cake.'

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  Now, I have a new situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Answer this question please: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A, as it has a higher respiration rate, indicating that cellular respiration is occurring, which is the process that generates ATP molecules. Sample B has no respiration rate, implying that there is no cellular respiration and thus, no production of ATP molecules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Since the question assumes that less sediment is being transported, it implies that there could be weaker winds or less frequent wind occurrences. As a result, the sediment breaks down into small particles step will still occur, but these smaller particles will be less likely to be picked up by the wind.

Question: Question: \\"How did Verban act towards the fan club\\"  Context: \\"In 1975, a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington, D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society. The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans, currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban, who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run. Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player, explains columnist George Will, because \\"He exemplified mediocrity under pressure, he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics.\\" Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed, but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan, also a society member, at the White House. Hillary Clinton, Jim Belushi, Joe Mantegna, Rahm Emanuel, Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Emil Verban's initial reaction towards the fan club, namely the Emil Verban Society, was a mix of confusion and feelings of being ridiculed. Verban, a former Major League Baseball player known for his time with the Chicago Cubs in the 1940s, was characterized by his mediocrity and work ethics, which were traits the Emil Verban Society seemed to celebrate. This exclusive club included high-profile Cubs fans and public figures, such as politicians, actors, and entertainers. When Verban learned about the society dedicated to him, he initially thought he was the subject of mockery. It is not hard to see why he might have felt that way: the Emil Verban Society was formed to honor his performance as the epitome of an average, competent but unnoticed player. Being known for mediocrity might have triggered feelings of insecurity and doubt in Verban. However, Verban's ill feelings towards the fan club were dispelled when he was invited to Washington, D.C., a few years after the society's foundation. This invitation marked a turning point in Verban's attitude towards the Emil Verban Society and its members. The society had gained notoriety, and its membership consisted of big names such as President Ronald Reagan, Hillary Clinton, Jim Belushi, Joe Mantegna, Rahm Emanuel, and Dick Cheney, among others. Upon meeting President Ronald Reagan, who was a member of the Emil Verban Society, Verban became aware that the group had a different purpose than he initially thought. The society embraced Verban's qualities, showing that those considered \\"mediocre\\" could still garner admiration and respect. The Emil Verban Society's true intention was to celebrate the hard work and dedication that Verban put into his baseball career, even if that work did not always manifest into exceptional results on the field. In conclusion, Emil Verban's attitude towards the fan club named after him underwent a significant transformation. He started with feelings of ridicule and insecurity but eventually realized that the Emil Verban Society appreciated and respected him for his dedication and work ethics.

While Derek is at work, he greets temporary worker Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, attempts to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party and flashing him in his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room and rapes him. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help. After repeated attempts to reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek at the hospital and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile.

Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'movement' with the subject 'james brooks '.  Choices: - abstract expressionism  - cubism  - modern art  - surrealism The answer is:","output":"- abstract expressionism James Brooks, as an American muralist and abstract painter, is associated with the movement of abstract expressionism. This art movement, which gained momentum in the mid-20th century, emphasizes spontaneous and expressive gestures and techniques. It is characterized by non-representational, abstract forms that attempt to convey emotions and concepts through non-traditional methods like dripping, splattering, and gestural brushstrokes. Abstract expressionism diverged from the traditional methods of art that were prominent in earlier times. It rejected the need for a specific subject or representation in favor of personal expression and the raw power of the artistic process. This style emphasized the individual intentions and emotions of the artist, making it a direct response to the societal pressures and constraints of the post-World War II era. James Brooks was involved in this movement and contributed to its development through his unique approach to painting. As a part of the abstract expressionist movement, his work reflects the abstract nature of this artistic style, which stands in sharp contrast to the other choices offered. Cubism, surrealism, and modern art, though important and influential movements in the history of art, do not have the specific connection to James Brooks' work as abstract expressionism does. While he may have been influenced by the broader category of modern art, it is abstract expressionism which directly associates with his artistry."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock.  But I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? The answer is:","output":"Big lake had less occurrences of divers drowning. While both lakes presented their unique challenges, Big lake and Arrow lake can be compared based on factors leading to drowning incidents. To understand the comparison better, it is crucial first to analyze the different characteristics and risks associated with each lake. Arrow lake, located to the south, had a river flowing into it. This led to the formation of a thermocline, a sudden change in temperature, where cold, fresh water from the river floated over the denser saline water, causing the temperature to rise as the diver descended. As a result, divers experienced temperature shock, leading to many drowning incidents in Arrow lake. On the other hand, Big lake exhibited evidence of underwater geothermal activity. This activity caused the deeper waters to be warmer than the surface waters, leading to convection currents. Although these convection currents could potentially pose challenges to divers, they did not result in the same level of temperature shock or the corresponding risk of drowning compared to Arrow lake. While both lakes had thermoclines, the risk of drowning associated with temperature shock was more prominent in Arrow lake. The distinct temperature gradients created by the river flowing into Arrow lake produced a higher probability of temperature shock for divers, significantly increasing the risk of drowning in comparison to the geothermal activity found in Big lake. Therefore, Big lake had less occurrences of divers drowning, primarily due to the milder temperature changes caused by the geothermal activity and the resulting convection currents. The more significant temperature shock risk associated with the river flow into Arrow lake contributed to a greater number of drowning incidents and highlighted Big lake as the safer option between the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Abstract: Mechanical ventilation was able to induce a decrease in cardiac output and regional blood flow, especially hepatic flow. Thus, hepatic elimination of drugs with a high hepatic-extraction ratio, which was linked to alteration in hepatic blood flow, could be reduced during mechanical ventilation. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine, which is a well-known nonrestrictive elimination drug at the hepatic level. Five patients (mean age, 58 years) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gasometric parameters before and after weaning from mechanical ventilation were studied. With a washout period of 48 hours between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation, each patient was submitted to the following protocol: lidocaine in a bolus (1.5 mg/kg intravenously), followed by infusion (1.0 to 1.7 mg/min for 120 minutes). The results were that the peak plasma concentration after the bolus during mechanical ventilation was 3.22 +/- 0.37 mg/L (mean +/- SE) vs 2.40 +/- 0.35 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.02). Steady-state plasma concentration during mechanical ventilation was 2.10 +/- 0.20 mg/L vs 1.64 +/- 0.16 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Total clearance was 604.2 +/- 87.0 ml/min during mechanical ventilation vs 775.0 +/- 112.1 ml/min during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Elimination half-life was 245.2 +/- 50.6 minutes during mechanical ventilation vs 160.0 +/- 40.6 minutes during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.05). Distribution volume was 188.6 +/- 50.2 L during mechanical ventilation and 183.0 +/- 50.8 L during spontaneous ventilation (not significant). These preliminary data clearly demonstrated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of dosage adjustment of such a highly hepatic-extracted drug in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation remains to be investigated.

The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The premier of Manitoba is Brian Pallister of the PC Party. The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats. The NDP holds 14 seats, and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature. The last provincial general election was held on 19 April 2016. The province is represented in federal politics by 14 Members of Parliament and six Senators.Manitoba's judiciary consists of the Court of..., can you guess it ?

However, we can attempt to understand the likely sentiment based on the content of the tweet. Tweet: @acryfromthesoul my turn my turn!!! Based on the available text, the sentiment of the tweet appears to be positive or neutral. The user seems to be excited or eager, as indicated by the repetition of \\"my turn\\" and the exclamation points. It can be inferred that the user might be referring to an activity or conversation in which they would like to participate. Furthermore, the use of exclamation points typically conveys a sense of excitement, enthusiasm, or urgency. If the context indeed revolves around an activity or event with multiple participants, the sentiment could be interpreted as anticipation or mild impatience for taking one's turn in said activity. It is essential to remember that understanding the exact context of the tweet would help provide a more nuanced interpretation of the sentiment. For instance, if the user is playfully urging another Twitter user to let them join an ongoing conversation or game, the sentiment would be light-hearted and positive. Overall, it is safe to deduce that the sentiment of this tweet is most likely positive or neutral, reflecting enthusiasm and eagerness to participate.

They claim that \\"the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories in their initial grouping of samples\\". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as Caucasians prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. This is claimed to limit and skew interpretations, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity. They argue that however significant the empirical research, these studies use the term race in conceptually imprecise and careless ways. They suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race. \\"For empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled races.\\" Q: Cladistics can limit and skew what?","output":"Cladistics, when used to support concepts of race in human categorization, can limit and skew interpretations of genetic variation, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity.

Is this review positive or negative?","output":"The review you provided is negative. It expresses dissatisfaction with the current state of food and service at the establishment, as compared to previous times when those aspects were considered to be of a much higher quality. The reviewer states that they won't be returning to the place and even goes to the extent of recommending others to spend their money elsewhere. The key factors contributing to the negative nature of this review are: 1. The comparison of past experiences: The fact that the reviewer had previously enjoyed the food and service at this place makes the negative critique of the current situation more impactful, as it implies that there has been a noticeable decline in quality or standard. 2. The occasion: Since the visit was to celebrate a birthday, an event typically associated with higher expectations and a desire for an enjoyable experience, the disappointment expressed in the review carries additional weight. A negative experience on a special occasion might exacerbate the dissatisfaction felt by the reviewer. 3. The lack of intent to return: The statement about not going back to the establishment serves as a direct indicator that the experience was decidedly unfavorable and has caused the reviewer to sever ties with the place. 4. The advice to others: By suggesting others to allocate their money elsewhere, the reviewer is actively discouraging potential patrons from visiting the establishment, which further emphasizes their negative perception of the current quality of food and service. In summary, this review is negative because it highlights a disappointment with the decline in food and service quality at the establishment, especially when compared to previous experiences. The review not only states that the author won't be returning to the place but also recommends others to avoid it and consider alternative options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The wooden pulpit is massive, measuring approximately from the base to the top. To the east of the south door are churchwardens' box pews carved with Gothic details and poppyheads. They bear a brass plate dated 1770. In the nave are monuments to the memory of the Cliftons of Lytham Hall, including one to Thomas Clifton who died in 1688. A wall tablet commemorates Richard Bradkirk of Bryning Hall who died in 1813 and another monument is to Henry Rishton Buck, a lieutenant aged 27 who died at the Battle of Waterloo. Behind the altar is a folding reredos dated 1900 which was made by Kempe and moved from Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The brass chandelier dated 1725 was made by Brown of Wigan. The organ dates back to 1769 when it was built by Glyn Parker of Salford.

Write an article based on this \\"Design a formal invitation to reflect a formal dress code. Create a fun, playful invitation to showcase a more casual event. Design your invitations to reflect a themed wedding. Match dress code to your venue.\\"","output":"Title: Crafting the Perfect Invitation to Match Your Event's Dress Code and Theme Introduction: Your special event deserves a noteworthy invitation that sets the tone for what's to come. The design of your invitation should not only be aesthetically pleasing, but it should also clearly indicate the dress code and perfectly match the theme and venue of your event. This article will guide you through designing a formal invitation for a strictly formal dress code, creating a playful and fun invitation for a casual event, and crafting a themed wedding invitation. Step 1: Formal Invitation for a Formal Dress Code When preparing a formal invitation, it is essential to create an atmosphere that exudes elegance and sophistication. Here's how to design a formal invitation: 1. Choose a classic color palette: Opt for simple, timeless hues like black, white, gold, or silver, which convey refinement and precision. 2. Use an elegant font: Select an easily readable font with a touch of sophistication. For example, consider script or serif fonts like Edwardian Script or Times New Roman. 3. Incorporate subtle patterns and textures: While keeping the overall design simplistic, add a touch of class with a delicate background pattern or border in a coordinating color. 4. Clearly state the dress code: Ensure your guests know that the event requires formal attire by including a phrase like \\"black-tie affair\\" or \\"formal wear requested\\" on the invitation. Step 2: Playful Invitation for a Casual Event For a laid-back event, your invitation should feel warm, fun, and inviting. Create a playful invitation with these elements: 1. Experiment with vibrant colors: Choose a bright, cheerful color palette to reflect the lively atmosphere of the event. Incorporate colors like teal, fuchsia, or various shades of blue. 2. Play with fonts: Use a combination of exciting, light-hearted fonts to create a sense of whimsy. Consider using modern, handwritten, or decorative fonts like Brush Script or Comic Sans. 3. Add illustrations or graphics: Incorporate playful images – such as balloons, confetti, or streamers – that evoke a sense of amusement and delight. 4. Inform guests of the relaxed dress code: Include phrases like \\"casual attire\\" or \\"come dressed comfortably\\" to set your guests at ease. Step 3: Themed Wedding Invitation A themed wedding necessitates an invitation that accurately conveys the chosen theme and works in harmony with the venue.  1. Reflect the wedding theme: Whether it's a beach, rustic, vintage, or fairytale wedding, let your invitation design represent the theme through color schemes, illustrations, and fonts that harmonize with the overall vision. 2. Adapt the design to the venue: Consider the characteristics of your venue – for example, if your wedding is set in a luxurious ballroom, lean on opulent colors and intricate designs. Conversely, if you've chosen a rustic barn, incorporate wood textures and earthy colors. 3. Personalize the invitation: Add creative elements that represent you and your partner's unique personalities and love story, such as photographs, monograms, or custom illustrations. 4. Specify the required attire: Guide guests on what to wear by indicating the dress code, such as \\"cocktail attire,\\" \\"rustic chic,\\" or \\"beach formal.\\" Conclusion: Your invitation sets the stage for your event, giving guests a first glimpse into the ambiance, dress code, and theme of the celebration. By carefully crafting your invitations to convey the desired atmosphere and adhering to the steps provided in this article, you'll ensure your guests arrive dressed appropriately and excited for the marvelous event you have planned."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sanders, Clinton ramp up campaign before N.Y. primary vote The Democratic presidential contenders spent their last full day of campaigning before Tuesday’s New York primary hitting everything from housing projects to hospitals in a last ditch effort to snag victory in the state they both call home. Although locked in a primary battle that’s pitted Bernie Sanders populism against Hillary Clinton’s long resume, both for the most part kept the mud-slinging at a minimum. FOLLOW THE LATEST NEW YORK PRIMARY NEWS Sanders, who is trailing Clinton in delegates, hit three boroughs, including the Twin Parks West NYCHA development in the Bronx and picketing workers in Midtown Manhattan before capping it off with a Queens rally. BERNIE SANDERS: AN AFFORDABLE HOME FOR EVERY AMERICAN \\"We will not tolerate large profitable corporations sending jobs to low wage countries (while) cutting back on health care benefits — and they're paying their CEO 18 million a year,” Sanders said in front of striking Verizon workers from the Communications Workers of America union on 36th St. “That is the kind of greed that is destroying the American middle class.” Clinton also made multiple stops across the metro region, including St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, a women’s rally at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan, and Kung Fu Tea in Chinatown where she ordered dumplings and bubble tea — her first. HILLARY CLINTON: CHOOSE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE Like Sanders, she focused most of her stump speeches on her campaign message, stressing her long career championing liberal favorites like reproductive rights and support for paid family leave. But Clinton, who is ahead in most polls, also bashed her Republican rivals Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and billionaire Donald Trump. “[It] doesn't help when someone is running for President insulting the religions of a number of the countries we need in the coalitions [to battle terror],” she said of Trump at the rally in Midtown, a shot at Trump’s ban on Muslims entering the U.S. EDITORIAL: HILLARY CLINTON, THE DEMOCRATIC WARRIOR Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was seriously injured in an assassination attempt in 2011, attended the rally to support her, along with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, and First Lady Chirlane McCray. Sanders, meanwhile, got some help from his all-star supporters — the hundreds and hundreds of pumped up everyday voters who flock to his raucous political rallies. The Brooklyn-born Sanders hosted a huge outdoor rally in Long Island City, one day after he drew a 28,000 person crowd in Prospect Park. Summary:","output":"Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, made their final campaign visits in New York before the state's primary vote. Both candidates focused on their campaign messages while visiting places such as housing projects and hospitals in a bid to gain support.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One potential question that could be asked from this paragraph is: Why were the AC-130 gunships not deployed to target Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan, despite the apparent interest from officials such as Berger and Clarke?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet:I can't get into my jobby.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the given tweet, we first need to understand the context of the statement and the possible emotions behind it. The tweet says, \\"I can't get into my jobby.\\" First, let's break down the statement. - \\"I can't get into\\": This part of the sentence indicates some sort of difficulty or obstacle, either physical or emotional. - \\"my jobby\\": This term is ambiguous and can have many potential meanings, such as \\"my job,\\" \\"my hobby,\\" or even just a random word. However, the most common interpretation would be that it refers to \\"my job\\" or \\"my hobby.\\" When analyzing the sentiment of a statement, it is important to determine whether the overall mood is positive, negative, or neutral. Considering the ambiguity of the term \\"jobby,\\" we cannot be completely sure of the context without more information. However, taking the tweet at face value and focusing on the difficulty implied by not being able to \\"get into\\" something, we can assume that this may have a negative undertone. There is an evident sense of frustration or disappointment in not being able to get into their \\"jobby,\\" which might contribute to a negative sentiment. Thus, without any additional information, we can surmise that the sentiment of this tweet leans towards negative emotions. Of course, this is based on the most common interpretation of the term \\"jobby\\" and the understanding that the inability to access it is causing the individual some form of discontent. If additional context were provided, this assessment might change, but with the information given, a detailed analysis suggests a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Question: In what year did Porter handle the sound duties for Ann-Margret? Passage:In December 1969, Presley called Porter to ask him to fix the sound for him in the main showroom at the International Hotel (renamed the Las Vegas Hilton two years later); he said he could not hear himself the last time he sang there, and a new run was scheduled for January. Porter went to see Presley's first rehearsal there, and found three stage monitors hanging high above the stage, with only one working. The hotel's engineers did not get the other two to work, so Porter had some of his own Shure Vocal Master loudspeakers brought over from the recording studio. He laid the column loudspeakers on their sides at the front lip of the stage and propped them up to aim at Presley, who was very happy with the result. Presley insisted upon having Porter mix his live show in January even though he was a recording engineer with no previous experience in live sound. Porter quickly learned about acoustic feedback during the first song, but backstage after the show, film stars and musical artists kept complimenting Presley, telling him that Porter’s concert sound was \\"just like the album\\". Porter mixed Presley's live concerts from then on. Presley paid Porter well for a touring sound engineer; a 1974 contract for nearly two weeks of touring during September–October netted Porter 2,600, an amount equivalent to  in current value. Porter recorded several of these shows in the mid-1970s, released as albums, and witnessed firsthand Presley's physical decline from drug abuse. In 1975, Presley's doctors advised him to exercise more, so he had a racquetball court built at his mansion Graceland. Porter designed and supervised the installation of a powerful high-fidelity Electro-Voice loudspeaker sound system for the racquetball court and an adjoining lounge. On tour, Porter specified the best-sounding, most roadworthy equipment that existed: he used a Midas PRO4 mixing console and UREI equalizers. The tour was supported by Clair Brothers, who supplied all the audio gear and a monitor engineer, Bruce Jackson, who designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. In August 1977, Porter was changing planes in Boston to fly to Portland, Maine, to mix a Presley concert when he received a phone call informing him that the singer had died. He attended Presley's heavily guarded funeral ceremony at Graceland. Between Presley appearances, Porter also handled sound duties for Ann-Margret in Las Vegas and on the road, under the business name Captain Audio Productions. He consulted on television specials for Ann-Margret and for Bob Hope in 1972–1973.

It then asks, \\"the second she did what?\\" which implies that there is a specific, time-sensitive action that allows her to attend to these responsibilities. Step 1: Consider the possible answers in relation to the situation provided. - Make time for: This implies setting aside time for the errands and picking up the kids. However, the question implies a concrete action that enables her to attend to these responsibilities. - Take money: This is unrelated to the context of the question, as it doesn't directly address her busy schedule or the urgency of her tasks. - Go outdoors: This is too vague, as it does not specify a particular activity or event that would enable her to attend to her responsibilities. - Leave work: This action has a clear relationship to the context of the question. Leaving work would provide her with the necessary time to run errands and pick up the kids. - Field: This answer does not seem relevant to the question. Step 2: Identify the most logical answer based on the context of the situation. In this case, \\"leave work\\" is the most logical choice. As she is busy and has to attend to her responsibilities, it makes sense that she would be able to do so once she is done with her work.

Context: In the 11th century, Gascony in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine  and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony . The Angevin kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous. At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin  Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine. For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword. Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration. Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court. Question: Who was Eleanor of Aquitaine's husband? Answer:","output":"Eleanor of Aquitaine's husband was Henry II, who became the Angevin king of England after their marriage in 1152."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I found over 20 in the first 4 days of my 14 days of teaching myself QuarkXPress. I spent over a month (Daily 6 hrs a day) and still didn't learn QuarkXPress! The only reason I gave it 1 star is because you can't give it -5 stars. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. The title \\"GREAT! FOR LINING THE BIRD'S CAGE!!\\" is sarcastic, implying that the book is only useful as a lining for a bird's cage, rather than serving its intended educational purpose. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses numerous issues with the book and its accompanying CD. Firstly, the reviewer states that they would not recommend the book even to their worst enemy, which emphasizes their strong dissatisfaction with the product. They also mention substantial problems with the CD not working and numerous errors in the text, leading to a frustrating learning experience. The reviewer's inability to learn QuarkXPress despite investing a significant amount of time (over a month with 6 hours of daily practice) demonstrates the book's failure as a learning tool. Perhaps the most striking indication of the negative sentiment in the review is the final statement, where the reviewer wishes they could give it a score of -5 stars but reluctantly settles for a 1-star rating, as that is the lowest possible option. Overall, this product review clearly carries a negative sentiment. The reviewer encountered various issues with the product, leading to an unsuccessful and unsatisfactory learning experience, and therefore strongly advises against its purchase or use."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents. His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television. At the...  Guess a valid title for it!

Leonardo, nicknamed Leo, is a fictional character and one of the four main characters in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all related media. He is often depicted wearing a blue eye mask. His signature weapons are two katanas. Leonardo is the most serious, the most spiritual, the most disciplined, and the most in-line with Splinter's teachings and thoughts, and is the leader of the Turtles. In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Leonardo was fairly modest and sensitive, rarely issuing direct commands and seemingly much more relaxed around his brothers thinking of himself as more of an equal than a leader. It was he who first communicated telepathically with a kidnapped Splinter and seems the most anxious about Raphael's health after his ambush by the Foot Clan. He fought alongside his brothers against The Shredder in the climatic battle and was the only one of the four to actually injure The Shredder, but, like his brothers, could not defeat him. Due to the focus on Raphael in the film's plot, Leonardo's personality was rarely explored and his leader position in the team took a back seat. Leonardo was portrayed by David Forman and voiced by Brian Tochi.  In The Secret of the Ooze, Leonardo was much more prominent and his leader position was brought to focus. He is seen on many occasions bickering with Raphael as their sibling rivalry begins to become much more serious. He, like his brothers, was astonished at the return of the Foot but he found that their current homelessness due to their last battle was a more pressing issue and soon he convinced his brothers that they needed to move. Leonardo is once again sensitive, caring, and humorous in this adaption but he now appears much more bossy and controlling.  In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, after traveling back in time to feudal Japan, Leonardo leads his brothers to help a village in trouble from the villainous weapons trader, Walker, and to return home.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The SS Claridon is an old ship that is scheduled to be scrapped after just a few more voyages. Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter, Jill, are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship. Cliff runs back to their state room and can't get Laurie out alone. He then finds Jill trapped on the other side of the room. He tries to use a shattered piece of the bed to get to the other side, but it falls through the huge hole made by the explosion. Third Officer Osborne believes that the crew should start loading the passengers into the lifeboats, but Captain Robert Adams is reluctant, as he never lost a ship. Cliff rescues Jill by using a board to have her crawl across the hole on. Down in the boiler room, Second Engineer Walsh reports to Captain Adams that a seam to the bulkhead has broken away. Cliff tries to get  a steward's help, but to no avail. A passenger states that he overheard his conversation, and wants to help. Osborne reports that the boiler room is now half full. The ship then begins to transmit an SOS, on orders of Captain Adams. Cliff and a few other men return to his state room to try to help free Laurie, but find that they need a torch. The carpenter reports to the crew that the boiler room is now two thirds full. Captain Adams makes an announcement to the passengers to put on their life jackets. They then begin loading and launching the lifeboats.

This act of kindness and empathy demonstrates how dire situations often bring out the best in people, as strangers come together to help each other in times of crisis.

The initial statement describes a specific situation in which a woman is actively engaged in carrying a tray of food on her head while walking. This act requires concentration and balance, meaning the woman is awake and alert. The setting of the scene, which is in front of a church, does not provide any direct correlation to someone sleeping or being asleep. The description of her outfit, a white and blue tank, is equally unrelated to the concept of sleep. To arrive at the conclusion that \\"A woman is sleeping,\\" we would need additional information or context connecting the woman in the initial statement to the act of sleeping. However, since the given statement only presents information about the woman's actions, appearance, and location, we cannot derive any connection between the two statements or infer that the woman is sleeping at the same time.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, I would describe Cameron as resourceful. This is a detailed explanation of why I chose this answer: To begin, let's analyze the three options provided - angered, resourceful, and upset. Angered: This term suggests that someone is experiencing intense feelings of displeasure or animosity. In the given context, there is no mention of Cameron feeling angry or displaying any negative emotions. Thus, it is not fitting to describe Cameron as 'angered.' Upset: Similarly, being upset implies experiencing feelings of distress or unhappiness. The context doesn't provide any clues that Cameron might be unhappy or distressed after spending their friend's money. Therefore, 'upset' would not be an appropriate description. Resourceful: This term denotes someone who is good at finding ways to solve problems, often by using their own resources and creativity. In the given context, we know that Cameron received money from their friend and used it to purchase trinkets. Considering that there are no negative implications or emotions associated with this action, we can interpret this situation as Cameron using the resources available (the money received) to buy something they wanted or needed (the trinkets). In conclusion, based on the information provided, the best description for Cameron would be 'resourceful.' They successfully made use of the money given to them by choosing to spend it on trinkets, which indicates their ability to use available resources to fulfill their desires or needs. The other options, 'angered' and 'upset,' do not align with the context as they imply negative emotions or reactions that were not mentioned or implied.

Warehouse A forklift is a powered industrial truck designed to lift, carry, and stack heavy items, usually on pallets, crates, or containers. Forklifts are commonly used for stacking boxes onto shelves at various locations. Let's discuss each option in more detail to explain why the warehouse is the best answer. A. Loading Dock A loading dock is an area where trucks or other vehicles load and unload goods. Although forklifts can be used to move heavy items on pallets in and out of trucks, the primary purpose of this area is not specifically stacking boxes onto shelves. Forklifts perform a supporting role in loading docks. B. Construction Site A construction site is an area where buildings, structures, or infrastructure are being built. Forklifts can be used to move heavy materials and equipment around the site, but they are not primarily used for stacking boxes onto shelves at such locations. Construction sites have specialized equipment like cranes or telescopic handlers for lifting and moving construction materials. C. Supermarket Supermarkets are retail stores that sell a wide range of consumer goods, including food, beverages, and household items. While forklifts can be used to stock shelves with bulk items in supermarkets, they are not the primary method for doing so. Employees typically use hand trucks, pallet jacks, or manual stocking techniques in these settings. Additionally, forklifts can be hazardous in a busy retail environment where customers are present. D. Construction Yard A construction yard is an area where construction materials, tools, and vehicles are stored. Forklifts might be used to move materials around, but their use in stacking boxes onto shelves is limited in this setting. Construction yards house larger equipment and materials that require more specialized handling equipment. E. Warehouse A warehouse is a large storage facility where goods and materials are stored, often in pallets, crates, or containers, before being distributed to retail or wholesale customers. Warehouses require efficient and organized storage systems to manage inventory, and forklifts play a crucial role in lifting, carrying, and stacking boxes onto shelves or pallet racking systems. The spacious and well-organized environment of a warehouse, specifically designed for storing and managing inventory, makes it the most suitable place for using a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. In conclusion, the best answer is E, a warehouse, as they are specifically designed for managing inventory and optimizing storage space with the help of forklifts. Warehouses provide the appropriate environment for safe and efficient forklift operation for the purpose of stacking boxes onto shelves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nadal was often extended in cold and windy conditions but said he is running into his best form for the second week of the grand slam. \\"I am playing better now and today was a good test against Lleyton and to win against him in three sets is very good news,\\" he said in a courtside interview. The third set again followed the same pattern, with","output":"Nadal securing an early break and maintaining his momentum throughout. Hewitt, a two-time major champion and former world number one, showed his resilience and tenacity in trying to keep up with the powerful Spaniard. Nadal's forehand was in full swing, with the 11-time major champion using his trademark topspin to dominate the rallies and keep Hewitt on the back foot. Throughout the match, both players showcased their athleticism and exceptional shot-making abilities. While Nadal continued to assert his dominance, Hewitt frequently reminded the crowd of his remarkable talent, with some impressive winners and clever tactics. However, the Australian's serve ultimately let him down, as he struggled to find the right rhythm, allowing Nadal to capitalize on crucial points. Nadal's excellent clay court game was evident as he slid gracefully across the surface, making it difficult for Hewitt to find any openings in the Spaniard's near-perfect defensive strategy. As the match progressed, Nadal seemed more comfortable and confident, adapting quickly to the challenging weather conditions. Meanwhile, the 39-year-old Australian Hewitt displayed his trademark fighting spirit, refusing to back down and giving it everything he had. Despite showing glimpses of his former greatness, the match started to wear on him physically as he began to tire in the closing stages of the contest. Hewitt tried to break Nadal's serve early in the third set, but the Spaniard's heavy topspin and relentless pressure proved too much for the veteran. Nadal's consistency in key moments allowed him to maintain a comfortable lead, and eventually, he broke Hewitt's serve to take a commanding 5-3 lead in the final set. Serving for the match, Nadal displayed nerves of steel, calmly firing powerful first serves and accurate groundstrokes to set up a match point. And with one final forehand winner, the second seed secured a hard-fought 6-3 6-4 6-3 victory, advancing to the next round in his quest for a fifth French Open title. As Nadal and Hewitt embraced at the net, the crowd gave both players a standing ovation, acknowledging the amazing showdown they had just witnessed. Although Nadal ultimately emerged victorious, Hewitt earned the respect of the audience and his opponent for his extraordinary effort and unwavering determination. With this win, Nadal further solidified his position as the man to beat at Roland Garros. As he gears up for potentially even more challenging encounters in the second week of the tournament, Nadal knows that he must continue to improve and adapt to maintain his astonishing run on the red clay of Paris."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: How many seats are held in the 57 member assembly by the party that the Mantioba premier belongs to? , can you please find it?   After the control of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba attained full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province carved out of the Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The premier of Manitoba is Brian Pallister of the PC Party. The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats. The NDP holds 14 seats, and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature. The last provincial general election was held on 19 April 2016. The province is represented in federal politics by 14 Members of Parliament and six Senators.Manitoba's judiciary consists of the Court of...

Please answer a question about the following article about Affirmative action in the United States: Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve.

The northern portion of the state continued to decline economically which led to another revolt led by G. Casavantes in August 1879; Governor Trías was accused of misappropriation of funds and inefficient administration of the state. Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing Governor Trías to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Treviño; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Trías. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and water rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What always happens to someone after he or she finishes getting divorce?  Here are possible answers to this question: - no spouse - lot of grief - freedom - children suffer - party time  I believe the correct choice is \\"no spouse\\", here's why: A:","output":"After someone finishes getting a divorce, several things can happen, depending on the individual's circumstances and emotional state. However, the one constant that always holds true is that the person will no longer have a spouse. This is because a divorce legally dissolves a marriage, thereby ending the contract with their spouse, leaving them single again. This \\"no spouse\\" state will have different implications for different people. It can be seen as a negative consequence for some individuals who might be experiencing a lot of grief. Divorce can be a very painful and challenging experience, especially for those who have been in long-term relationships or had a strong emotional connection with their spouse. This grief can manifest in different ways – feelings of loneliness, sadness, guilt, and fear of the future – and may take considerable time and effort to work through. On the other hand, others might feel a sense of freedom after getting a divorce. For those who have experienced an unhappy marriage or felt trapped in a toxic relationship, finalizing a divorce can be an opportunity for a fresh start. It brings the chance to rediscover oneself, pursue new interests, and create a new, healthier life without the constraints of an unhappy marriage. That said, the impact of a divorce on children should not be overlooked. Divorce can be particularly difficult for children as they struggle to adapt to new living arrangements, emotional turmoil, and possible conflicts between their parents. The well-being of children might suffer as they attempt to navigate this complicated and painful change in their lives. It is essential for parents to work together to minimize the negative effects of divorce on their children, maintain open communication, and prioritize their needs. For some people, the end of a marriage might be seen as a reason to celebrate, hence the notion of \\"party time.\\" This perception largely depends on the circumstances surrounding a particular divorce and the individuals involved. For those who might have felt oppressed in their marriage, they might view their newfound single status as a cause for a celebration or a time to reconnect with friends and indulge in activities they may have withdrawn from during the marriage. In conclusion, the correct choice \\"no spouse\\" captures the most certain outcome following a divorce: the person will no longer be legally bound in a marriage contract. However, it is important to remember that this event can have several consequences, both positive and negative, depending on the individuals involved. Some people might experience grief or freedom, while others might even see it as a cause for celebration. In any case, being aware of the potential challenges and emotions that follow a divorce and considering the well-being of everyone involved, particularly children, is crucial for moving forward in a healthy and productive manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm a senior program director. If I didn't bike to work, I'd spend my weekdays almost entirely indoors--underground tunnel. On the bike, I get trees, air and a great way to get to know city neighborhoods. Of course, I also get bad weather and city traffic. But it's worth the trade-off. The weather's not often bad, and rain and snow have their charms. I've been cycling to work since the late 1990s. I started when the city was doing some construction in the subways and rerouting passengers, which would have lengthened my trip considerably. I tried riding my sister- in- law's bike to work one day and liked it, so I bought my own. Even though I hadn't biked since I was a child, I got back into it right away. I bike during all four seasons. In summer, I wear shorts and a T- shirt and carry a messenger bag over my shoulder for my lunch and anything else I need. Once at the office, I change into business- casual clothes. In winter, I wear layers and a thin hat under my helmet. A cold winter day can be the best time to be on a bicycle. When the air is clear, free of oppressive summer haze, the city can look beautiful. Biking to work also _ during the workday itself. I have a rack   on the back of my bike that accommodates panniers that allow me to pick up groceries. During work hours, a colleague will occasionally need to send or retrieve documents by messenger. If I have the time, I volunteer. Pedaling 30 blocks and back is a nice way to take a break from work--and to save the office a few bucks on messenger fees. I'm sure that some people thinking my mode of transportation might be afraid of Midtown traffic. I'm no hero; I don't want to get hurt riding to work. It just takes time getting used to it. There's a risk, but all travel has risks. They're worth it to me. What made the author began to ride a bike to work? A) The author bought his own bike. B) His sister- in- law lent him a bike.

Movie title: Midnight Express Context: This movie is based loosely on Billy Hayes' book Midnight Express about his five year experience in the Turkish prison system. The movie was exaggerated for dramatic effect.October 6, 1970. Opening scene has a xenophobic soundtrack of machine guns, Muslim prayer cries, and synthesizer music and a glimpse of Istanbul, Turkey during twilight with shots of the Bosphorus Strait, a mosque, and the downtown area with seagulls flying about . It is portrayed as a very spooky, forbidding place.While finishing up on his vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is in his hotel room and straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body. The film's soundtrack consists of an increasing heartbeat.Billy is at the airport, nervous at being caught smuggling, goes to the washroom to wet his face and attempt to relax himself, and makes his way with his girlfriend, Susan (Irene Miracle), through customs. Billy perspires heavily, noticed by the middle aged, chain-smoking customs agent who checks his bag. After his bags are searched, both Billy and Susan board a shuttle bus to their plane. Billy smiles and is relieved thinking he is out of danger. However, as the bus pulls up to the plane, he notices that a large detachment of armed police and soldiers have taken up positions just outside the plane. Unable to detach and discard the hashish, and sweating heavily, Billy is arrested on the spot when he is frisked by a young Turkish policeman. Billy is taken away and back to security and searched, his bags being thoroughly searched and all items such as cigarettes, camera film, and toothpaste are searched and destroyed. He is forced to stand around in his underwear. Afterwards, the Turkish security chief of the airport makes his stand for several press photographs of him holding the confiscated drugs with the smiling customs officers and then slaps them around after Billy reveals more hashish in his boots they didn't find.A little later, Billy is forced to stand naked with the...

Mr Cooke and six co-defendants, are on trial and deny a range of sex offences against boys aged 10 to 15. The court heard boys were plied with drink and drugs before being assaulted. Prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said the case centred on the home of Mr Cooke and, apart from Keith Stokes, all the defendants had some sort of connection to him. \\"This case is concerned with the activities of a predatory paedophile ring,\\" she told the jury. \\"The boys were young, vulnerable, sometimes isolated by family circumstances and manipulated by Gary Cooke and others.\\" The court heard the boys were groomed by being offered treats such as cinema trips and given attention, which all led to \\"grave sexual abuse\\". One of the defendants who visited Mr Cooke's addresses was teacher and care home owner Roger Griffiths, a convicted paedophile, the court was told. The jury heard Mr Griffiths owned Gatewen Hall children's home in Wrexham from 1977 to 1983 and was a teacher at Wrexham Special Education Centre, which has since closed down.

Q: Q: Metabolic cooperation between different prokaryotic species often occurs in surface-coating colonies. what are these colonies called?   A:  -- eukaryotes; -- lichens; -- plankton; -- biofilms; The answer is:","output":"Biofilms. Metabolic cooperation between different prokaryotic species often occurs in surface-coating colonies called biofilms. Biofilms are complex and dynamic communities of microorganisms, primarily bacteria and archaea, which adhere to a surface and are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. The EPS is a mixture of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that not only provide structural support for the biofilm but also play essential roles in nutrient capture, stress tolerance, and intercellular communication. In a biofilm, different species of prokaryotes can coexist and collaborate to optimize their metabolic activities and overall survival. This cooperation allows the organisms to carry out various functions and adapt to environmental changes more effectively than single, isolated cells. Some of the advantages of living in a biofilm include enhanced resistance to antimicrobial agents, easier access to nutrients, and protection from environmental stresses like desiccation, predation, and abrasion. Different metabolic pathways can overlap and complement each other within a biofilm, enabling the community to use various energy sources more efficiently. For example, syntrophic interactions (where one species benefits from the metabolic byproducts of another) can occur, allowing biofilm inhabitants to maximize nutrient utilization and recycle waste products. One well-known example of such cooperation is in the case of anaerobic digestion, where the coordinated action of several species of bacteria and archaea helps break down complex organic molecules and produce methane. The development and maintenance of a biofilm rely not only on interactions between different prokaryotic species but also involve complex signaling pathways and regulatory systems. These include quorum sensing, which helps coordinate gene expression and behavior based on cell density, and the production of small molecules (e.g., autoinducers) that allow cells to communicate and cooperate. Biofilms can be found in various natural, industrial, and medical settings, making them subjects of great interest to researchers. They can play a role in bioremediation (by degrading environmental pollutants), the food industry (as agents of fermentation), and medicine (as sources of antibiotic resistance). At the same time, biofilms can also be sources of contamination and infection, posing challenges in areas like public health and industrial hygiene. In summary, biofilms are surface-coating colonies of prokaryotes in which metabolic cooperation occurs, resulting in a wide range of ecological roles, both beneficial and harmful. The interactions and communication between species within a biofilm allow them to adapt to environmental changes and perform various functions more effectively than individual cells, making them essential players in many ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Our correspondent says that, after her appearance, numerous bloggers and social media entries have published her supposed name. Beryl Aidi, from the Kenyan Human Rights Commission, says this may deter further witnesses from testifying. \\"Now that a witness has been identified it will be difficult to assure others that they and their family members will be safe.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few...

News article: Japan to resume 'research' whaling in Antarctic, move to conflict with ruling by International Court of Justice      Updated      Japan has decided to resume whaling in the Antarctic Ocean by the end of March after a hiatus since last year, a move likely to prompt international outrage.      The International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year ruled that Japan's decades-old whale hunt in the Antarctic should stop, prompting Tokyo to cancel the bulk of its whaling in the 2014-2015 season.      But the Japanese Fisheries Agency has now notified the International Whaling Commission (IWC) that it will resume whaling in the 2015-2016 season under a revised plan.      The plan, which calls for cutting annual minke whale catches by two-thirds to 333, is \\"scientifically reasonable\\", the agency said in a document filed with the IWC.      Japanese media said whalers were expected to depart for the ocean possibly by the end of December.      There was no immediate comment from the IWC or the ICJ.      Environment Minister Greg Hunt said Japan had previously said it would abide by the ruling, and added that there is no need to kill whales in the name of research.      Japan began what it calls scientific whaling in 1987, a year after an international whaling moratorium took effect.      It hunts the whales under an exemption in the moratorium that allows for lethal research.      Japan makes no secret of the fact that meat from the mammals - killed ostensibly for research - is processed into food, and says the whale population in any case is big enough to allow sustainable whaling.      It accuses opponents of being emotional about whales and disregarding what it says is evidence to support its position.      Japan killed 251 minke whales in the Antarctic in the 2013-14 season and 103 the previous year, far below its target because of direct action by activist group Sea Shepherd.      Reuters/AFP      Topics: environment, conservation, whaling, mammals---whales, japan      First posted ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan says it will catch only a third of the minke whales it caught under its previous programme - 333 instead of 1,000      Japan has announced it will resume whaling in the Antarctic early next year after a break of more than a year.      The decision comes despite an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that Japan cease all whaling.      The Japanese government says it has taken into account the court ruling and its \\"scientific\\" whaling programme will be much smaller.      But the announcement has been condemned by environmental groups and the Australian and UK governments.      \\"We do not accept in any way, shape or form the concept of killing whales for so-called 'scientific research',\\" said Australian Environment Minister Greg Hunt.      \\"We are deeply disappointed with Japan's decision to restart whaling in the Southern Ocean,\\" said the UK environment ministry, Defra. \\"This undermines the global ban on commercial whaling which the UK strongly supports.\\"      Image copyright Twitter      A guide to the great whales      Japan's whaling fleet could set sail again within weeks and head for the Southern Ocean, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Tokyo.      Under Japan's revised plan, it will reduce the number of minke whales caught each year by two thirds to 333.      The Japanese authorities believe their plan is scientifically reasonable but it is unlikely to placate opponents, in particular the Australian government.      \\"Japan cannot unilaterally decide whether it has adequately addressed\\" scientists' questions, Mr Hunt was quoted as saying.      Image copyright AFP Image caption This is the latest move in a years-long struggle pitting Japan against other governments, activists and the international court      Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan makes no secret of the fact that the meat resulting from its so-called scientific whaling programme ends up on the plate      'Sentimental' critics      In 2014 Australia won a case against Japan in the international court of justice in the Netherlands.      The court ruled that Japan's \\"scientific\\" whaling program was not scientific at all - and ordered Tokyo to recall its fleet.      Crucially, the ruling stated that it did not believe it was necessary for Japan to kill whales in order to study them, our correspondent says.      Japan started its whaling programme in 1987, a year after an international moratorium was enacted.      It accuses critics of being sentimental about whales and disregarding scientific evidence about the sustainability of whaling.      The ICJ says Japan has caught some 3,600 minke whales since its current programme began in 2005. ||||| Japan should toe the line and hold off on resuming whaling in the Antarctic until the International Whaling Commission looks at it, New Zealand says.      Japan wants to resume whaling in the Antarctic Ocean by the end of March.      Tokyo cancelled the bulk of its whaling for the 2014-15 season following a ruling from the International Court of Justice.      But the Japanese Fisheries Agency has notified the International Whaling Commission that Japan will resume whaling in the 2015-16 season under a revised plan.      The plan, which calls for cutting annual minke whale catches by two-thirds to 333, is scientifically reasonable, the agency said in a document filed with the commission.      New Zealand's Acting Foreign Minister Todd McClay says the decision is disappointing and Japan should heed the court's decision and international scientific evidence.      The whaling commission's expert panel was very clear this year that Japan had not made the case for lethal research, Mr McClay said.      \\"New Zealand's long-standing and fundamental opposition to this practice remains unchanged,\\" Mr McClay said.      \\"It is clear that Japan's research objectives can be met using non-lethal means.      \\"We call on Japan to heed the expert panel's advice and postpone any whaling this season. Our strong view is that Japan should at least afford the International Whaling Commission the opportunity to consider the proposal in 2016.\\"      Japan began what it calls scientific whaling in 1987, a year after an international whaling moratorium took effect.      Japan has long maintained that most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its food culture.      Last year, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe during his visit to Auckland that Kiwis want to see the end of whaling.      Mr Key at the time would not rule out getting the Navy involved if Japan breaches the court's ruling.

She is the only child of Wilbur Rimes and Belinda Butler. The family moved to Garland, Texas when she was six. She was enrolled in vocal and dance classes, and was performing at local talent shows at the age of 5. In January 2005, Rimes released her seventh studio album, This Woman, her first album of contemporary country music in many years. Although the album received mixed reviews from magazines and critics, it was Rimes's best-selling album in over five years, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in 2005, selling more than 100,000 copies within its first week. Rimes explained to the Chicago Sun-Times that the album helped mature her as a person, \\"I have 10 years of experience, so it's tough to get anything past me in this business. I've become a very strong woman because of all I've gone through, good and bad.\\" This Woman would eventually be certified \\"Gold\\" later in 2005, after selling more than 500,000 units nationwide. The album's singles were Rimes's first Top 10 hits on the Hot Country Songs chart in five years. The three singles released from the album--\\"Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense\\", \\"Probably Wouldn't Be This Way\\", and \\"Something's Gotta Give\\"--all peaked within the Top 5 on the country charts between 2005 and 2006. From the album, Rimes was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". In addition, she was also nominated for an American Music Award for \\"Favorite Female Country Artist.\\" In 2006, Rimes recorded a cover version of Barbara Mandrell's \\"If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)\\", for a tribute album to Mandrell's career titled, She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool: A Tribute to Barbara Mandrell. Rimes also would record a track for Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration album titled, \\"Remember When.\\"  In summer 2006, Rimes released the studio album Whatever We Wanna, which was released exclusively outside of the United States and Canada. It was originally planned on being released in North America, however due to the success of This Woman, it was never released. The album spawned three singles, \\"And It Feels Like\\", a duet with Brian McFadden titled, \\"Everybody's Someone\\" and \\"Strong\\". The album leaned more towards Pop Rock and R&B music instead of country.  Rimes would release one final single in the US from her album This Woman in August 2006 called \\"Some People\\" which would peak at 34 on the US country charts.

Solve 546*n = 561*n + 150 for n.","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like we're explaining it to a five-year-old. We have this problem: 546 * n = 561 * n + 150 First, we need to get all the n's on one side of the equal sign. So, let's subtract 546 * n from both sides: 546 * n - 546 * n = 561 * n - 546 * n + 150 That simplifies to: 0 = 15 * n + 150 Now, we want to get rid of the 150 on the right side, so we'll subtract 150 from both sides: 0 - 150 = 15 * n + 150 - 150 Which simplifies to: -150 = 15 * n Now, we want to find out what n is. We'll do that by dividing both sides by 15: -150 / 15 = 15 * n / 15 That simplifies to: -10 = n So, the solution to the math problem is n = -10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. Soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. Shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas... Produced & directed by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst, I mean I'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that's worse. Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb (the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film I have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & I have to agree with them. The story is terrible, alright I suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? There's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. It goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. Oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. Then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion. On a technical level again I can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen. As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & I definitely don't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk. It really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & I hated every moment of every second of it. Just think The Blair Witch Project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end. Low budget doesn't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes, with a supposed budget of about 4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. The acting is pretty bad by the main cast, I just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely. Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen & I have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention. I hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is decidedly negative.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Where did the construction of NOVAC take place? Washington D.C. A:","output":"Title: Rise of NOVAC Genre: Drama/Thriller Plot: In a not-so-distant future, Washington D.C. is facing rapid technological advancements, and the urban landscape is changing at an unprecedented pace. Amidst the soaring skyscrapers and powerful political players, a top-secret project begins to take shape. A mysterious private corporation known as NOVAC has been awarded a lucrative construction contract by the government to build a monumental structure that is said to change the face of the city forever.  The movie begins by introducing the main character, Jack, a talented young architect fresh out of college, who receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work on the project alongside some of the world's most renowned professionals. As he navigates the complicated world of high-stakes construction and political intrigue, Jack befriends an investigative journalist named Rachel, who is also interested in discovering the truth about the purpose of NOVAC. As they dig deeper, they uncover that NOVAC's construction is not merely a visually stunning architectural masterpiece but serves a much darker purpose. The government, in association with NOVAC, plans to use the building as a stronghold for power and control over the people. Jack and Rachel endeavor to expose the truth, even at the cost of their own safety and careers. As construction of NOVAC progresses, they gradually discover that the building is equipped with advanced surveillance technology and security measures beyond anything ever seen in history. The structure would essentially act as a nexus for government control and a deterrent against any form of rebellion in the city and the nation. Throughout the movie, Jack and Rachel gather evidence and forge alliances with other concerned citizens and whistle-blowers within the organization. Meanwhile, the construction of NOVAC continues at a relentless pace, with the city's population growing more and more anxious about what lies ahead. The climax of the film sees Jack and Rachel sabotaging the NOVAC project by revealing its true purpose on live television, sparking a massive protest outside the building's gates. The government is forced to rethink its plan, and as a result, the construction is halted. Jack and Rachel face enormous backlash but become heroes in the eyes of the public. In the end, the duo inspire a resurgence of hope and activism in the city, proving that even in a world increasingly governed by technology and power, the will of the people can still make a difference. The film concludes with a lasting reminder that the fight for truth, justice, and freedom never ends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A few growers place charcoal in the bottom of containers to absorb excess salts and maintain sweet soil, if plants are grown more than a few months. Can we draw the following conclusion? The charcoal is not very cheap","output":"Based on the given information, it's not possible to draw the conclusion that charcoal is expensive or not very cheap. The data you've provided explains different uses and benefits of charcoal in gardening, mainly its ability to absorb excess salts and maintain sweet soil. This is especially necessary for plants that are grown over a prolonged period of months. Charcoal is known to be helpful in improving the soil structure and enhancing its ability to retain both nutrients and moisture. Using charcoal is a way to maintain a suitable environment for plants, especially during extended growth periods. This absorption capacity can reduce the risk of salt build-up that may harm the plants.  But none of this information can directly lead us to conclude anything precise about the cost of charcoal. The price of charcoal could be influenced by many factors including the type of charcoal used (activated charcoal is typically more expensive than regular charcoal), the region where it's purchased (some areas may have higher prices due to import costs or lack of local supply), and the quantity purchased (buying in bulk could reduce the cost per unit).    Therefore, to argue the cost of charcoal, we would need additional information on current market prices, the specific type of charcoal being used, quantity needed for cultivation, and the local availability of charcoal to the growers. If the growers continue using it despite an alternative, that could imply the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of charcoal as compared to potential substitutes, but without explicit information, it is speculative. In short, while it's clear that charcoal has valuable applications for growers, the original statement does not provide enough information for us to draw a definitive conclusion about the cost of charcoal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Democrats probably used the comment to justify Trump's words; (IV). not enough information; Q: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors.

Article: Why are you study habits different from those of your friends? Why do you seem to learn faster in some classes while more slowly in others? One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic  .  Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it.

My husband and I are fairly recent transplants to the Valley and I'd been given a recommendation to check this place out for sushi.  I'll start out by saying that the service was good and the sashimi that we order was fresh.  After that it pretty much goes down hill.  We spent 80 just on sushi, and both of us left there hungry.  Steep prices are met by skimpy amounts of fish.  The only normal sized item we were served was the salmon sashimi.  One of our appetizers was yellowtail, and for 18 we were served 6 tiny slivers of tuna.  The rolls, while I particularly enjoyed that they were the perfect bite sized amounts and looked pretty when it was served, primarily consisted of rice.  Sorry, but a mouthful of rice is not what I'm looking for when spending 15+ on a roll.  I'd actually like to have SOME fish in the roll.  Everything but the sashimi pretty much lacked flavor and character.  They touted when we got there that it was authentic Japanese, well, I hate to tell them it is far from it!  Just because you have a very limited selection on your menu doesn't mean it is authentic Japanese.  I've had sushi in Japan... and the Japanese would scoff at what was presented to us.    If you want to pay for a \\"yuppy\\" Scottsdale vibe, then this is your place.  But if you actually want fish with your sushi and to be fulfilled when you're done eating...

Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer.

The farmhouse is occupied by Lieutenant Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), his obese wife (Viktória Kiss), and their two teenage daughters. Morosgoványi lives in a crude shed with pigs and spends much time having sexual fantasies about the young girls, typically while spying on them, masturbating or experimenting with his remarkable ability to shoot flames out of the end of his penis.Following the slaughter of one of the hogs, Morosgoványi is propositioned by Mrs. Balatony who pulls Morosgoványi down upon her in the wooden bathtub containing the pig carcass. They have vigorous and loud sex, with Morosgoványi fantasizing that he's actually screwing the Balatony daughters. Upon finishing, Morosgoványi falls asleep and it is apparent that he was fantasizing the entire encounter while actually copulating with the dead pig.The next morning, Lt. Balatony kicks open the door to the shed, and shoots the slowly awakening Morosgoványi in the back of the head, blowing his brains out. Mrs Balatony subsequently gives birth to a very large, fat baby. The lieutenant examines the boy lying in the wooden bathtub and discovers a pig-like tail on him.

Summarize: He and a co-defendant were convicted of breaking into computers owned by technology services giant CSC by a Danish court. They downloaded police and social security files from the computers. Prosecutors said it was the \\"largest hacking case to date\\". Soon after the sentence was announced, lawyers representing Mr Warg said they would launch an appeal. Warg's accomplice was given a six-month jail sentence but walked free from the court, having served 17 months in pre-trial detention. The initial hack attack took place in February 2012 and gave the pair access to the sensitive information, including social security numbers and police records, for about six months. Defence lawyers said that, although the hack attacks were carried out using a computer owned by Warg, he was not the person that used it to steal the files. Instead, they said, an unnamed hacker took over this machine and used it to carry out the attacks. Warg has declined to name this other hacker. After considering evidence, the judge and jury in the case said it was \\"unlikely\\" that other people were responsible. The court's decision is the third to go against Warg in the last five years. He was deported from Cambodia in September 2013 to Sweden where he served a jail term for copyright theft because of his involvement with the Pirate Bay file-sharing site. In a separate trial in 2013, Warg was sentenced to two years in a Swedish jail for hacking into a bank's computers. This sentence was reduced to one year on appeal. In that trial, Warg and accomplice were found guilty of breaking into the computer systems of computer services firm Logica, which was doing work for Sweden's tax office and a bank. On that occasion his accomplice was put on probation. In late November 2013 he was deported to Denmark to face charges in the CSC hacking cases.","output":"A Danish court convicted two individuals, including Pirate Bay co-founder Mr. Warg, of hacking into technology service giant CSC's computers and downloading sensitive information like social security numbers and police records.

Grandaddy is an American indie rock band from Modesto, California. The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\".  Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\"  There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".

Two other people were wounded and were in critical condition, Robinson said.      The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. Police don't have a motive, but Robinson said it was not a random act.      Kat Raco, an ophthalmic technician who works on the second floor of the Nevada Advanced Medicine building, told CNN that she heard at least two large booms and then the sound of scampering feet above her.      The shooter opened fire after going to the urology office of Nevada Advanced Medicine on the third floor, said Sharon Spangler, spokeswoman for Reno Police.      Raco said she and others in her office were seeing patients when the shooting occurred and first thought someone or something had fallen.      Police were there quickly, she said, telling them to lock the doors and not let anyone in.      About 10 minutes after that, more police escorted everyone on the second floor to a catwalk between the building and a parking garage. A plain-clothed officer asked questions before staff was allowed to leave about 45 minutes after the shooting.      JUST WATCHED Police: 2 dead, 2 hurt in Reno shooting Replay More Videos ...

Earlier, the University of Nevada police tweeted that there was an active shooter and faculty, staff and students should find shelter where they were.      CNN first learned of the shooting through the university police department's Twitter account.      The medical center describes itself as the only Level II trauma center in that region of Nevada and is home to the area's only Children's Hospital, its website says. The facility also offers the region's largest number of clinical research trials.      Last month, there was a hospital shooting in Wisconsin when police shot and wounded an armed man on the neonatal intensive care floor of a Milwaukee-area children's hospital, authorities said.      Milwaukee police had gone to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to arrest the man on a felony warrant and found him holding a child in the intensive care unit, authorities said. Instead of surrendering, the man took out a handgun and fled down a hallway, prompting police to shoot him. ||||| A lone gunman shot and injured four people before killing himself at a hospital building in Reno, Nev.

The diameter   of Venus is about 7,520 miles (12,100km), about 400 miles (644km) smaller than that of the earth. No other planet comes closer to the earth than Venus. At its nearest approach it is about 25,000,000 miles (402,000,000km) away. As seen from the earth, Venus is the first planet or star that can be seen in the western sky in the evening. At other times, it is the last planet or star that can be seen in the eastern sky in the morning. When Venus is near its brightest point, it can be seen in the daylight. Early astronomers called the object that appeared in the evening Hesperus, and Phosphorus in the morning. Later they realized these two objects were the same planet. They named it Venus in honor of the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Question: Venus is called the earth's \\"twin\\" because   _  .

Information:  - The quest for the historical Jesus refers to academic efforts to provide a historical portrait of Jesus. Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions.  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.  - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars.  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - John the Apostle ( Aramaic :    Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew :     Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek :  ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament .  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.    What is the relationship between 'john the apostle' and 'historical jesus'? The answer to this question is:","output":"John the Apostle was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. He was a close disciple and follower of Jesus during his ministry. As one of the key figures in early Christianity, John the Apostle had a personal relationship with Jesus, and he was an eyewitness to many events in Jesus' life. The Gospel of John, traditionally attributed to John the Apostle, contains accounts of Jesus' life, teachings, and miracles, providing significant information about the historical Jesus. However, modern scholars have debated the authorship of the Gospel of John and whether it can be directly attributed to John the Apostle. In summary, John the Apostle was a close follower of Jesus and potentially contributed a crucial source for our understanding of the historical Jesus, although the precise nature of the relationship between John's Gospel and the historical Jesus continues to be a subject of scholarly debate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write an article based on this summary: Saudi Arabia is responding to the recent Russian air strikes on Syrian rebels by stepping up its supplies of lethal weaponry to three different rebel groups, a Saudi government official has told the BBC.","output":"Title: Saudi Arabia Increases Weapon Supply to Syrian Rebels in Response to Russian Air Strikes Introduction: In light of recent Russian air strikes on Syrian rebels, a Saudi government official has informed the BBC that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is stepping up its supplies of lethal weaponry to three different rebel groups. This move, a direct response to Russian aggression, demonstrates the escalating tensions and involvement of global powers in the Syrian conflict. Step 1: Provide background on the Syrian conflict The Syrian civil war, ongoing since 2011, has claimed countless lives and created a global refugee crisis. The multi-faceted conflict has seen both regional and global actors taking sides, with Russia and Iran supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and countries such as the United States, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia backing various rebel factions. Step 2: Detail the Russian air strikes In recent weeks, Russia has launched air strikes targeting Syrian rebels, resulting in civilian casualties and drawing criticism from Western countries. Russian officials maintain that their actions are aimed at combatting terrorism and stabilizing the region, but critics argue that Russia's true intent is to prop up the Assad regime. Step 3: Explain Saudi Arabia's role in the conflict Saudi Arabia has been a key supporter of the Syrian opposition battling Assad's forces. They have long supplied arms and financial assistance to various rebel groups, seeing Assad's downfall as instrumental in countering Iranian influence in the region. Step 4: Describe the increase in weapon supplies and the motivation behind it In response to the Russian air strikes, a Saudi government official revealed to the BBC that the nation has increased its supply of lethal weaponry to three different rebel factions. This move is intended to directly counter Russian aggression and support the opposition in their fight against Assad's forces. Step 5: Discuss the potential consequences of Saudi Arabia's actions Increased weapon supplies to Syrian rebels could lead to further escalation of the conflict, as well as heightened tensions between global powers involved in the region. This move may trigger further intervention by other countries, potentially leading to a widening of the proxy war and increased instability in an already volatile region. Conclusion: As the Syrian conflict continues to evolve, the reported increase in weapon supplies by Saudi Arabia to rebel groups indicates a deepening involvement in the war. With each new development, the ongoing struggle in Syria becomes more complex, and the need for a resolution becomes even more urgent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Parthenogenesis - This is a type of asexual reproduction where an offspring develops from an unfertilized egg. This process does not describe the transformation of a larva into an adult. 2. Synthesis - This term refers to the process of combining components or elements to form a new substance or entity. It does not describe the transformation of a larva into an adult. 3. Evolution - This term refers to the change in species' inherited traits over generations, leading to the development of new species. While it relates to biology, it does not specifically describe the change a larva undergoes to become an adult. 4. Metamorphosis - This is the biological process of a larva transforming into a more mature form, typically through various stages (such as a pupa) until it reaches its adult form.

Let's analyze the options provided in detail: 1. Yes: We cannot choose 'yes' as the correct option because the initial statement does not state any specific details about the activities of the kids in the park. There is no direct mention of how many kids are playing what or if they are playing at all. 2. It is not possible to tell: This option is the most accurate answer. From the given statement, all we know is that there is a group of kids in the park. The statement does not provide any information about what they are doing or the number of kids involved in a particular activity. We cannot make any conclusive assumptions about kids playing drums or any other specific activity. Therefore, it is not possible to tell if two kids are playing the drums. 3. No: Choosing 'no' would imply that there are definitely no kids playing drums, which is not something we can conclude from the given statement. Again, the statement only informs us about the presence of kids in the park, not about their specific activities.

It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi).  - Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \\"bushranger\\" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These \\"Wild Colonial Boys\\", mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes typically included robbing small-town banks and coach services. In other infamous cases, such as that of Dan Morgan, the Clarke brothers, and Australia's best-known bushranger, Ned Kelly, numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. Kelly's capture and execution in 1880 effectively represented the end of the bushranging era.  - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancients invented and used themselves for thousands of years. Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially in handling emergency situations. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills.  - A gold rush is a new discovery of gold that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune. Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United States, while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere.  - Telegraphy (from Greek:  \\"têle\\", \\"at a distance\\" and  \\"gráphein\\", \\"to write\\") is the long-distance transmission of textual or symbolic (as opposed to verbal or audio) messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message.

It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands.

After being convicted under the alias Francis Melville , McCallum was transported to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) as a convict in 1838 , aged 15 , and left for Melbourne about October 1851 . During 1852 as Captain Melville he was alleged to have led a large band of bushrangers on the roads in the Black Forest between Melbourne and Ballarat , and gained a folkloric reputation through the boldness of his outrages and the chivalry he showed to many , especially women . His name was associated with the Nelson robbery and St Kilda Road robberies , probably without foundation as in reality he seems to have spent most of his time bailing up diggers around Mount Macedon , either on his own or with one or two mates . On Christmas Eve 1852 , when under the alias of Thomas Smith , he and fellow bushranger William Robert Roberts were arrested at a brothel in Corio Street , Geelong , and eventually faced Judge Redmond Barry at the Geelong Circuit Court on 3 February 1853 on three counts of robbery . Barry sentenced both men to twelve , ten and ten years on each count , respectively -- in Melville 's case to be served consecutively . Although employed in chains on the roads of Victoria by the time of the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery of 20 July 1853 , Captain Melville 's name has become associated with it over the years because of the coincidence of one of the Escort robbers , George Melville , using the same surname as his alias . In 1854 he was one of a party of prisoners based on the prison hulk Success in Port Phillip Bay who attempted to seize and escape in a boat , during which a warder was killed . Sentenced to death but reprieved , he was then sent to Old Melbourne Gaol , where he was found hanged in his cell on 10 August 1857 .  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The Victorian gold rush was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s.  - Brothers Thomas (c. 1840  25 June 1867) and John Clarke (c. 1846  25 June 1867) were Australian bushrangers from the Braidwood district of New South Wales. They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the \\"Felons' Apprehension Act (1866)\\", a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemenfour of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all. They were captured during a shoot-out in April 1867 and hanged two months later at Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol. Their execution ended organised gang bushranging in New South Wales.  - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia.

Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\".  - Frank Gardiner (1830  c. 1903?) was an Australian bushranger. Sources differ as to his origins. Some have him as a Currency Lad, native-born near Goulburn, New South Wales around 1830, others that he was Scottish-born, and migrated to Australia as a child with his parents in 1834. His real name was Francis Christie, though he often used one of several other aliases including Gardiner, Clarke or Christie. He supposedly took the name Gardiner after a man who lived for some years with his family and who had taught him how to ride and break in horses. He continued to use the surname Gardiner when he moved to the United States.    What entity does 'frank mccallum' has the relation 'given name' with?

Eric Greenberg said he thought wines he sold, which made about 42m in eight years of auctions, were authentic. The lawsuit alleged Bordeaux wine had been labelled to suggest it was bottled between 1864 and 1950. Two dozen bottles of the fake wine were fraudulently sold to him at an auction in 2005, Mr Koch alleged. \\"Out of sight! Over the moon!\\" said Mr Koch said, laughing, outside a court in New York. \\"We weren't even expecting any damages and we got 12 million. Unbelievable!\\" As he left the court with his lawyer, each of them displayed one of the bottles at stake in the trial. Mr Koch, an energy magnate and brother of major US industrialists David and Charles Koch, also said he would use the settlement to help eliminate fraud in the wine auction market and would create a website to help spot fake wines and their dealers. But Mr Greenberg, a businessman from California, said the outcome of the trial was \\"a disappointment because I believed all the consigned wine to be authentic,\\" in a statement. \\"We believe that we acted honourably and tried to do the right thing for all concerned,\\" he added, saying he would appeal against the verdict. In an earlier statement to the jury, Mr Greenberg suggested the case had cost the two parties a total of 17m. \\"I'm very sorry I had counterfeit wine. It's a horrible thing. Both of us have lost millions of dollars.\\" After the ruling, one juror described how they decided how much should be paid to Mr Koch in damages.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A Viking boy called Hiccup (voice: Jay Baruchel) introduces his village of Berk (\\"it's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new\\"). The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off. Despite being told by every adult in sight to go indoors, Hiccup hauls out a bolas-shooting cannon he made himself and shoots a dragon out of the night sky. (As assistant to the village blacksmith, Gobber (voice: Craig Ferguson), Hiccup has access to tools and materials and knows how to use them.) The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it's the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can't make himself kill it.

While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it's missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather. The new fin helps, but Toothless can't control it and inadvertently takes Hiccup for a ride, giving him a clear idea of what's needed to help the dragon fly right. In a series of workshop and test flight scenes, Hiccup builds and perfects a saddle, a control mechanism for the tail fin, and a safety harness.Meanwhile, Hiccup's father Stoick (voice: Gerard Butler) has signed him up for dragon training with Gobber, which is very different from the training he's already doing with Toothless: he's going to learn to fight dragons.

Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past. What did Hume think is a circular argument?","output":"Hume thought that the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.

Coyote, (Eatibus Anythingus), trudges across the floor of the desert, catching anything that he can find, from a fly to an empty tin can, with the intention of eating it. Suddenly, he is flattened by the Road Runner, (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile recovers, blinks his eyes, and has a vision of a wonderful Road Runner feast. He then ditches the tin can and chases after the Road Runner, adopting a low stance to reduce his drag which allows him to close in on the Road Runner, but the bird finds another gear and rockets away, leaving the coyote's eyes to pop out of his sockets. Dejected, he plans his next scheme.Wile sets up a pulley, rope and rock trap to try smashing the passing Road Runner, hoping its extra complexity will stop Wile from being squashed, but the rock finds a way to squash the coyote as the Road Runner stops to mock him.A furious Wile arms himself with a lasso as he waits for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso before the bird can get there, and drags Wile across the hard ground.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. A proposed health-care compromise by the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee lacks a government-run insurance option favored by Democrats and would tax the most expensive health insurance plans, a source close to the discussions told CNN Monday. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, is the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As expected, the proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, excludes the public insurance option to compete with private insurers. However, it would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives -- an idea that some moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed possible interest in supporting. The potential compromise proposal was sent to key Finance Committee negotiators Saturday night. It is considered a last-ditch effort to secure Republican votes for a health-care bill as President Obama pushes the issue with a planned speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. So far, none of the three Republican senators involved in talks with Baucus on the compromise have indicated whether they support the version he is proposing. Congressional liberals are pushing strongly for inclusion of a public option; conservatives are sharply opposed. Obama has said he supports a public option but has not clearly indicated he will veto a bill that fails to include it. On Monday, Obama reiterated his support for a public option in a Labor Day speech to a union gathering in Cincinnati. He outlined Democratic health-care proposals that include a public option as part of a menu of insurance choices, including private health-care plans, that the legislation would create. \\"I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs,\\" Obama said to loud cheers. The president also indicated he would push hard for the House and Senate to move forward on passing health-care legislation in his upcoming address to Congress. \\"The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months,\\" Obama said. \\"And the debate has been good, and that's important because we have to get this right. \\"But every debate at some point comes to an end,\\" he continued, to growing applause. \\"At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. And Ohio, it's time to act to get this done.\\" Baucus' bill would cost less than 900 billion over 10 years, according to the source who spoke to CNN. The price tag is at least 100 billion less than any other health-care reform bill under consideration by Congress, the source said. As with other reform proposals, the bill would bar insurance companies from dropping a policyholder in the event of illness as long as that person has paid his or her premium in full. It adds new protections for people with pre-existing conditions and establishes tax credits to help low and middle-income families purchase insurance coverage, the source noted. It creates health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to buy insurance. The bill would be paid for, in part, by a new tax on health insurance companies that provide high-end \\"Cadillac\\" insurance plans, the source added. Supporters of such a tax -- initially proposed by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats several weeks ago -- say will it help curb the cost of health care by discouraging employers from offering such plans. They also argue that consumers, in turn, will be discouraged from overusing the health care system.  Watch senators discuss health care talks ». Critics claim the new tax will cause insurance companies to raise rates on all of their customers, even those without more expensive plans. The so-called \\"Gang of Six\\" Senate negotiators -- a group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee -- is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the proposal. The source, while stressing that the proposed bill is not a final product, said it closely reflects the group's work and areas of agreement. Obama's planned speech to Congress reflects how overhauling the nation's ailing health-care system has become his top domestic priority. He laced his speech Monday with references to health care costs rising at three times the rate of wages, and insurance industry practices that deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or prevent people from obtaining coverage if they lose their jobs. Multiple sources told CNN Friday that the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after the president's address. One source called the possibility of new legislation a \\"contingency\\" approach if efforts by Baucus to craft a deal fall through. A big open question is whether two Republican members of the Gang of Six -- Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming -- will support the bipartisan proposal. White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on. A source close to the White House said Friday that the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option, and continues to zero in on trying to convince moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, another of the Senate Finance Committee negotiators, to come on board. Snowe and the White House have been discussing a trigger provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes are not met. Support by Snowe would improve the chances of the Senate's Democratic majority to compile the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster against a health care bill. The Senate Finance Committee is the last of five congressional committees needed to approve health-care legislation before it can be taken up by the full Senate and House of Representatives. Different forms of the legislation proposed by Democrats have already cleared three House committees, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

News article: CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court on Monday convicted three journalists from Al-Jazeera English and sentenced them to seven years in prison each on terrorism-related charges, bringing widespread criticism that the verdict was a blow to freedom of expression.

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this May 3, 2014 file photo, Al-Jazeera's award-winning Australian correspondent Peter Greste appears in a defendants' cage in the Police Academy courthouse along with several other defendants... (Associated Press)      The three, Australian Peter Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, have been detained since a December raid on their Cairo hotel room, which they were using as an office as they covered protests by supporters of the ousted Islamist president. The raid was part of a broad crackdown against Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.      They had pleaded innocent, saying they were simply doing their jobs as journalists. But they were charged with supporting the Brotherhood, which has been declared a terrorist organization, and of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war.      The prosecution provided little evidence in the case, showing video footage found in their possession — most of which had nothing to do with the case, including a report on a veterinary hospital in Cairo, Christian life and old footage of Greste from previous assignments elsewhere in Africa.      \\"I swear they will pay for this,\\" Fahmy, who was Al-Jazeera English's acting Cairo bureau chief, shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced in the Cairo court Monday. Greste, a correspondent, raised his fists in the air.      \\"They just ruined a family,\\" said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session. He said they would appeal the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. \\"Everything is corrupt,\\" he said. Greste's brother Andrew said he was \\"gutted\\" and also vowed to appeal.      Australian Foreign Minister Julia Bishop said, \\"We are all shocked by this verdict,\\" adding that the government would contact newly elected Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and ask him to intervene in the case.      \\"The Australian government urges the new government of Egypt to reflect what message is being sent to the world,\\" she said. \\"We are deeply concerned that this verdict is part of a broader attempt to muzzle media freedoms.\\"      The three received sentences of seven years each in a maximum security prison. Mohammed, the team's producer, received an extra three years because of additional charges of possession of ammunition. Al-Jazeera has said that charge was rooted in a spent shell found in his possession — a souvenir he'd picked up from protests.      There were 17 other co-defendants in the case. Among them, two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and eight others being tried in absentia each received 10-year prison sentences. Two of them were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. Most of the co-defendants were students, arrested separately and accused of giving footage to the journalists.      The managing director of Qatar-based Al-Jazeera English, Al Anstey, said in a statement that \\"not a shred of evidence was found to support the extraordinary and false charges against them.\\"      \\"To have detained them for 177 days is an outrage. To have sentenced them defies logic, sense, and any semblance of justice,\\" he said.      The arrests of the journalists were part of a broad crackdown on the Brotherhood and other Islamists who have been holding protests since the July 3 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi by el-Sissi, the head of the military at the time. Security forces have killed hundreds of Morsi supporters and arrested thousands more.      The crackdown has already raised fears of suppression of any form of dissent, since police have also arrested non-Islamist opponents, largely for breaking a draconian law passed in December banning protests without a prior police permit.      Attending the session, Canadian ambassador David Drake said there are many questions over the verdict.      \\"We are very disappointed,\\" he said. \\"We are digesting this ... We have to put our faith in the judicial system. We don't understand this particular verdict.\\"      British ambassador James Watt also said he was disappointed, adding, \\"Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy.\\"      Before the verdicts, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday he spoke with el-Sissi over the weekend and told him that Greste was innocent. \\"I did make the point that as an Australian journalist, Peter Greste would not have been supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, he would have simply been reporting on the Muslim Brotherhood,\\" Abbott told reporters in Canberra.      \\"The point I made was that in the long run, a free and vigorous media are good for democracy, good for security, (and) good for stability,\\" he said. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The verdicts were \\"feared but expected\\" by relatives, reports Christian Fraser      Three al-Jazeera journalists accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood have been jailed for seven years in Egypt.

Solve this instance: 17729 Student:","output":"Yes To solve this instance, I started by understanding the definition of a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. This means that a prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. To determine if 17729 is a prime number, I needed to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 17729. I used the following method: 1. Start with the lowest possible divisor, 2. 2. Divide 17729 by the current divisor and check if the result is a whole number. 3. If the result is a whole number, then 17729 is not a prime number and the answer is 'No'. 4. If the result is not a whole number, increase the divisor and repeat steps 2-3. 5. Continue this process until the divisor is greater than the square root of 17729, as any divisor larger than the square root will have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root. By following this method and not finding any divisors other than 1 and 17729, I determined that 17729 is a prime number.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic lights on red on the Naas Dual Carriageway when a motorcycle with two men on it pulls up beside her.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Veronica Guerin,\\" Guerin is mourned by her family, friends, colleagues, and the public. Her immediate family includes her husband Graham, her young son Cathal, her mother Bernie, and her brother Jimmy. They all deeply mourn her loss, as they had witnessed firsthand the risks associated with her determined investigative journalism and had implored her to stop for the sake of her own safety. Guerin's colleagues at the Sunday Independent also grieve for her, as she was a passionate and dedicated reporter who was committed to unveiling the truth behind the illegal drug trade plaguing Dublin's working-class citizens. Her death is not only a personal loss for those who knew her well, but it also highlights the severe threats and real-life consequences that journalists can face in the line of duty. Additionally, the public mourns Guerin's tragic and untimely death, as she had become a symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity. Her fearless confrontation of criminal elements in pursuit of the truth demonstrated how one person's actions can have a significant impact on society. Her death sparked outrage in the community and led to changes in Ireland's legislation, making her a martyr and an inspiration for other journalists and citizens committed to raising awareness about and combating organized crime. In summary, Guerin is mourned by a wide range of people, including her family, friends, colleagues, and the public at large. Her brave and tireless efforts to expose the criminal underworld of the drug trade in Dublin turned her into a towering figure, and her tragic death ultimately helped create a positive impact in the fight against organized crime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: More than 50 university courses across UK awarded students a First or 2:1. Number achieving 2:1 or above has leapt over five years at some institutions. Critics say grades have been pushed up as a 'marketing ploy' Universities said the rises reflected improvements in A-level grades. Article:","output":"Title: The Rise in University Grades: A Reflection of Higher Education's Success or a Marketing Ploy? Introduction: Over the past five years, more than 50 university courses across the UK have seen a significant increase in the number of students being awarded a First or 2:1. This dramatic leap has caught the attention of both the academic community and critics alike, leading to debates on whether this rise is indicative of improvements in A-level grades or simply a marketing strategy used by universities to attract more students.  Body: To give a clearer picture, it is important to understand what a First and a 2:1 degree classification entails in the UK educational system. A First is the highest degree classification awarded, generally equivalent to a GPA of 3.7 or above in the US. A 2:1 degree, on the other hand, is slightly lower but still considered an upper second class honours, similar to a GPA between 3.0 and 3.7.  According to recent data, the number of students achieving a 2:1 or above has dramatically increased at some institutions over the past five years, sparking concerns among experts about grade inflation. Critics argue that universities have been pushing up grades as a 'marketing ploy' to improve their reputation and rankings, thus attracting more prospective students and increasing enrollment numbers.  However, many universities maintain that the observed rise in First and 2:1 awards is a reflection of improvements in A-level grades. They argue that the students entering universities today are better prepared academically and therefore, more likely to achieve higher degree classifications than their predecessors. This explanation is backed by the fact that over the past few years, A-level results have been consistently improving, with more students achieving higher grades and securing their places in top universities.  The debate between the merit-based and marketing-driven explanations highlights essential questions regarding the state of the UK's higher education system. On one hand, the academic community acknowledges the importance of providing equal opportunities for students from all backgrounds. If the increase in degree classifications is attributed to improvements in A-level grades, it could be seen as a positive indication that students across the UK are benefiting from a stronger education system and better support at school.  On the other hand, if the rise is indeed a byproduct of a university marketing ploy, it could have far-reaching consequences. Grade inflation may cause employers to have less trust in degree classifications, potentially devaluing the worth of university degrees altogether. Moreover, those students who genuinely worked hard and achieved high grades might feel undermined, as the raised degree classifications obscure their individual achievements.  Conclusion: The ongoing debate about the rise in First and 2:1 degree classifications across UK universities highlights the complex interplay between academic excellence and marketing strategies. It is essential to continue monitoring trends in A-level performance and university degree classifications to ensure that UK higher education remains credible and valuable for students as they embark on their professional journeys. As stakeholders, universities, the government, and employers must work together to maintain a fair and accurate system that rewards genuine achievement and fosters a well-educated workforce for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Jets quickly drove downfield on their first possession, scoring their first touchdown in the first quarter all season. Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets got that right back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey. But Detroit's ensuing onside kick failed, and the Jets ran out the clock.

Fonda and the young music icon discussed various topics during their time together, including the idea of immortality and legacy. Jackson, who was already making a significant impact on the music industry at the time, spoke passionately about his desire to continue creating art that would resonate with people long after his physical presence was gone. Fonda listened intently as Jackson shared his dreams and aspirations, noting that the singer's determination and conviction were truly admirable. She could see that beneath his gentle exterior, there was a burning desire for greatness and a deep understanding of the power he held as an influential artist. As they explored the ranch together, Fonda noticed how taken Jackson was with the natural beauty of the Santa Barbara landscape. The rolling hills, magnificent oak trees, and peaceful tranquility of the area seemed to have a profound impact on him – so much so, that he would later acquire the property that came to be known as Neverland Ranch. The ranch would become Jackson's sanctuary, where he could escape the pressures of fame and focus on his artistic vision, as well as provide a place for children from all around the world to experience the magic and wonder that defined his own childhood dreams. Years later, when reflecting on their time together on her ranch, Fonda couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in knowing that she played a small role in inspiring Jackson to find his personal haven. Although the King of Pop's life was not without its share of controversy and tragedy, Fonda remembered him as the passionate, optimistic young artist she had introduced to the beautiful world of Santa Barbara. Throughout his life, even in the face of adversity, Jackson continued to insist that he would never truly die – and in many ways, he was right. His music and influence continue to be felt today and are certain to endure for generations to come. In this sense, Jackson's youthful belief in his own immortality serves as a testament to his enduring impact on the world and the lasting power of art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The app claims that it allows you to easily back up your SMS to various platforms like Gmail and Google Drive, but the process of setting up the backup is so complicated and frustrating that I ended up feeling discouraged. Even though I managed to connect the app with my Google Drive account eventually, I faced multiple issues while attempting synchronization. The primary reason I downloaded the app was to ensure that my text messages were securely backed up and accessible from other devices. However, the app failed miserably in this department. I had constant issues with syncing, and the app would often display error messages that I did not understand. Moreover, some of my important messages went missing while I was trying to transfer my SMS history. To add insult to injury, when I reached out to customer service, they were unresponsive and unhelpful. In addition to the syncing issues, the lack of reliable security features in the app is deeply concerning. There is no option for two-factor authentication, and the app did not ask for any permissions from me when connecting to my Gmail account. Furthermore, there is no clear privacy policy or terms of service, making it impossible to trust the app with sensitive data. Lastly, the app has constant stability issues that need to be addressed urgently. It would often crash or freeze on me without any warning. Nothing is more frustrating than losing valuable time attempting to resolve these issues – time that could be better spent on other more important tasks. Given that there are many alternative SMS syncing apps available on the market, I would advise everyone to steer clear of com.zegoggles.smssync. Don't waste your time with this app. With a confusing interface, extremely unreliable synchronization, lackluster security, nonexistent customer support, and pervasive stability issues, this app is not worth the storage space it takes up on your device. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. However, I'll have to settle for giving it an unimpressive 1-star rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines...

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"?  Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

As the Supreme Court gets ready to announce whether President Barack Obama's heath-care reform is constitutional, some Democrats hope it strikes down the law. They believe bad news for ObamaCare is good political news for Mr. Obama. Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that half the voters \\"think the whole thing is political\\" so if the law is overturned, Republicans \\"will own\\" the health-care issue as costs \\"escalate unbelievably.\\" Democrats can profit at the polls by saying, \\"We tried, we did something.\\" But Democrats should be careful what they wish for. ObamaCare is not popular; striking down the law in part or completely is. For example, in the June 5 Fox News poll, only 40% favor the new health-care law while 49% oppose it. Just 30% would prefer the Supreme Court to uphold it, while 21% favor the court striking down the law's individual mandate to buy health insurance at age 26, and 38% want the entire statute declared unconstitutional. A New York Times/CBS News poll earlier this month was even worse for the law, finding that 34% of Americans support ObamaCare (18% strongly) while 48% disapprove (36% strongly). Only 24% want to keep the entire law while 27% want the individual mandate gone and 41% want the entire law struck down.

Summarize this article: (CNN) The \\"Jurassic Park\\" image of a Tyrannosaurus rex baring a mouthful of ferocious teeth may be getting a facelift.      New research suggests that theropods -- those \\"beast-footed\\" terrestrial carnivores -- had lips and gums that covered most of their teeth, challenging toothy ideas of what they looked like.      University of Toronto vertebrate paleontologist Robert Reisz presented the findings Friday at the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting (PDF) in Mississauga, Ontario.      \\"In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case,\\" Reisz said in a news release      To test the hypothesis that lips covered theropod dinosaurs' teeth when the mouth was closed, Reisz and colleague Derek Larson examined dental anatomy and modern-day reptilian predators, including crocodiles and monitor lizards.      Crocodiles have exposed teeth, much like a \\"Jurassic Park\\" predator, while monitor lizards have teeth concealed behind scaly lips, similar to the movie version of velociraptors, he said.      Lips protect teeth enamel from drying out in part by keeping them hydrated, Reisz said.      \\"We propose that this requirement of hydration is not possible to maintain if the tooth is exposed permanently,\\" he said.      To test their theory they examined tusks, the exposed teeth of terrestrial mammals that don't have enamel, and compared them with the large teeth of theropod dinosaurs, known to have well-preserved enamel. They concluded that theropod teeth \\"were not exposed permanently, but covered by reptilian lips\\" similar to those found on various scaled lizards.      Then why do crocodiles, the closer relatives to dinosaurs, have exposed teeth? One might think crocodiles would be the logical choice for comparing teeth, \\"except that they are aquatic, while dinosaurs are mostly terrestrial,\\" Reisz said.      In other words, crocodiles spend their time submerged in water and don't need lips for hydration protection.      \\"Thus, the comparison is flawed,\\" Reisz said in an email. \\"Their teeth are kept hydrated by an aquatic environment.\\"      On the other hand, reptiles with lips, such as monitor lizards, typically live on land where their teeth require different protection.

While the research is ongoing, he has a theory for why we insist on toothy grins for T-rexes: To match \\"their impressive size.\\" ||||| Can a crocodile’s smile reveal whether dinosaurs had lips? What if lips and gums hid most of dinosaur's teeth?      New findings from University of Toronto vertebrate palaeontologist Robert Reisz challenge the idea of what therapods might have looked like when dinosaurs roamed the earth.      His research will be presented today at a conference at U of T Mississauga – and it's already making headlines.      “When we see dinosaurs in popular culture, such as in the movie Jurassic Park, we see them depicted with big teeth sticking out of their mouths,” Reisz says. Large dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, bare a ferocious grin, while smaller creatures such as velociraptors are shown with scaly lips covering their teeth.      The U of T Mississauga expert was curious about which version might be most accurate. “We have very little information about dinosaurs’ soft tissue,” he says.      For clues about how therapods might have appeared, he looked to modern-day reptilian predators like crocodiles and monitor lizards. According to Reisz, lipless crocodiles have exposed teeth, much like a Jurassic Park predator, while monitor lizards conceal teeth behind scaly lips that are similar to the movie version of velociraptors.      Lips help to protect teeth, in part by helping to enclose them in a moist environment where they won’t dry out, Reisz says. Crocodiles, which spend their time submerged in water, don’t need lips for protection. “Their teeth are kept hydrated by an aquatic environment,” Reisz says.      Reptiles with lips, such as monitor lizards, typically live on land (much like their movie counterparts) where their teeth require different protection. From this, Reisz concludes that dinosaur teeth would likely have been covered by scaly lips.      “It’s also important to remember that teeth would have been partially covered by gums. If we look at where the enamel stops, we can see that a substantial portion of the teeth would be hidden in the gums. The teeth would have appeared much smaller on a living animal.      “In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case.”      (Below: Gorgosaurus using its specialized teeth for feeding on a young Corythosaurus/image credit: Danielle Default)      Reisz presents his findings on May 20 at the annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Palaeontolgy at UTM. The two-day conference, which began on May 19, brings together 60 Canadian researchers working in Canada and around the globe.      “Canada has some very significant locations for understanding vertebrate evolution, ranging from the late Cretaceous in Alberta to the Pleistocene in the Arctic and the early stages of terrestrial vertebrate evolution in the Atlantic region,” says Reisz, who helped to organized the conference.      “There are about 1,000 people worldwide who study vertebrate fossils. It’s important to come together and exchange ideas and unite a community that is so widespread geographically.”      The conference features presentations on the latest research in palaeontology, including a crocodile-like creature from Sudan discovered by U of T researcher David Evans; a talk on the evolution of how birds hear; what a recently discovered ceratops from Montana tells us about horned dinosaurs; and deciphering the social behaviour of oviraptorsaurs found in Mongolia. ||||| New research takes aim at the fanged portrayal of the T rex, suggesting enamel on its teeth was probably kept moist by thin, scaly lips much like those of lizards      Its image is one of a fierce predator who towered over most others, baring dozens of jagged, bone-crushing teeth.      But new research out of Toronto seeks to challenge depictions of the Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting that its fearsome incisors might have been hidden behind a pair of lips.      “In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case,” said Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto. In research presented Friday at a conference of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he takes aim at the fanged portrayal of the T rex, suggesting its teeth did not stick out when its mouth was closed.      The truth of the tyrannosaurus - podcast Read more      The theory is based on the layer of thin enamel that covered the teeth of the T rex and fellow theropods. Reisz turned to modern-day reptiles to see how they keep this fragile enamel hydrated and protect their teeth from rotting. “If you have your teeth sticking out, you can’t hydrate the enamel. You can’t maintain it properly.”      Crocodiles get around this by spending time in water while monitor lizards have lips to protect the enamel on their teeth. Given that the T rex lived on land, the enamel on its teeth was probably kept moist by thin, scaly lips much like those of lizards. “People have a hard time wrapping their mind around the idea of teeth that are in excess of 10-15cm still being in the mouth,” Reisz said. “But it’s all a matter of some big-headed animals.”      The research is ongoing, but Reisz said most so far had welcomed the theory. He expected it to stir up some controversy among those responsible for depicting how dinosaurs might have looked millions of years ago, however.      The idea of lips on the T rex is not as far-fetched as it sounds, he said. Small theropods such as velociraptors are already often depicted with lips. It’s just the larger theropods, such as the T rex, who are almost always shown with their teeth exposed.      Still, he acknowledged that the theory might come as a blow to the dinosaur’s fierce image. “Maybe to children and a general audience they might look less ferocious without their teeth sticking out. But they are still big, impressive animals that were the top predators of their time.” ||||| Meat-eating dinosaurs' teeth were long thought to stick out of their mouths like a crocodile's — but that might not have been the case.      T. rex may have had lips. Yes, you read that right. Lips.      Robert Reisz, a paleontologist at the University of Toronto, is challenging the long-standing image of meat-eating theropod dinosaurs such as T. rex. Specifically, Reisz suggests that theropods' teeth were not bared all the time, extending outside their mouths and fully visible whether their jaws were open or closed. Rather, these teeth were kept hidden, covered by scaly lips, he said in a presentation May 20 at the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting in Ontario. [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]      Reisz told Live Science in an email that he had always been bothered by the typical \\"permanent smile\\" portrayal of theropod dinosaur teeth. He first looked to the closest living relatives of theropod dinosaurs — crocodiles — for clues about tooth exposure.      At first glance, it could seem like the expectation for large theropods to have exposed teeth was on the right track. Crocodiles' teeth are covered by gums for about one-quarter of their length, but lips are absent and the tooth crowns are permanently exposed, Reisz explained.      However, if you look closer at tooth structure, a different story might emerge, he noted in his presentation.      The hard enamel of animals' teeth has low water content, and is typically kept hydrated by saliva. Without lips to keep moisture in and prevent the teeth from drying out, the tough enamel would become brittle and more prone to damage and wear, Reisz told Live Science.      Crocodiles live in watery environments and would rely on their habitat to keep exposed teeth hydrated. But land-dwelling theropods' large teeth — which are known to have enamel — could have been compromised by perpetual exposure, and likely needed to be covered by lips in order to stay moist, Reisz said in the presentation.      But crocodiles aren't the only animals with exposed teeth — elephants, for instance, have exposed teeth as well, and many extinct saber-toothed predators had very long canines that were also exposed when their mouths were closed. Wouldn't their teeth have been vulnerable to serious drying out, too?      Not necessarily. A mammal's tooth structure is actually quite different from a reptile's, said Zhijie Jack Tseng, a paleontologist who studies bite-force biomechanics in extinct carnivores at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.      \\"Mammalian teeth are prismatic — they have a crisscrossing structure,\\" Tseng told Live Science. He explained that when mammal teeth grow, the enamel emerges from the root area and \\"races outward in all directions,\\" creating a 3D shape that may be better at keeping water inside.      In reptile teeth, the enamel grows in one direction, creating a different type of structure that may not retain water as effectively — potentially making their teeth more likely to chip or crack, Tseng suggested.      But for reptiles — and theropod dinosaurs — damaging or losing a tooth simply isn't as big a deal as it would be for a mammal, Tseng added. Mammals typically grow a set of baby teeth followed by a set of adult teeth, whereas reptiles — and likely many, if not all, dinosaurs — replace individual teeth throughout their lifetimes, scientists have found.      \\"Each tooth — relatively speaking — doesn't have as much value to the animal as in mammals,\\" Tseng said. \\"T. rex could chip a tooth or get one stuck in prey, and just replace it. Evolving protection for teeth is not a critical component of how they eat.\\"      Reisz suggested in a statement that people may be reluctant to abandon the terrifying but familiar image of a \\"ferocious-looking\\" T. rex with bared teeth.      But now more than ever, scientists are challenging traditional ideas about how dinosaurs may have looked and behaved. New fossil evidence, computer modeling and comparisons with living creatures are helping scientists to paint a clearer picture of these extinct animals, overturning many historic conceptions of their postures, gaits, skin coverings and colors.      Long gone are the days when dinosaurs were almost uniformly pictured as grayish-green, ponderous reptiles with scaly skin. Contrary to their portrayal in popular films, dinosaurs are now widely accepted by scientists as having been covered in feathers, possibly in a range of colors, much like the colorful plumage of modern birds, which are a living dinosaur lineage.      Is it really so far-fetched to suggest that T. rex's toothy grin should also be relegated to the past? Time — and further research — will tell, Reisz said.      Original article on Live Science. ||||| Summary:","output":"Scientists have recently discovered that the Tyrannosaurus rex, a big dinosaur, might not have had his big sharp teeth showing all the time, like we see in movies. Instead, they found that dinosaurs may have had scaly lips that covered their teeth, just like some reptiles that live today. This is because if their teeth were always sticking out, it would be hard to keep them clean and strong. By having lips, their teeth would be much healthier. So, even though they might not look as scary as we thought, dinosaurs were still amazing creatures!"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs.

Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.  - Windows NT is a family of operating systems produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released in July 1993.

Read this and answer the question The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context, starting from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. \\"Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.\\" What idea did social science add to science as a whole?","output":"The idea that social science added to the field of science as a whole is the recognition of the significant influence of sociological, intellectual, cultural, economic, and political factors on the development and evolution of scientific knowledge. This perspective broadened the understanding of scientific progress beyond a solely positivist approach, which focused on the empirical and logical aspects of science. By introducing the concept of competing paradigms and emphasizing the historical context and human interactions involved in scientific endeavors, Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions underscored the role of the wider social environment in shaping scientific perspectives, theories, and methods. This idea shifted the study of science towards a more interdisciplinary approach, taking into account the various forces impacting scientific development and inviting researchers from diverse fields to contribute to the understanding of science in a broader socio-historical context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What views does Scout contend with? Answer:","output":"Scout contends with views on gender roles, racism, and classism. The female characters who comment on her lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role promote racist and classist points of view.

It also reflects commitment and honor, two important elements of chivalry. For example, simple texts like “Hey, just wanted to tell you good morning” or “Good morning! I’ll be thinking of you today” can really brighten your partner’s day. If there’s someone behind you, help them by holding the door regardless of their gender or whether you know them. This kind of common courtesy is an important part of chivalry.  For example, if you see someone coming in behind you with their arms full, you should hold the door for them. You should also hold the door for your partner, but only if they’re comfortable with it. Some people like to open the door for themselves as a sign of independence. This is another chivalrous action previously reserved just for women. However, you should apply this kindness to anyone who isn’t as physically fit and may need a seat, such as a pregnant, ill, or elderly person. For example, if you’re sitting on the bus and you see an elderly woman standing up, you could say, “Excuse me, ma’am, would you like this seat?” and offer her your spot. If you see someone being mistreated or bullied, chivalry means stepping in and helping the victim. Stepping in can be difficult to do in the moment, but standing up for others can also be as simple as asking the victim if they need any help or calling for help from a law enforcement official or another bystander.  Standing up for others shows chivalrous qualities such as bravery, honor, and loyalty to your principles. For example, if you see someone being harassed on the subway or the street, you could step in and ask the victim if they need any help. This takes the attention away from the harasser and gives the victim some control over the situation. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening or the situation seems risky, you can also approach the victim afterwards and ask them if they need help. Whether you’re interacting with a family member, a significant other, or a stranger, being respectful is an essential part of chivalry. You can show respect through being polite, listening carefully, and valuing others’ opinions.  For example, always be respectful to waitstaff at restaurants. When they bring you your food or refill your water glass, remember to say thank you instead of just ignoring the action. If your significant other is telling you about their day, you can show them respect by listening attentively and asking questions to show them that you’re interested.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of chivalry through acts of kindness, courtesy, respect, and standing up for others, showcasing commitment, honor, and politeness in various situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase, it credits the seller's reserve account (with the Federal Reserve). This money is not transferred from any existing funds—it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new high-powered money. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department.

Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which organization orders existing funds?","output":"It is not possible to provide a single organization that orders existing funds, since the management and ordering of existing funds depend on the context of the financial operation involved. However, some entities frequently deal with handling and managing different types of funds. Here are a few examples: 1. Central banks: Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, manage their respective country's monetary policy and can create new high-powered money, as explained in the initial description. They also have the authority to buy and sell government securities, which influences the amount of money circulating in the economy. 2. Commercial banks: Commercial banks order and manage funds for their customers in both savings and checking accounts. They facilitate the movement of funds between their customers and ensure the smooth operation of financial transactions. 3. Investment banks: Investment banks are institutions that deal with existing funds in terms of investments, trading, and underwriting activities. They facilitate the flow of funds between investors and corporations or governments issuing securities. 4. Asset management companies: These companies are engaged in managing existing funds on behalf of investors, aiming to achieve growth and manage the risk of investments. They typically make investment decisions and allocate assets based on their clients' preferences, investment goals, and risk tolerance. 5. Government agencies: Government agencies are responsible for allocating public funds, as directed by the government's budget, to various programs and public works. This includes distributing funds to different departments, agencies, and public services.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of Vi Rose Hill's two teens? from the following article ?  After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director in Pacashau, Georgia, Vi Rose Hill, a no-nonsense mother raising two teens alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow, the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \\"Joyful Noise\\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter, who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia. But Olivia is not ready to date under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy. A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny. At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style.

Æthelred became the ruler of English Mercia after the death of its last king, Ceolwulf II, in 879. His rule was confined to the western half of Mercia, as the eastern half was then part of the Viking-ruled Danelaw. 2. His ancestry is unknown, making it difficult to trace his lineage and familial connections. 3. Æthelred was likely the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881. After this defeat, he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex, forming an alliance with him. 4. The alliance with King Alfred was cemented through the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred's daughter, Æthelflæd. 5. In 886, Alfred took possession of London, which had traditionally been a Mercian town. He then handed control of the city to Æthelred. 6. In 892, the Vikings renewed their attacks, and Æthelred led a combined army of Mercians, West Saxons, and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. 7. Over the next three years, Æthelred fought alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder, against the Vikings. 8. It is believed that during the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health may have declined, and Æthelflæd may have assumed the role of the effective ruler of Mercia. 9. After Æthelred's death in 911, Æthelflæd ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. 10. The couple had only one child, a daughter named Ælfwynn, who briefly ruled as Lady of the Mercians after Æthelflæd's death until she was deposed by her uncle, King Edward. In summary, Æthelred was the ruler of western Mercia after King Ceolwulf II's death and formed a significant alliance with King Alfred the Great through his marriage to Æthelflæd. He fought battles against the Vikings and later handed over control of western Mercia to his wife Æthelflæd due to his declining health. After his death, Æthelflæd and their daughter Ælfwynn ruled as leaders of Mercia until King Edward eventually took control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.Architectural historian S.

Billy says that he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release. Billy goes with the police to a nearby market and points out the cab driver, but when they go to arrest the cabbie, it becomes apparent that the police have no intention of keeping their end of the deal with Billy. He sees an opportunity and makes a run for it, only to get cornered and recaptured by the mysterious American. During his first night in holding at a local jail, a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. Later that night, he is rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. He wakes a few days later in Sağmalcılar Prison, surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who is in for stealing two candlesticks from a mosque), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swede, also in for drug smuggling), who help him to his feet. Jimmy tells Billy that the prison is a dangerous place for foreigners like them and that no one can be trusted, even young children.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the real name of the person who honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers?  In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the full names of the people whose remains were found on Herald Island? ?  Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who was approved as king?  Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

This will inform you exactly what your revenues and expenses are and will help you create more savings to reduce debt.   List all your sources of income and add them up. Move on to list your necessities. These include essential needs that are due regularly like rent, utilities, car payments, food, communication, and debt repayments. Keep in mind that just because these are essential or fixed expenses does not mean that they cannot be greatly reduced to find savings. List your discretionary expenses. Discretionary expenses are costs that you can change or avoid altogether such as buying new clothing or eating dinner out. The best way to get an idea of these expenses is to look at your bank or credit card statements for a month, and add up all the expenses that are not in your fixed expenses category. If you want better accuracy, take an average over several months and use this figure. Subtract your total expenses from your revenue. This is how much you have left over, or alternatively, how much extra you can afford to pay down to your credit cards. . Try to figure out how to decrease your expenses each month so that you can use more funds to pay down your credit cards. Target primarily variable expenses listed in your budget to find ways to save money.  Make meals at home instead of eating out. Make coffee at home instead of buying expensive coffee drinks. Delay expenses that can wait for later, like new clothes. Borrow books, music, and movies from the public library instead of buying them. Do not forget to look into your fixed expenses category as well. Can you move into more affordable housing? Find a roommate? Walk more to spend less on gas? Use a less extravagant plan for your cell phone (perhaps only 1GB of data a month instead of 3GB)? Once you have lowered spending using the above tips, you should be able to free additional money each month. Apply some of that additional income to your credit cards and save some for an emergency.   For example, upon creation of your budget you may observe you make 1500 per month, and have 1400 a month in expenses. After implementing the savings tips (for example, you drop down to a cheaper phone plan, stop eating out, and start walking to do basic errands), you manage to find 300 in savings. You now have 400 in additional cash. Perhaps 300 can go to your credit card debt and 100 can go into emergency savings. Don't forget to look at your income too. Are there ways to boost your income? Perhaps you can work more hours, look for a better job, or get a part-time job for ten extra hours a week. Make a list of your balances, interest, and fees every month.

Now, isolate the variable w by moving all w terms to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side. To do that, we add 45w to both sides of the equation. -54w + 45w = -45w + 45w - 99 -9w = -99 3.

Information:  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475  18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci.  - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder.  - Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 14522 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - The Portrait of a Cardinal is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael . It is housed in the Prado Museum in Madrid . The Cardinal has been identified as either Alidosi , Bibbiena , Cybo or Trivulzio , in the court of Pope Julius II. Painted in Rome , Rafael mastered the art of realism in his paintings , the ability to \`\` paint people as more real than they really are , '' as his peers put it . Like Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa , the subject is seated , with formation of a triangle pyramid by the subjects ' body and arms . The contrasts are striking between the red of his hat , whiteness of his sleeve and his face . Meticulous brushstrokes give the audience a three - dimensional character , revealing Rapahel 's interest in sculpture during those years . The painting was acquired by Carlos IV of Spain ( 1748 -- 1819 ) in Rome , while the latter was still a prince . The picture was attributed to Antonio Moro , due to its technique , considered unusual in Raphael .  - In art history, High Renaissance is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the \\"High Style\\" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.  - Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (March 28 or April 6, 1483April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.  - Urbino is a walled city in the Marche region of Italy, south-west of Pesaro, a World Heritage Site notable for a remarkable historical legacy of independent Renaissance culture, especially under the patronage of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. The town, nestled on a high sloping hillside, retains much of its picturesque medieval aspect, an illusion only slightly broken by the large car parks below the town. It hosts the University of Urbino, founded in 1506, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Urbino. Its best-known architectural piece is the Palazzo Ducale, rebuilt by Luciano Laurana.

Use all the basic cleaners, such as soap and water for the body and window cleaner for your windows. Can we draw the following conclusion? A vehicle can be cleaned before waxing.","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can draw the conclusion that a vehicle should be cleaned before waxing. Thoroughly cleaning the car is essential before applying the turtle wax in order to achieve optimal results. Cleaning not only helps in the performance of the wax but also helps in maintaining the vehicle's appearance and longevity.  Let's take a deeper dive into this process of properly using turtle wax on a car. To ensure a long-lasting shine, it's important to follow a series of steps when using turtle wax to give your car that sparkling clean effect: 1. Gather your supplies: What you'll need to clean and wax your car are car wash soap, water, a bucket, a hose or water source, window cleaner, microfiber towels, car waxes (such as Turtle Wax), and a sponge or applicator pad for applying the wax. 2. Car cleaning:    a) Begin by rinsing your vehicle with water to remove any loose debris.    b) Fill the bucket with the car wash soap and water. Ensure to follow the soap manufacturer's instructions on the proportions.    c) Use a microfiber wash mitt to gently scrub your car in sections, starting from the top and working your way down.    d) After scrubbing each section, rinse away soap with water immediately to avoid soap residue.    e) Make sure to clean the wheels and tires with a separate mitt, sponge, or brush dedicated to that purpose.    f) Rinse the entire vehicle once more, and use a microfiber towel to dry it. Do not let the car air dry, as this can lead to water spots. 3. Window cleaning: Properly clean windows and windshield with glass cleaner to avoid streaks and to remove any water spots or dirt. 4. Applying the Turtle Wax:    a) Ensure the car is completely dry and parked in a shady area before proceeding with wax application.    b) Dip a clean sponge or applicator pad into the Turtle Wax. Use small amounts of wax to avoid clumps.    c) Divide your car into sections and, using the sponge or pad, apply the wax in a circular motion one section at a time. Work from the roof downwards, and make sure to evenly cover the entire surface.    d) Allow the wax to dry until it appears hazy. Turtle Wax usually takes approximately 5-10 minutes to dry, but this can depend on factors such as temperature and humidity.    e) After the wax is hazy, use a clean, dry microfiber towel to gently buff the wax from the surface of the car. Use circular motions and continue to buff until the wax residue is gone and a shiny finish is achieved. 5. Visual inspection: Inspect the car carefully and check if the finish is smooth, consistent, and shiny. If required, repeat the waxing process on areas where the finish is not satisfactory. Following these steps will help you achieve a thorough cleaning of your vehicle and a long-lasting shine using Turtle Wax. This process not only enhances your car's appearance but also helps to protect the paint job from various environmental factors that can damage it over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: If you have a puppy, it's fairly easy to determine its age by examining its teeth. Teeth start developing during a puppy's first year. The stage of teeth development is tied to a puppy's approximate age.  At one month old, teeth will have just started pushing through the gums. At two months, a puppy will have a full set of deciduous (baby) teeth near the front of the mouth. At four months, adult canines and incisors will start to come in. By seven months, a puppy will have a full set of adult teeth and will have developed molars in the back of the mouth. When a puppy reaches a year old, you should notice ridges or bumps on both the lower and upper top front teeth. Keep in mind that teeth tend to erupt later in toy dog breeds. As a dog ages, their teeth change. Changes in teeth can help you assess a dog's approximate age.  Ridges on the incisors change as a dog ages. By the time the dog is three years old, the ridges will have worn off the bottom incisors. By five years old, the ridges will have worn off the upper incisors as well. A small amount of ridges on the upper front four teeth indicate your dog is between three and four. By seven, a dog's teeth are completely smooth. Older dogs tend to be less energetic than younger dogs. Senior dogs often have small benign lumps on the body. They will also be less interested in playing than younger dogs. They are generally less muscular than younger dogs. Cloudy eyes are a sign of natural hardening of the lens as the dog ages, and this is called lenticular sclerosis. If your dog shows other signs of aging, such as smooth teeth and low energy, lenticular sclerosis can help you confirm your dog is older than seven. Lenticular sclerosis and cataracts are not the same thing. Cataracts are white and opaque and they are also common in senior dogs. However, some dogs develop cataracts young due to genetic reasons. Cataracts will affect your dog's vision, whereas lenticular sclerosis will not. Fur color often changes as a dog ages. However, fur color is not the best means of determining age. However, when taken into account with other factors like teeth, fur may help determine a dog's age. Most dogs have some graying fur past the age of five. Graying hair is typically found around the muzzle. Some dogs gray as early as two, depending on their environment and genetic makeup. Fur color can help confirm a dog is older when taken into consideration alongside other factors, like teeth and activity level. It should not be used as the sole means to determine a dog's age. Larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans. They may show signs of aging younger than smaller dogs. Great Danes, for example, typically live around seven years while Chihuahuas often live well into their teens. A bigger dog may show signs of aging early. In general, you can assume a big dog showing significant signs of aging is around seven or eight while a small dog can be assumed to be ages 10 or up.","output":"This article discusses the various ways to determine a dog's age, primarily looking at the development and changes in their teeth, signs of aging in behavior, eyesight, fur color, and further considering the breed's size and lifespan factors. One of the main indicators of a puppy's age is the development of its teeth. Teeth begin to emerge through the gums at about one month old. By two months, a puppy has a full set of baby teeth near the mouth's front. As the puppy develops to four months, adult canines and incisors begin to appear, and by seven months, a full set of adult teeth will have emerged, including molars. At about a year old, puppies develop ridges or bumps on the upper and lower front teeth. However, it's noted that teeth development can vary, with toy dog breeds often having later teeth eruption.  As a dog ages, the teeth transform, providing clues about the dog's age. From three years, the ridges on the lower incisors begin to wear off, and by the fifth year, the upper incisor ridges do the same. When a dog turns seven, its teeth usually become completely smooth.  The dog's behavior, physical appearance, and eyesight changes can also indicate its age. Senior dogs, for example, usually have reduced energy levels, show less interest in playing, have less muscle mass, and may have small benign body lumps. Eye changes that involve a natural lens hardening process, known as lenticular sclerosis, can signify a dog's age beyond seven. Lenticular sclerosis, which leaves the eyes cloudy, is distinguished from cataracts, which cause opacity, with the latter affecting vision and often occurring in older dogs due to age and genetic factors.  The dogs’ fur color could change with age but is not the most reliable indicator of age. However, when considered with other factors like teeth conditions and activity levels, it becomes supportive evidence in age determination. Most dogs start to gray around the muzzle after turning five, although some may gray earlier due to environmental conditions or genetic predispositions. Finally, the dog's breed and size play significant roles in aging. Larger breeds tend to experience shorter life spans and show aging signs earlier compared to smaller breeds. Great Danes, for instance, average a lifespan of seven years, whereas Chihuahuas usually live into their teens. Therefore, a bigger dog showing significant aging signs may likely be around seven or eight, while a small dog with similar aging indications may be around ten or older. However, these should also be considered alongside other mentioned aging indicators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: After the rise of Young Turks to power through their 1908 revolution, they began imposing a more centralized system of rule across the Ottoman Empire. This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarrıf Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarrıf conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility. Question: How many years after the revolution did the Hauran Druze rebellion take place? Answer:","output":"The Young Turks came to power through their 1908 revolution. The Hauran Druze Rebellion took place in 1909. To calculate the difference in years: 1909 (year of the Hauran Druze Rebellion) - 1908 (year of the Young Turks Revolution) = 1 year So, the Hauran Druze Rebellion took place 1 year after the Young Turks revolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum.

Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  Now, I have a new situation: Kim and Jane inherited some land. Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.  Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.  Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

We show sadness and happiness through our expressions. But exactly how many emotions can our face make?Scientists used to believe we had six basic facial expressions that tell others how we feel: sad, happy, surprised, fearful, angry and disgusted  . But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues  .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor  \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened   their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks   and smiled to show being happy. We are not always aware of our facial expressions, which can hold clues to how we really feel. So these results may have a big impact   on medical treatment.

I wanted to use it during the day and have her pick it up after work sense she wasnt going to be playing it at work and i wanted to play stardew valley. She said that she was going to diner with her friends right after work and because of that(woeking past a little when it starts) she would be late, and she would be extra late if she went back to our house and picked it up(15 min drive). Where they are eating is undecided. So if it was close to our house or something for easy pick up it is unknown. She said since she doesnt use it as much as me she automactically gets it no arguement. I said that was dumb and that she doesnt automatically get it. My parents said she gets it. I suggest that we drop it off at her work or she picks it up after the meal.  My parents said she gets it and i said that there is no compromise here, so to fight that i have spent over 100 dollars on controllers and around that same amount on games too. So she gets the shared part but neither the games i paid for(smash, splatoon, minecraft, 2 wired controllers and a pro controller) or the controllers.  I say sense its a shared thing she can pay half for everything ive bought or not use what ive bought. In the end my dad said he would drive them to my sisters work 15 min away and drop them off.

Then tried to take the stuff i bought with my own money (controllers and games) and then my dad gave me a threat that seemed like it would just end really bad in my favor.

That works out to Williams being paid less than one-tenth of 1% of her male co-star.      Ridley Scott’s Getty kidnapping drama was hastily reshot the week of Thanksgiving after a cascade of sexual misconduct allegations were made public against Kevin Spacey, who had starred in the drama as billionaire J. Paul Getty.      More: Three major arguments happening around the Hollywood pay gap, explained      Scott transfixed the film world by quickly assembling his actors in Europe, reshooting Spacey’s scenes with Christopher Plummer — and still making his Christmas release window.      The wave of publicity that followed made All the Money in the World, distributed by Sony and financed by Imperative Entertainment, roll into Sunday’s Golden Globes as a relative triumph.      CLOSE Actor and 'All The Money In The World' star Mark Wahlberg discusses the recasting of Kevin Spacey's role and awards buzz during the movie's premiere in California. Newslook      But new information reveals ugly math behind the Hollywood victory. The reshoot cost 10 million (a fee put up by producing arm Imperative). In December, Scott told USA TODAY that the undertaking was aided by the fact that \\"everyone did it for nothing.”      The exchange went as follows:      RIDLEY SCOTT: “The whole reshoot was — in normal terms was expensive but not as expensive as you think. Because all of them, everyone did it for nothing.”      USA TODAY: “Really?”      SCOTT: “No, I wouldn’t get paid, I refused to get paid.”      USA TODAY: “You didn’t pay the actors more to do it?”      SCOTT: “No, they all came in free. Christopher had to get paid. But Michelle, no. Me, no. I wouldn’t do that to — ”      USA TODAY: “The crew, of course, did get paid?”      SCOTT: “Of course.”      USA TODAY has since learned Wahlberg's team actually negotiated a hefty fee, with the actor paid 1.5 million for his reshoots.

In August, Forbes named Wahlberg the highest-paid actor of the year, calculating his pretax and pre-fee earnings at 68 million. The Washington Post first reported Wahlberg's reshoot fee, noting that the actor “along with manager Stephen Levinson and agency WME, have a reputation in Hollywood for driving a tough bargain.”      Williams previously told USA TODAY that when Scott's team called to request her time for the reshoot, \\"I said I'd be wherever they needed me, whenever they needed me. And they could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted. Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort.\\"      All the Money in the World has lagged at the box office, this past weekend coming in 10th place. The drama has grossed 20.2 million since its release two weeks ago.      The pay disparity arrives as the entertainment industry continues to be rocked by the downfall of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a flood of sexual misconduct allegations against dozens of other powerful Hollywood figures and a rising #MeToo movement.      Two days ago at the Golden Globes, male and female stars wore black in solidarity with the newly established Time's Up initiative, which pushes for protection for victims of sexual harassment and gender inequality.      Williams, Globe-nominated for her role in All the Money in the World, was one of them.

While only three actresses made more than 20 million in 12 months, 16 actors broached the mark.      This pay disparity is due, in part, to roles: There are simply fewer main female characters in the superhero movies and blockbusters that pay the sizeable backend profits that result in leading men's large paydays, or the franchise sequels that permit aggressive negotiation for future installments. According to a 2016 study, women comprise just 28.7% of all speaking roles in movies.      In order to visualize the difference in paychecks, we combined our lists of highest-paid actors and actresses. Emma Stone, who was this year's top-ranked actress, lands at No. 15 when stacked up with the men. Mark Wahlberg, the highest-paid actor, made more than 2.5 times her 26 million pretax take-home. Melissa McCarthy, ranked No. 4 among actresses with 18 million, ties for No. 21 with Chris Evans.

Veteran director Scott conducted widely talked about reshoots on the crime drama in November to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer ahead of its December 22 domestic release.      Spacey was edited out of the film after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him, including an accusation from Star Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp.      But USA Today reports that Williams, the Golden Globe-winning and Academy Award-nominated, female lead star of the film was paid 1 percent of her male supporting co-star—despite receiving top billing on promotional artwork.      Williams, 37, received a 80 per diem stipend, effectively filming the reshoots for free, reports USA Today. Wahlberg’s agents, however, negotiated a fee of 1.5 million for the actor for the same reshoots, the newspaper says.

Thync shares science behind its brain-zapping wearable Thync has been steadily gathering attention for its far-out claim that its next-gen gadget, a wireless wearable electrode for your brain, can tune your mood. It offers two settings, “calm” and “energize.” The Boston company says its device can amp up your alertness like a shot of caffeine or mellow you out like a good massage — all with a precisely designed pulse of current. By and large, according to reports from tech media and technology and health professionals who have tried the device, it seems that Thync is delivering on its promise. (I tried it and felt significantly blissed-out afterward.) And for the first time, Thync has published a study that explains some of the magic behind the mad idea. It’s still awaiting peer review, but the study does provide an appetizer of experimental evidence that the device actually works. The move is unusual for tech companies, which are typically secretive about internal studies. But it’s in keeping with Thync’s goal of being transparent to its potential customers, said its cofounder and chief scientific officer, William “Jamie” Tyler. Publishing the paper is also an opportunity to present the device to the academic and medical communities. So how does it work? Touch-sensitive cranial nerves on your face already carry tactile information to the brain. Thync seems to have found a way to have a precise — and very mild — current of electricity piggy-back on that path and adjust the volume on the part of the brain that controls the stress response. The device is the size of a potato chip and clings to your temple; the pulses are controlled by an app on a smartphone. “We’re signaling the brain through a pathway that’s already there,” Tyler said. “It’s like the gas pedal in your car. Basically if you press down on the gas, you start going fast.” The timing for the study is no accident: The company plans to start selling the one-of-a-kind device this year, but has not decided on a price. “That’s why we’re ready to go to market — because we’re convinced by the science,” Tyler said. Unlike in electroshock therapy, the controversial treatment for conditions such as depression, Tyler said the intensity of the current from the device is lower than the electrical activity that’s already going on in the brain. Also, Thync plans to steer clear of medical applications and instead hopes to sell its product as a replacement for stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. Still, the company is in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about regulatory requirements, but has yet to disclose details. In the company’s tests, 82 subjects experienced a 14-minute session with the Thync device on the “calm” setting, and 14 minutes with a similarly shaped “sham” device that wasn’t electrified. Thync’s scientific team then documented physiological signs — sweat and body temperature, for example — as well as chemical ones, like looking for signs of a protein that is present in the early stages of a stress response. The calming effect was evident when the subjects wore the real device; it was absent when they wore the version without the current. “It’s not the complete story start to finish, but it’s interesting,” sad Alik Widge, who studies brain stimulation at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Division of Neurotherapeutics in the Department of Psychiatry. Researchers have been experimenting with electricity and the brain for decades, but Widge noted that Tyler and his crew at Thync are taking a fundamentally different approach by using stick-on electrodes rather than implanting them surgically. Such a device could be a great resource for researchers who are looking into brain-stimulation therapies for conditions like depression. If it works, that is. Widge said he wants to see more evidence that what we’re seeing is more than a placebo effect. “I look at this the same way I see a vitamin supplement or a food-as-medicine kind of thing — it’s certainly not going to hurt the person,” Widge said. Widge also said he was interested in seeing an independent lab replicate the results in follow-up studies, and he’d look to also monitor the results in an MRI scanner. Tyler said he is hoping for exactly this type of collaboration to occur.

The device, roughly the size of a potato chip, is placed on the user's temple, and an accompanying smartphone app controls the electrical pulses. Instead of targeting medical applications, such as the controversial electroshock therapy for depression, Thync aims to market their device as an alternative to stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. The company is currently in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration regarding regulatory requirements, although no details have been revealed. Overall, Thync's study showed promising results; participants experienced a calming effect when using the actual device but not when using a sham version without any electrical current. However, some researchers are calling for further independent studies to verify the effectiveness of Thync's technology and to discern whether the result is simply a placebo effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

What happened to the LinkedIn Research Network?","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They refer to distinct aspects of the LinkedIn platform. Question 1: Why are some names on the LinkedIn network a gray color? This question is concerned with the appearance of names on the LinkedIn platform, specifically regarding the color gray. There could be several reasons why some names appear in gray on the LinkedIn network: 1. Unconnected profiles: When browsing through search results or suggested connections, names in gray might indicate profiles with whom you are not currently connected. LinkedIn primarily uses the color gray to differentiate between connected and unconnected profiles. Once you connect with such profiles and they accept your connection request, the gray color usually changes. 2. Non-clickable profiles: Profiles that appear in gray and are not clickable might indicate that these users either have a limited profile or have chosen to keep their profile less visible to the public. LinkedIn offers users the option to manage their privacy settings, allowing them to hide specific information or make their profile less visible. 3. Deleted or Suspended accounts: On occasion, grayed-out names may represent profiles that have been deleted or temporarily suspended by the LinkedIn platform administration as a result of alleged scams, spamming, or violations of LinkedIn's User Agreement and policies. 4. Technical issues: Lastly, though less likely, there could be a technical issue or temporary glitch on LinkedIn, causing names to appear gray. Refreshing the page or restarting your browser and logging in again usually resolves such issues. Question 2: What happened to the LinkedIn Research Network? LinkedIn Research Network (LRN) was a specialized unit of LinkedIn that enabled market research professionals to connect, collaborate and exchange information. Launched in June 2008, LRN featured a mix of tools, features, and content to empower research professionals and knowledge workers in their daily tasks. However, the LinkedIn Research Network was closed in 2010. The decision to shut it down may have stemmed from several factors, including low user engagement, the need to refine LinkedIn's focus on its core services, and the evolving landscape of research and professional networking. After the shutdown, LinkedIn shifted its attention to enhancing its existing features and services aimed at helping professionals exchange ideas and knowledge. Some of these features include LinkedIn Groups and LinkedIn Pages, which provide companies and individuals with platforms to connect with their peers in their respective industries. In summary, while these two questions both relate to LinkedIn, they address different topics. The first question refers to the appearance and meaning of gray-colored names, while the second question inquires about the LinkedIn Research Network and its discontinuation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

La primera opción, \\"Teodora fue arrestada por la policía de Hayward debido a una identidad equivocada.\\" es una traducción más directa de la oración en inglés. Sin embargo, la segunda opción, \\"Teodora fue detenida por la policía de Hayward por un caso de confusión de identidad.\\" se enfoca más en el concepto de confusión o error en la identificación, lo cual puede hacerla sonar más natural en español a veces. Aquí te explico cada parte de la oración: 1. \\"Teodora\\" - el nombre de la persona en cuestión se mantiene igual en ambos idiomas. 2. \\"fue arrestada\\" / \\"fue detenida\\" - ambas opciones se usan para indicar que alguien ha sido arrestado o detenido por la policía. \\"Fue arrestada\\" es un poco más formal, mientras que \\"fue detenida\\" se utiliza comúnmente en conversaciones cotidianas. 3. \\"por la policía de Hayward\\" - esta parte especifica quién realizó el arresto. La palabra \\"policía\\" en español es tanto singular como plural, y se utiliza aquí en singular para referirse a la fuerza policial en general. \\"Hayward\\" se mantiene igual ya que es el nombre de una ciudad. 4. \\"debido a\\" / \\"por un caso de\\" - estos términos se utilizan para introducir la razón o el motivo detrás del arresto. \\"Debido a\\" puede traducirse como \\"because of\\" en inglés, mientras que \\"por un caso de\\" puede entenderse como \\"in a case of\\" en inglés. 5. \\"identidad equivocada\\" / \\"confusión de identidad\\" - ambas opciones reflejan el concepto de que el arresto fue causado por un error en la identificación de Teodora. \\"Identidad equivocada\\" sugiere que la policía se confundió al identificar a Teodora como alguien más. Mientras tanto, \\"confusión de identidad\\" hace hincapié en el hecho de que hubo una confusión o error involucrado en la situación. En resumen, ambas opciones ofrecen una traducción correcta y comprensible de la oración en inglés.

Answer the following question. The plays 'The Barber of Seville' and 'Marriage of Figaro' were written by whom?","output":"The plays 'The Barber of Seville' and 'Marriage of Figaro' were both written by the French playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais was born in Paris on January 24, 1732, and died on May 18, 1799. He is best known for his three Figaro plays, which revolve around the central character of Figaro. 'The Barber of Seville', originally titled 'Le Barbier de Séville', is a four-act comedy written in French. Beaumarchais completed the work in 1773, and it was first performed on February 23, 1775, at the Comédie-Française in Paris. The play revolves around the schemes of Count Almaviva, who, with the help of Figaro, attempts to win the heart and hand of the beautiful Rosine, who is under the control of her elderly guardian, Doctor Bartholo. The story is filled with comedy, wit, and romance and is regarded as a major classic of French theatre. 'The Marriage of Figaro', originally titled 'La Folle Journée, ou Le Mariage de Figaro', is a five-act comedy also written in French by Beaumarchais. Completed in 1778, it is a sequel to 'The Barber of Seville'. 'The Marriage of Figaro' was initially banned by the French monarchy due to its potentially subversive content, but it finally premiered on April 27, 1784, at the Comédie-Française. The play follows the continuing adventures of Figaro, who is now the valet of Count Almaviva. Figaro plans to marry the beautiful Suzanne, the countess's maid, but faces multiple obstacles, including the count's wandering eye and a series of comedic misunderstandings and deceptions. This play also highlights the tensions between social classes and comes to symbolize the impending French Revolution. Both 'The Barber of Seville' and 'The Marriage of Figaro' have been adapted numerous times, most notably as operas. The Italian composer Gioachino Rossini transformed 'The Barber of Seville' into an opera buffa, which premiered in Rome in 1816, while Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart adapted 'The Marriage of Figaro' into an opera buffa, which premiered in Vienna in 1786. These operatic adaptations have reached a wide audience over the centuries and continue to be popular and well-loved productions within the world of opera and classical music."},{"instruction":"Select from the following.

There he meets his boss Henry Bullard and his wife Aggie Bullard. John tries to civilize them, building schools and providing education for the Iban people. He is met with unfamiliar local customs. Selima becomes his \\"sleeping dictionary\\", who sleeps with him and teaches him the language and the habits of the locals. John is sent up river where a sickness is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans. He notices that the Yakata have rice – which has been given to them by the miners – and he guesses correctly that the miners have poisoned the rice in order to get rid of the Yakata. Knowing that they will exact vengeance, John tells the Yakata what has happened. The Yakata wipe out the miners. Despite their intents, the two find themselves falling into a forbidden love.

Article: If cars had wings, they could fly and that just might happen, beginning in 2012. The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its car-plane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012. \\"It's next 'wow' vehicle,\\" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh. \\"Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.\\" The car-plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land. The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both. The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations. The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly. They say it saves you the trouble from trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go. When you land, you hold up the wings and hit the road. There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an airport-you park it in the garage at home. The car-plane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers. Thrrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under the bad weather instead of flying into marginal  conditions. The Transition's price tag: 194,000. But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, , a transponder or a GPS. Another option is a full-plane parachute. \\"If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option.\\" Gersh said. So far, the company has more than 70 orders with deposits. \\"We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps,\\" Brown said.

The group started as a children's group in 1982 and managed to evolve successfully into adulthood. Timbiriche is considered one of the most iconic Latin Pop acts of the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was the seed of numerous figures in the Latin American entertainment world, including successful singers like Thalia, Paulina Rubio and Edith Marquez, as well as actors, composers and conductors. Without the majority of its original members, the group was in decline, but the producers decided to continue with the concept and bet on launching a new generation. Surprisingly, in the midst of production, Claudio is fired from the group.  By the end of 1991, the band returns with five new members: Lorena Shelley, Daniel Gaytan, Tannya Velasco, Kenya Hijuelos and Alexa Lozano. Together with Diego and Silvia they record the album Timbiriche XI. Kenya leaves the group before the official presentation of the disc by decision of the creators of the group by conflicts between the new members, being replaced by Jean Duverger. This second generation is officially presented during a broadcast of Siempre en domingo, in which all former members were invited to introduce the new members. This meeting was unique, since it had almost all the members of the group, being the only ones missing Diego, due to health problems and Thalia, who was working in Spain.  Despite retaining the name and concept in general, there was a new musical style that mixed dance and tropical rhythms. Although the album was not so popular with fans of the first generation, it began to appeal to younger generations, thanks to hitls like Vanidosa, Solo te quiero a ti, Tierra dorada, and Piel a piel, receiving disc of Gold and platinum by high sales. Thanks to this the group could survive another year.  For 1993 they record Timbiriche XII, disc of which it was detached like the last success of the group: Muriendo Lento (cover of Slowly original song of the ex- singer of the Swedish group ABBA, Anni-Frid Lyngstad). But at the beginning of 1994 Alexa decided to leave the group, announcing it in a concert in Monterrey to the fans without having said before to the managers and companions.

When the irregularities of the surface are much smaller than the wavelength, we are in the regime of specular reflection, and the receiver sees both the real antenna and an image of the antenna under the ground due to reflection. But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases. With shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), this is generally the case. What is the net quality of the ground dependent of? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The net quality of ground reflection is dependent on several factors, which include: 1. Surface topography: The terrain's irregularities and surface roughness play a significant role in determining the net quality of the ground reflection. When the surface irregularities are much smaller than the wavelength, specular reflection occurs, leading to an easily distinguishable reflection in the receiver's sight. However, if the ground has irregularities comparable to or larger than the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent, resulting in random phase shifts and decreased net quality. 2. Wavelength and frequency: The wavelength and frequency of the signal also have a direct impact on the net quality of ground reflection. Shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) are more susceptible to scattering and diffraction due to surface irregularities compared to longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). Therefore, at higher frequencies, the net quality is generally lower due to the increased likelihood of incoherent reflections. 3. Ground material properties: The composition and electrical properties of the ground significantly impact the net quality of ground reflection. Softer ground materials, such as soil, sand, and vegetation, tend to absorb more energy and attenuate the signal, while harder materials, such as concrete and asphalt, are better reflectors. Additionally, the ground's dielectric constant, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability also affect the reflection, absorption, and scattering of the signal.  4. Polarization and angle of incidence: The orientation and angle at which the signal impacts the ground surface will also affect the net quality of ground reflection. Signals polarized parallel to the surface tend to reflect better than those polarized perpendicular to the surface. The angle of incidence also matters, as shallow angles usually result in better reflection, while steep angles may cause the signal to penetrate deeper into the ground, increasing losses due to absorption. 5. Local environment: Factors such as the presence of buildings, trees, and other structures can also contribute to the net quality of ground reflection. These objects may cause additional reflection, diffraction, or scattering, which could interfere with the primary ground reflection and decrease the net quality. In summary, the net quality of ground reflection depends on various factors, including surface topography, wavelength and frequency, ground material properties, polarization and angle of incidence, and the local environment. Collectively, these factors determine the strength and coherence of ground-reflected signals, thereby affecting the overall net quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week.

Prepare your work surface: Lay out all the tools and materials from option (B) on a clean and flat surface. Tools: - Bottle Scoring Jig - Soldering Iron - Scissors - Double Boiler Parts: - Glass Bottle - Tea Light Candle (optional, for reference) - Wick - Wax - Crayon (for coloring) 2. Score the glass bottle: Attach the glass bottle to the bottle scoring jig and score the bottle at the desired height by rotating it against the blade. This will create a guideline for cutting the glass. 3. Heat the scoreline: Carefully use a soldering iron along the scoreline to weaken the glass. You could also use the alternative method of alternating between hot and cold water to crack the glass along the scoreline. 4. Separate the top of the bottle: Gently tap on the sides of the scoreline to separate the top of the glass bottle. You could also use soft pliers to slowly break the glass at the scoreline, being cautious not to apply too much pressure. 5. Sand the edges: Use a sanding tool to remove any sharp or jagged edges from the cut portion of the glass bottle. Ensure the edges are smooth and safe to handle. 6. Prepare the wax: Cut a crayon into small pieces and mix it with the wax. Place the mixture in the top part of the double boiler and heat it over low to medium heat until fully melted. Use scissors to cut a piece of wick long enough to reach the bottom of the glass bottle while leaving excess wick at the top to light later. 7. Attach the wick: Dip the bottom end of the wick into the melted wax and place it at the bottom center of the glass bottle. Hold the wick in place until the wax has hardened, or you can use a pencil or a clip to hold the wick in the center of the bottle. 8. Pour the wax: Carefully pour the melted wax mixture into the glass bottle, making sure to fill it about an inch (2.5 cm) from the top. Allow the wax to cool and solidify. 9. Trim the wick: Once the wax is solid, use scissors to trim the wick at an appropriate length to allow for safe and easy lighting.

However, he is spotted and held for the authorities. When they arrive, he claims that he qualifies for entry under an exception for those who helped Allied soldiers during the war, but all he knows about the paratrooper he hid from the enemy is that his name is Tom and he plays clarinet in a jazz band in New York City's Times Square.The immigration authorities led by Inspector Bailey say that without better documentation he must be sent back to Europe.

John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Locke accept that Machiavelli and Hobbes also believed?","output":"The given passage does not explicitly provide an answer to the question, \\"What did Locke accept that Machiavelli and Hobbes also believed?\\" However, it does highlight the differences between Locke and the other philosophers.

The given statement is quite vague and can be interpreted in various ways, as it doesn't provide enough elements that help us make a precise deduction. Let's break down the information provided and analyze the missing elements. 1. Number of individuals: The given statement, \\"Tall humans walking,\\" does not mention how many humans are involved. It could be two, three, or even more. The desired conclusion specifies \\"two teenage boys,\\" so we would need information about the number of individuals in the situation. 2. Age and gender of the individuals: The statement makes no reference to the age nor the gender of the individuals involved. We cannot determine whether they are teenage boys, adult women, or any other possible age and gender combination based on the given statement. 3. The act of walking together: Although we know that the tall humans are walking, we do not have any information indicating that they are walking together. They could be independently walking, walking in a group, or walking with other people not mentioned in the statement. This information is missing to conclude that the two individuals are walking together. 4. Location: The desired conclusion specifies that the walking is happening \\"down the sidewalk in a city.\\"The original statement does not provide any information about the location, so we cannot determine whether the humans are walking down a sidewalk in a city, a rural road, a park, or any other possible location. 5. Additional context: The given statement also excludes any further details about the situation, such as the time of day, the reason for walking, or any other characteristics of the individuals involved. This lack of context makes it harder to create a clear and complete understanding of the statement. In summary, the information given in the statement \\"Tall humans walking\\" is not sufficient to accurately conclude that \\"Two teenage boys are walking together down the sidewalk in a city.\\" To arrive at such a specific conclusion, we would require additional context and details that address the number of individuals, their age and gender, the act of walking together, the location, and any other relevant factors that provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scenario."},{"instruction":"Pam and Mary were two gardener friends.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farmer sprayed plants thoroughly with a strong water jet?  Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

What is the answer for the question: To whom is Millar referring when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm? from the following article ?  In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of  salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth.","output":"In the given article, Millar is referring to the painter John Michael Wright when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken between Wright and his rival Sir Peter Lely would demonstrate Wright's remarkable independence, unfailing integrity, and charm.

See options at the end The cabinets Maria chose were extremely hated by Katrina since    *Maria had complete say in the choice that was made.  *Katrina had complete say in the choice that was made.","output":"The sentence ends as follows: \\"The cabinets Maria chose were extremely hated by Katrina since Maria had complete say in the choice that was made.\\" In this case, the situation implies that Katrina was unhappy, not because she had a say in the decision-making process, but because she was entirely left out of it, leading to her dissatisfaction. To understand the whole situation better, let's dive into more details behind this narrative. Choosing cabinets is essential when remodeling or organizing a space, as they contribute significantly to the room's aesthetics and storage capacity. Therefore, when two or more people are involved in a project, they commonly want to have equal say and contributions, to ensure that the results meet both of their tastes, preferences and needs. In the given sentence, Maria was given the authority and responsibility to choose the cabinets for a space that she and Katrina both shared or needed to use. Since Maria took complete charge without Katrina's input, it led to a decision that left Katrina unhappy. This could have been a result of various factors, including differences in taste, Katrina's desire to have more storage capacity or specific functional requirements, or the chosen cabinets not fitting the overall design aesthetic that Katrina had envisioned. It is crucial to consider the input of all involved parties in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and dissatisfaction. By neglecting to do so, situations like the one described could arise, where one party feels ignored, and the resulting decision fails to meet their needs. Had the sentence ended with Katrina having complete say in the choice that was made, it would indicate that Maria disregarded her request or suggestions, resulting in a selection of cabinets that Maria would like instead of agreeing with the decision to which Katrina was entitled. However, this is not the case in the given sentence, as Maria had complete control over the decision, leading to Katrina's displeasure. The unequal contribution within the decision-making process has consequently caused feelings of dislike and resentment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He had a hard enough time getting her to say yes when he proposed. He was it.      In 1950, Gantt went missing during combat in the Korean War. He was presumed dead, but Clara Gantt, now 94, held out hope and never remarried.      On Friday morning on the Los Angeles International Airport tarmac, the widow stood from her wheelchair and cried as her husband's flag-draped casket arrived home. He was one of hundreds of U.S. soldiers whose remains have been turned over by the North Korean government in recent years.      \\"I told him I missed him so much,\\" she said softly. \\"And I expect him to come home and he didn't.\\"      Remains returned: An article in the Dec. 21 Section A about a missing soldier's remains being returned to his widow nearly 63 years after his death said the North Korean government returned the remains to the U.S. The remains of Army Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Gantt were turned over by a South Korean citizen. —      He never saw the house in Inglewood, just a few miles from where she greeted his remains. He hated yardwork, and never wanted the hassle of owning a home. She bought him one anyway and hired a gardener so he could do whatever he pleased when he came home to her.      A wall of her bedroom is covered with military certificates and photos — his barracks, him in front of a white picket fence during World War II, his father. A copy of her picture — the one he always kept with him — stands nearby. A teddy bear in army fatigues sits in her living room, near an American flag with his photo tucked into the glass display.      She's afraid to hang his medals, which include the Bronze Star with Valor, awarded posthumously, and a Purple Heart, for fear they'd be stolen during one of many break-ins that have happened on the street where she's lived since the 1960s. She would rather they be safe in a museum.      Gantt said she never stopped waiting for word, but she forged ahead with her own life. She worked for years as a caregiver for people with disabilities, as well as children. She and her husband had always wanted to have kids, and working with them gave her pleasure.      \\"I would just pray and ask the Lord to let me live until they find a closure for him so I can be here to put him away myself,\\" she said, wearing a dog tag with his photo printed on it given to her at the morning ceremony.      ::      Joseph Gantt joined the Army in 1942 and served in the South Pacific during WWII. Clara was one of 18 children who grew up on a farm in Texas. She tired of being at home, she said, so in her 20s she used the money she saved working in a cafeteria to take a train to California. It was on the train the two met in 1946, when Joseph beat his fellow soldiers to speaking to the woman who would two years later become his wife.      They were sweethearts for a long time because she refused to marry him — she feared he might already have a wife. She wrote \\"Uncle Sam\\" to get the truth, and finally agreed when the answer she was looking for came along.      They lived in Fort Lewis, Washington until he left for the Korean War, assigned as a field medic, Battery C, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division.      In December 1950, she received a letter from him and 100 for Christmas. That month, he was taken prisoner defending his unit's position near Kunu-ri' Korea. He died in March 1951, officials later discovered.      Over the years, she's been to dozens of meetings in Washington, D.C., meant to update the wives and family members of veterans. Some 84,000 service members, including 8,000 from the Korean War, are still missing.      Her family has told her she's crazy to attend the meetings after so long, but he was her husband, she said. She'd keep going even if she was in a wheelchair.      When she got a call asking if she would be in Washington for the October meeting, she knew what was coming. She flew there, alone, and was told her husband's remains had been found.      Then they read the letter she wrote the government so many years ago, inquiring about his marital status.      In recent years, the remains were finally returned to the U.S. by North Korea, then sent to a forensics lab in Honolulu to be identified, said Bob Kurkjian, executive director of USO Greater Los Angeles Area.      ::      During the last 63 years, no one else caught Clara Gantt's fancy as she waited for news of her husband. She told the base officials assigned to check wives' homes for other men to come by anytime, they'd never catch her with anyone.      \\"I am very, very proud of him. He was a wonderful husband, an understanding man,\\" she told reporters at the airport. \\"I always did love my husband, we was two of one kind, we loved each other. And that made our marriage complete.\\"      Joseph Gantt will be buried in Inglewood later this month. One day, she'll be buried alongside him.      samantha.schaefer@latimes.com      Times staff writer Christine Mai-Duc contributed to this report. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — Army Sgt. 1st Class Joseph E. Gantt went off to war 63 years ago, leaving behind a wife who never gave up on his return.      On Friday, 94-year-old Clara Gantt stood up from her wheelchair and wept in the cold before the flag-draped casket.      Sgt. Gantt was finally home.      \\"He told me if anything happened to him he wanted me to remarry. I told him no, no. Here I am, still his wife,\\" she told reporters at Los Angeles International Airport, where his remains were carried from a jetliner by military honor guard.      Gant was a field medic who went missing in action on Nov. 30, 1950 during the Korean War while serving with Battery C, 503rd Field Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division, according to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office in Washington, D.C.      According to the office, elements of the 2nd Infantry Division were attacked by greater numbers of Chinese forces near the town of Kunu-ri, North Korea. The division disengaged and withdrew, fighting its way through a series of Chinese roadblocks. Numerous U.S. soldiers were reported missing that day in the vicinity of Somindong, North Korea.      After a 1953 exchange of prisoners of war, returning U.S. soldiers reported that Gantt had been injured in battle, captured by Chinese forces and died in a POW camp in early 1951 from malnutrition and lack of medical care. His remains were only recently identified. Information on when they were found was not immediately available from the missing personnel office.      Nearly 7,900 Americans are still unaccounted for from the Korean War. According to the Defense Department, modern technology allows identifications to continue to be made from remains turned over by North Korea or recovered from that nation by American teams.      \\"Sixty-some odd years and just receiving his remains, coming home, was a blessing and I am so happy that I was living to accept him,\\" Clara Gantt said.      She met her future husband in 1946 while on a train heading to California. Two years later, they were married.      She lives a few miles away from the airport in Inglewood. She bought the home in the 1960s to await her husband's return and even hired a gardener because he hated yardwork, she told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1dYMORj)      One wall of her bedroom is covered with photos of military certificates and photos but Gantt said she hasn't displayed his posthumously awarded Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor for fear they would be stolen; there have been many break-ins over the years in her neighborhood.      Over the years she worked as a caregiver for the disabled and children. But she never was tempted to marry.      \\"I am very, very proud of him. He was a wonderful husband, an understanding man,\\" she told reporters. \\"I always did love my husband, we was two of one kind, we loved each other. And that made our marriage complete.\\"      Joseph Gantt is to be buried with full military honors is scheduled for Dec. 28 in Inglewood, Calif.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

Answer the following question: Q: Amines are weak bases due to the presence of a lone pair of what on the nitrogen atom?   A: Available choices: + protons + nuclei + atoms + electrons Answer:","output":"A: Amines are weak bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.  Step 1: Understand the question - The question is asking about the reason why amines are weak bases and the presence of a specific feature on the nitrogen atom. Step 2: Identify the relevant concept - Amines are organic compounds in which nitrogen is bonded to a carbon or hydrogen atom. They have a lone pair on the nitrogen atom. Step 3: Recall the basic chemistry definitions - A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of atoms. Nuclei are the central region of atoms containing protons and neutrons. Atoms are the smallest unit of matter comprising protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles surrounding the nucleus of atoms. Step 4: Analyze the available choices: - Protons: Amines do contain nitrogen, which has protons in its nucleus, but the presence of protons is not a unique feature of nitrogen that contributes to its basicity. - Nuclei: While the nitrogen nucleus is part of the amine, it doesn't directly explain the molecule's weak base nature. - Atoms: This option is too general and doesn't address the specific feature responsible for the basicity of amines. - Electrons: The nitrogen atom in amines indeed has a lone pair of electrons that can accept protons, which makes amines weak bases. Step 5: Select the correct answer - Based on the analysis, I can conclude that electrons are the correct answer because they are the source of the lone pair responsible for the weak basic nature of amines."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Kabul - A month out from the polls, the three frontrunners in Afghanistan’s presidential election have debated their policies on the future of the nation’s foreign relations. Tuesday’s debate, aired live on Tolo TV, saw Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, Doctor Abdullah Abdullah and Doctor Zalmai Rassoul discuss the impact of foreign relations on security, aid and the economy. Moderator Mujahid Kakkar first asked the candidates if they accepted the Durand Line, the disputed 2,640km border separating Afghanistan from Pakistan. Rassoul said the validity of the border — established by an 1893 memorandum of understanding — was not up to a single government to determine. Instead, its status must be addressed through consultation with the Afghan people. Abdullah agreed, saying any decision on the Durand Line must come from the people and parliament. Ahmadzai, however, said while Pakistan “does not and will not have the right to interfere in Afghanistan”, insecurity and insurgency, not the disputed border, were the nation’s first priority. Afghans, including the three leading candidates, have repeatedly accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for the armed opposition. “Pakistan is using the Afghan Taliban to reach its foreign policy goals,\\" said Abdullah. With regard to Afghanistan’s relations with the West and its role in foreign aid, all three candidates said they supported the Bilateral Security Agreement, which would stipulate guidelines for US forces remaining beyond the planned December international troop withdrawal or its alternative, a so-called \\"zero option\\". In November, President Hamid Karzai shocked many at home and abroad after he refused to sign the BSA without securing specific assurances from Washington. Karzai’s demands that the US made serious efforts to support peace talks with the armed opposition and guarantee that they would not interfere with the April 5 ballot came after a Loya Jirga, grand assembly, unanimously approved the pact. During the debate, the most direct support for the pact came from Ahmadzai, one of the agreement's lead negotiators, who said he would sign the BSA in his “first week in office\\". Both he and Rassoul said a zero option was unlikely, with Rassoul describing a complete US withdrawal as \\"near impossible\\". Washington had invested too much, both militarily and financially, in Afghanistan for it to be likely, he said. Abdullah, however, who came second to Karzai in the 2009 ballot, said the incumbent's “unbalanced and emotional” actions only increased the likelihood of a zero option. “The implementation of a zero option is increasing with each passing day,\\" said Abdullah. Karzai’s foreign policyAbdullah also accused Karzai of making “personal and emotional” decisions which had not only hurt the nation’s standing in the world but also hindered relations with potential partner nations. Ahmadzai, who headed the committee overseeing the transition to Afghan-led security, singled out Karzai’s relations with Islamabad. “Hamid Karzai has made many visits to Pakistan but without results,” he said. All three candidates said efforts must be made to strengthen Afghanistan’s ties with potential foreign partners, including Western states. Ahmadzai said it would be impossible for Afghanistan, in its current economic state, to continue to support its 350,000-strong security forces without Western help. “It is not possible to meet our current security expense without the help of the West.” Ahmadzai said Afghanistan must look for help from all possible sources, including regional neighbours China and India. Abdullah however, said regional support was not \\"a reasonable substitute for Western aid”. Describing Western relations as in a “delicate” state, Abdullah said increased diplomacy would be required to attract foreign aid beyond 2014. Rassoul, however, took a more positive stance on Kabul’s diplomacy. “Next to freedom of speech, our largest achievement has been improvements in our relations with the rest of the world.” With Karzai constitutionally barred from seeking a third term, the April 5 poll will mark the first peaceful, democratic transition of power in Afghanistan.

Mike sneezes around flowers, but is just fine around perfumes, so he must have an allergy to the","output":"pollen produced by the flowers rather than the fragrance itself. To confirm this theory, let's consider the following steps: Step 1: Understand the differences between pollen and perfume Given that Mike is fine around perfumes but not around flowers, it's crucial to recognize the difference between pollen and perfume. Pollen is a fine powdery substance released by flowers, which is the primary cause of allergies in many people. Perfume, on the other hand, is a mixture of fragrant essential oils and aroma compounds that mimic the scent of flowers. Step 2: Rule out other causes Before concluding that Mike has an allergy to pollen, we should also rule out other potential causes of his sneezing. For example, he might be allergic to certain trees, grasses, or even an unrelated factor present in the environment where flowers are usually found. Step 3: Observe his reaction around non-floral perfumes We should also examine Mike's reactions to perfumes with scents other than flowers. This can help us rule out the possibility that Mike is fine with only specific types of fragrances instead of a broader immunity to all perfumes. Step 4: Consult with an allergist The most effective way to determine if Mike is indeed allergic to pollen is to consult an allergist who can perform tests and analyze his symptoms. Step 5: Take preventive measures If it is confirmed that Mike has a pollen allergy, he should avoid areas with a high concentration of flowers, especially during the pollen season. Utilizing air purifiers and wearing masks when necessary can also help in reducing the symptoms. In conclusion, the fact that Mike sneezes around flowers but not perfumes leads us to believe that he has an allergy to the pollen rather than the scent of the flowers. By following these steps, we can further investigate and confirm the cause of his allergy and take necessary actions to minimize his symptoms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At that time, producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program, with built-in safeguards to protect their investments. With the passage of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act of 1966, the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton.

As a frequent shopper for personal care products, Natalie knew that choosing the best option for her had to be the one that also took into account the environmental impact. It was important for her to find a balance between maintaining her luscious locks and preserving the environment. Thus, she opted for the natural shampoo over the discounted conditioner. The shampoo was made by a small, family-owned company that took great pride in using natural ingredients – most of which were locally sourced. It did not contain any harsh chemical preservatives or synthetic fragrances, which usually pollute the air and water when they make their way down the drain during showering. Moreover, this family-owned business was committed to environmental sustainability, and all their packaging was made from recyclable materials. Natalie appreciated the company’s transparency, as they clearly stated their dedication to using organic and sustainably-sourced ingredients on the label. This included essential oils derived from plants grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or herbicides. There was a detailed list of all the components, and a thorough explanation of their benefits not only for the hair but also for the earth. In comparison, the discounted conditioner seemed like an appealing deal because of its lower price. However, upon closer inspection, Natalie noticed that the ingredient list was filled with an assortment of unpronounceable names and numbers, indicating an array of synthetic chemicals. Studies have shown that such ingredients can be harmful to aquatic wildlife when they get washed down the drain and end up in streams, rivers, and eventually the ocean. Besides, the manufacturer of the conditioner did not provide any information on their environmental impact or sustainability efforts. Furthermore, the conditioner's packaging was made from non-recyclable plastic, which contributes to the ever-growing plastic pollution problem. Natalie imagined that if she were to choose this product, the empty bottles might end up in a landfill or even worse, harm marine life in the oceans. Feeling confident in her decision, Natalie placed the natural shampoo in her cart and proceeded to the checkout counter. On her way out, she couldn't help but marvel at the growing number of eco-friendly products filling the store shelves. It was evident that she was not alone in her desire to make conscious choices. Upon using the shampoo for the first time, Natalie was delighted with the results. Her hair felt clean, refreshed, and revitalized, without any of the greasiness or residue that she sometimes experienced with her previous, cheaper shampoos. It had a delightful scent, thanks to the natural essential oils, that lingered in her hair even after she had rinsed it off. She happily shared her environmentally-conscious find with her friends and family, who were so impressed that some even began reevaluating their own personal care choices. Natalie furthered her commitment by researching and supporting other sustainable businesses and products, gradually transforming her everyday habits and decisions to contribute positively to the environment. By choosing the natural shampoo, Natalie started a ripple effect that not only benefited her own health and well-being but also inspired positive change within her circle and, eventually, her community.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Maya Angelou, writer and poet, dies at age 86 Maya Angelou, a child of the Jim Crow South who rose to international prominence as a writer known for her frank chronicles of personal history and a performer instantly identified by her regal presence and rich, honeyed voice, died May 28 at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C. She was 86. Her literary agent, Helen Brann, confirmed the death but said she did not know the cause. Ms. Angelou had heart ailments and had been in declining health for years. She established her literary reputation in 1970 with “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” a memoir detailing the racism and abuse she endured during her harrowing childhood. From her desperate early years, Ms. Angelou gradually moved into nightclub dancing and from there began a career in the arts that spanned more than 60 years. She sang cabaret and calypso, danced with Alvin Ailey, acted on Broadway, directed for film and television and wrote more than 30 books, including poetry, essays and, responding to the public's appetite for her life story, six autobiographies. She won three Grammy Awards for spoken-word recordings of her poetry and prose and was invited by President-elect Bill Clinton to read an original poem at his first inauguration in 1993, making her the second poet, after Robert Frost, to be so honored. The poem she read, “On the Pulse of Morning,” spoke of a hope that the country's diverse people would find new unity after chapters in U.S. history of oppression and division. “Lift up your eyes upon /The day breaking for you,” she said as the nation watched. “Give birth again /To the dream.” In 2011, President Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. In a statement Wednesday, Obama described Ms. Angelou as “a truly phenomenal woman” and his sister Maya’s namesake. “A childhood of suffering and abuse actually drove her to stop speaking – but the voice she found helped generations of Americans find their rainbow amidst the clouds, and inspired the rest of us to be our best selves,” Obama said. It was her story of personal transformation in “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” that launched Ms. Angelou's career and brought her wide recognition as a symbol of strength overcoming struggle. “She brought an understanding of the dilemmas and dangers and exhilarations of black womanhood more to the fore than almost any autobiographer before her time,” said Arnold Rampersad, a literary critic and professor emeritus of English at Stanford University. “She challenged assumptions about what was possible for a poor black girl from the South, and she emerged as a figure of courage, honesty and grace.” The idea for “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” arose during conversations with friends, including James Baldwin, whom she met in Paris. Ms. Angelou initially resisted the suggestion that she write her story, giving in only after an editor goaded her by suggesting that writing autobiography as literature was too difficult for anyone to do well. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” focused on growing up in her grandmother’s care in segregated Stamps, Ark., and on her rape by her mother’s boyfriend at age 7, “a breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart.” Poet Maya Angelou reads \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration. After she spoke her attacker’s name, he was found kicked to death in a lot behind a slaughterhouse. Convinced that her voice had the power to kill, she fell nearly silent for nearly five years. She spoke only to her beloved older brother, Bailey. “I had to stop talking,” she wrote. “I walked into rooms where people were laughing, their voices hitting the walls like stones, and I simply stood still — in the midst of a riot of sound. After a minute or two, silence would rush into the room from its hiding place because I had eaten up all the sounds.” The book, which came at the leading edge of a renaissance in literature by black female writers such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, traces the young Ms. Angelou’s effort to recover her voice and a sense of control over her body and her life, beginning with her recitation of “A Tale of Two Cities” at the behest of a family friend. Enduringly popular, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” has been translated into 17 languages, sold more than 1 million copies and still appears on high school and college reading lists. “There isn’t any easy, which is to say false line in the book,” wrote the novelist Ward Just in a Washington Post review. “It is not propaganda nor a history of the blacks, nor, most blessedly, sociology. It is one woman, Maya Angelou, writing about her life and times and writing from a talent so strong as to make each part of it immediate, direct, devastating and — oddly — beautiful.” Ms. Angelou produced five subsequent autobiographical volumes, avoiding distractions during her writing days by retreating to hotel rooms, where she removed art from the walls. She often arrived before dawn — dictionary, thesaurus and bottle of dry sherry in tow — and wrote longhand on yellow legal pads. None of her poetry or prose brought the same acclaim as “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” but critics praised her ability to weave street talk with literary references and the rhythm of church hymns. But in some sense, Ms. Angelou existed in a realm untouched by criticism. She developed a devoted group of readers who adored her and were drawn to her poems, which featured accessible rhymes and themes of cultivating love, conquering injustice and speaking out of silence. “You may write me down in history /With your bitter, twisted lies,” reads a poem in her 1978 collection, “And Still I Rise.” “You may trod me in the very dirt /But still, like dust, I’ll rise.” In 2002, she lent her name and verse to a line of Hallmark greeting cards, table runners and other products. “I want my work read,” she told The Post at the time. Her ability to reach a mass audience, including people who did not consider themselves poetry readers, set her apart. A fixture on the lecture circuit and a popular guest on Oprah Winfrey’s talk show, her personal story became a platform for her message of renewal and hope. “If God put the rainbows right in the clouds themselves, each one of us in the direst and dullest and most dreaded and dreary moments can see a possibility of hope,” she said in a speech at a conference at Weber State University in Utah in 1997. “Each one of us has the chance to be a rainbow in somebody’s cloud.” Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Ann Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis to Bailey Johnson, a dietitian, and Vivian Johnson, a card dealer and boardinghouse proprietor. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and they sent her to Arkansas with her brother Bailey — “the greatest person in my world,” she wrote, who called her “My,” “Mine,” and finally “Maya.” In 1940, she and Bailey moved to California to live with their mother. Ms. Angelou, who had discovered Shakespeare (“my first white love”) as a child in Stamps, graduated from Mission High School in San Francisco and took evening drama and dance classes. Concerned she might be a lesbian and wanting to prove she was “normal,” she propositioned a young man who lived up the street. After that one encounter, she became pregnant at age 16 with Clyde “Guy” Johnson, her only child. In addition to her son, survivors include two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She spent the next several years bouncing between jobs, scraping by first as a streetcar conductor and cook who read the Russians — Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov — in her free time. She said she also fell in love with a man who worked as a pimp, which led her to prostitution and then a stint as a madam. She tried to join the Women’s Army Corps but was rejected because the California Labor School, where she had taken dance classes, appeared on the House Un-American Activities Committee list of organizations with communist sympathies. Ever more desperate, she sold stolen clothes and flirted with drugs until a friend who was a heroin addict forced her to watch him shoot up. “He slouched, nodding, his mouth open and the saliva sliding down his chin as slowly as the blood had flowed down his arm,” she wrote in “Gather Together in My Name” (1974), the second volume of her autobiography. It was a turning point — the underworld revealed. “I had walked the precipice and seen it all; and at the critical moment, one man’s generosity pushed me safely away from the edge.” In the early 1950s, she married Tosh Angelos, a Greek American sailor. They divorced several years later, but it was during their marriage that she landed a dancing and singing gig at San Francisco’s famed Purple Onion nightclub and first used the name Angelou — a version of Angelos. In the mid-1950s, she toured 22 countries in Europe and Africa with a State Department production of the Gershwin folk opera “Porgy and Bess,” acted off-Broadway and released her first album of songs, “Miss Calypso.” She chronicled this blossoming of her performance career in “Singin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas” (1976), the third volume of her autobiography. Ms. Angelou’s interest in writing grew from song lyrics to short stories, and, with the encouragement of John Oliver Killens, a friend and black novelist, she moved to New York City in 1959 to join the Harlem Writers Guild. Members of the Guild critiqued her writing and offered advice: “Write each sentence over and over again,” she recalled in “The Heart of a Woman” (1981) the fourth installment of her autobiography, “until it seems you’ve used every combination possible, then write it again.” In New York, Ms. Angelou was exposed to civil rights leaders, among them Bayard Rustin of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She helped organize and performed in the “Cabaret for Freedom,” an off-Broadway musical revenue and benefit for that organization, and performed in Jean Genet’s “The Blacks,” also off-Broadway, about everyday confrontations between whites and blacks. In 1960, Ms. Angelou replaced Rustin as the northern coordinator for the conference. She married a South African civil rights activist, Vusumzi Make, and they moved to Cairo, where she worked as an editor at an English-language newsweekly. The couple divorced soon after, but Ms. Angelou stayed in Africa with her son, working as a teacher and writer in Ghana. The West African country had won its independence from England five years earlier, in 1957, and its Pan-Africanist president, Kwame Nkrumah, invited African Americans to move there. Ms. Angelou became part of a group of black intellectuals who answered that call. “We knew that we were mostly unwanted in the land of our birth and saw promise on our ancestral continent,” she wrote in “All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes” (1986), her fifth autobiography. Soon after returning to California in 1966, she wrote “Black, Blues, Black,” a 10-part television series about the role of African culture in the United States, and served as a lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles. She chronicled this period, including the assassinations of King and Malcolm X, in “A Song Flung Up to Heaven” (2002), her final installment of her memoir and one that comes full circle, ending as a younger Ms. Angelou sits down to write the first lines of “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.” After the critical and commercial success of “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” Ms. Angelou published her first volume of poetry, “Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’fore I Diiie,” in 1971. The following year, she wrote the screenplay for the film “Georgia, Georgia,” about a black woman (played by Diana Sands) murdered for taking a white photographer as a lover. In 1973, Ms. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a carpenter, and they lived together in Berkeley, Calif., until their divorce eight years later. “I have lost good men — or men I might have been able to turn into good men — because I have no middle passage,” she told People in 1982. “I know that I’m not the easiest person to live with.” Du Feu was remodeling homes while Ms. Angelou wrote, directed for film and television, and acted. She was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway performance in “Look Away” (1973), a two-woman play about the friendship between first lady Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Geraldine Page) and Ms. Angelou’s character, Elizabeth Keckley. In the TV series “Roots” (1977), she played Kunta Kinte’s grandmother. In 1981, Ms. Angelou was appointed a lifetime member of the faculty at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. She continued to write, and her works included cookbooks and children’s books. In her many public speaking obligations, often at college commencements, she presented herself as a wise elder whose life was evidence of how far it is possible to travel. “See me now, black, female, American and Southern,” she said in a 1990 speech to students at Centenary College in Louisiana. “See me and see yourselves.

As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards.

Question:   If Mona owns a greenhouse and she decides to cover the top up to restrict sunlight, what happens to her plant's ability to make food increases or decreases?    Paragraph :  Less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food. A:","output":"If Mona owns a greenhouse and decides to cover the top to restrict sunlight, her plants' ability to make food would decrease. The paragraph states that \\"less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food.\\" Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (food) and oxygen. This process is essential for the growth and health of plants. By restricting sunlight in her greenhouse, Mona is effectively reducing the amount of light available for photosynthesis. As a result, her plants will have a harder time producing the glucose they need to grow and maintain their health. A decrease in photosynthesis ultimately leads to a decline in food production for the plants. In a greenhouse, plants are already experiencing controlled conditions such as temperature and humidity, which can help them grow more efficiently. However, sunlight is still a crucial factor for their growth and overall health. If Mona wants to maintain a healthy greenhouse and ensure her plants continue to grow and produce food, she should reconsider her decision to cover the top of her greenhouse in a way that might restrict sunlight. Instead, she could explore alternative methods to manage her plants' sunlight exposure, like adjusting the shading or using light-reflective surfaces within the greenhouse to optimize the distribution of available sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"sugar causes food to taste sweet\\" and \\"for example, traditional wisdom warns that eating sweet foods causes diabetes\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Pick your answer from: +Glucose. +Energy.. +diabetes. +Rise. +Pollution. +symptoms. +Dehydration. +heat energy. Answer:","output":"Based on the hints given by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Sugar causes\\" would be \\"+diabetes.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the most appropriate answer choice: Firstly, the teacher mentioned that \\"sugar causes food to taste sweet,\\" which indicates that the answer should be related to the effects of sugar on the body. Among the given answer choices, \\"+Glucose,\\" \\"+Energy,\\" and \\"+diabetes\\" seem to be the most relevant to this context.  Now, let's examine the second hint provided by the teacher: \\"For example, traditional wisdom warns that eating sweet foods causes diabetes.\\" This statement is more specific and clearly points out a connection between sugar and diabetes. It's important to note that the teacher is referring to \\"traditional wisdom,\\" which suggests that this is a commonly held belief rather than a scientifically proven fact. However, it still reinforces the notion that there's a relationship between sugar and diabetes. Looking back at the relevant answer choices, we can rule out \\"+Glucose\\" because it's a component of sugar and not a direct effect or consequence of consuming sugar. Similarly, we can eliminate \\"+Energy\\" because consuming sugar does provide the body with energy, but this isn't explicitly mentioned in the teacher's hints. That leaves us with \\"+diabetes\\" as the best answer choice. While it's true that research has shown that excessive sugar intake can contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes, it's essential to be aware that eating sugar in moderation does not automatically lead to diabetes. Other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and overall diet, also play a significant role in determining an individual's risk for developing diabetes. In conclusion, based on the hints provided by the teacher, it's most suitable to select \\"+diabetes\\" as the answer to the question \\"Sugar causes.\\" However, it's important to remember that sugar doesn't inherently \\"cause\\" diabetes, but rather, excessive sugar consumption can be a contributing factor in its development when combined with other risk factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to German: The only worry being that February is the rainiest month of the year in Vancouver. German:","output":"Der einzige Grund zur Sorge ist, dass der Februar der regenreichste Monat des Jahres in Vancouver ist. Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. The only worry -> Der einzige Grund zur Sorge    I translated the phrase \\"The only worry\\" into \\"Der einzige Grund zur Sorge\\", which has the same meaning in German. I used \\"zur Sorge\\" which means \\"for concern/worry\\" and \\"Grund\\" which means \\"reason\\". This phrase is common to express an isolated concern in German.    2. being -> ist    I translated \\"being\\" into \\"ist\\", which is the third person singular present form of the verb \\"sein\\" (to be) in German. In this case the verb \\"being\\" links the subject \\"the only worry\\" with the complement \\"that February is the rainiest month of the year in Vancouver\\". 3. that -> dass    I translated the conjunction \\"that\\" into \\"dass\\" in German, which links the main clause and subordinate clause in the sentence. 4. February -> der Februar    I translated \\"February\\" into \\"der Februar\\", which is the German term for the month of February. I also added the definite article \\"der\\" because months take the definite article in German. 5. is the rainiest month -> ist der regenreichste Monat    I translated \\"is the rainiest month\\" into \\"ist der regenreichste Monat\\". The superlative of \\"rainy\\" in German is \\"regenreichste\\", which is derived by combining \\"regen\\" (rain) with \\"reich\\" (rich) and adding the superlative ending \\"-ste\\". The noun \\"month\\" is translated as \\"Monat\\" in German, and I added the definite article \\"der\\". 6. of the year -> des Jahres    I translated \\"of the year\\" into \\"des Jahres\\", which indicates the relationship between the year and the rainiest month. In German, the genitive construction \\"des Jahres\\" is used to express the meaning \\"of the year\\".

Fox News viewers less informed about current events than those who don’t watch news at all, study finds If Fox News viewers want to be informed about current events, they might as well turn off the TV. A poll released by Fairleigh Dickinson University on Monday found that people who get their news from Fox News know significantly less about news both in the U.S. and the world than people who watch no news at all. In a survey of 612 New Jersey natives, Fox News fans flunked questions about Egypt and Syria when compared with people who don't watch the news. Fox viewers were 18-points less likely to know that Egyptians toppled their government and 6 points less likely to be aware that Syrians have not yet overthrown theirs. \\"Because of the controls for partisanship, we know these results are not just driven by Republicans or other groups being more likely to watch Fox News,\\" Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson professor who served as an analyst for the poll, said in the report. \\"Rather, the results show us that there is something about watching Fox News that leads people to do worse on these questions that those who don't watch any news at all.\\" Those surveyed also struggled with current events closer to home. Just 47% were able to identify the Occupy Wall Street protesters as predominantly Democratic, while 11% thought they were Republican. Here it was MSNBC viewers who got it wrong the most - watching the left-leaning network was linked to a 10-point increase in the likelihood of misidentifying the demonstrators. MSNBC viewers did have a 10-point higher chance, however, of correctly identifying Mitt Romney as a frontrunner in the race for a 2012 GOP nominee. Fox News viewers didn't benefit -- or suffer -- in this category, a fact Cassino called \\"very surprising\\" given the amount of attention the network has paid to the candidates. The most informative outlets were found to be the Sunday morning news shows as well as outlets like the New York Times, USA today and NPR. Another powerful source of news was the \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\\" Stewart's viewers had a 12-point higher likelihood of correctly identifying the Wall Street protesters, for example. \\"Jon Stewart has not spent a lot of time on some of these issues,\\" Cassino said. \\"But the results show that when he does talk about something, his viewers pick up a lot more information than they would from other news sources.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A study conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that Fox News viewers are less informed about current events than those who do not watch any news at all.

Lovers - The primary subject of the sentence, emphasizing the romantic connection between two people. When we think of lovers, we often think of intimacy, passion, and the closeness a couple shares. 2. Cuddling - This verb illustrates the physical affection the lovers are sharing in the moment. It paints a picture of warmth, comfort, and a feeling of safety between the couple. 3. Tree - A central element in the scene, as the tree is where the lovers have chosen to nestle together. The tree suggests a sense of nature, tranquility, and perhaps even an element of adventure or playfulness as they climb up or find a spot to cuddle within its branches. 4. Shore - This word indicates the geographical location of the scene, which is on the edge of a body of water. Shores often evoke feelings of relaxation, natural beauty, and a calming atmosphere where people can connect more deeply with each other and their surroundings. 5. Lake - The body of water itself completes the image of this serene and picturesque setting.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007, it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick. Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts. First of all: the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that's totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes, couldn't they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf (or at least, that's what I make of it) and then he's being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight!) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it's beyond me why they're out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? (a volunteering soldier maybe??). And why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor Aaron, isn't that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1, and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around. Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls?!? And that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red (life-) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat (can a wolf even DO that??!). The acting (or the lack thereof) didn't help the credibility of all this either: everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression (vexed) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her (but hey, there probably had to be at least one love-scene!). I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they didn't give him much to go with. He has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His (few) killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern sci-fi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more!  In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goings-on, a lot of overlong National Geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes (who cares?!?), some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments.

As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home.

This can be great if you're a nervous traveler, or if you haven't traveled by yourself before.If you're in a country where you don't speak the language, sometimes there's nothing better than getting into a taxi and opening up a guidebook.You simply point to a map that directs the taxi driver to a hostel that's cheap and clean, with friendly staff and cold beer. But others criticize Lonely Planet and other travel guide publishers like them.They say guidebooks take the fun and spontaneity   out of traveling, and that part of the enjoyment of travel comes from the fact that anything can happen.They also regret that if you follow a guidebook, you'll end up doing the same thing and having the same experience as everyone else.You might end up seeing the same group of people over and over, because everyone is reading the same book and following the same route. Another criticism of travel guides is that they have a large impact on local communities.For example, some locals devote their lives to behaving in ways that attract tourists.They pretend to live a traditional lifestyle, wear traditional clothes and live in traditional houses in order to attract the tourist dollar.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The...

A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus II, with the intent to jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they pass Mercury's orbit, Icarus II discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to several shield panels. Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by Pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the sun. The angle however allows the sun to destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety and repairs the last panel, moments before he's immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him. Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, and now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus I's mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind.

A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin.

In the mean time Nina had told the story of her love to her father, and the effect on Balatka had simply been that he had not got out of his bed since. For himself he would have cared, perhaps, but little as to the Jewish marriage, had he not known that those belonging to him would have cared so much. He had no strong religious prejudice of his own, nor indeed had he strong feeling of any kind. He loved his daughter, and wished her well; but even for her he had been unable to exert himself in his younger days, and now simply expected from her hands all the comfort which remained to him in this world. The priest he knew would attack him, and to the priest he would be able to make no answer. But to Trendellsohn, Jew as he was, he would trust in worldly matters, rather than to the Zamenoys; and were it not that he feared the Zamenoys, and could not escape from his close connection with them, he would have been half inclined to let the girl marry the Jew. Souchey, indeed, had frightened him on the subject when it had first been mentioned to him; and Nina, coming with her own assurance so quickly after Souchey's suspicion, had upset him; but his feeling in regard to Nina had none of that bitter anger, no touch of that abhorrence which animated the breast of his sister-in-law. When Ziska came to him he was alone in his bedroom.

A loner and introvert by nature, Don refuses to socialize with the colorful and quirky locals. One day, Don receives a pink letter – an oddity in a sea of white envelopes. Intrigued by the mysterious sender, he opens the letter to find an invitation to a masquerade ball at the enigmatic, historic mansion that overlooks the town. Against his instincts, Don decides to attend the ball, hoping he might find some inspiration to fuel his writing. Upon arrival, he discovers that the theme of the ball is \\"Color Your Destiny\\" and party-goers are dressed in various colors, each representing a unique personality trait. However, Don shows up in an all-black outfit with only the pink letter in hand. Throughout the night, he encounters various eccentric characters, each one subtly urging him to reveal the reason behind his attendance and what the pink letter symbolizes. Don finds himself drawn to a woman in a beautiful pink gown, but she always seems to vanish into the crowd just as he's about to approach her. As the night progresses, Don begins to uncover hidden clues that point to a secret buried deep within the town's history. The mansion's owner, a skilled painter, had his heart shattered and ultimately took his own life after being betrayed by his lover. It was rumored that before his death, he had painted a message that would lead to hidden treasure, and the key to uncovering it was through his paintings of letters – the last of which was the pink letter that mysteriously arrived in Don's mailbox. Driven by curiosity and enamored by the woman in pink, Don dives deep into the town's past and unravels the truth behind the painter's tragic demise. Through his investigation, he searches for the origin of the enigmatic pink letter. Along the way, he finds that the true message is not about material treasure, but the realization that love and hope can heal even the most broken souls. In the climactic scene, as the clock strikes midnight, Don finally comes face-to-face with the woman in pink. She reveals that she is a descendant of the painter and has been searching for the truth all her life. The pink letter was sent by her to draw Don into her journey, as she had read his previous books and knew that together they would solve the mystery. United by their shared purpose, they confess their feelings for each other and decide to embark on a new journey - together, hand in hand. And so, the once-reclusive Don finds love, inspiration, and a sense of belonging within the close-knit town that he once shunned, all thanks to the enigma of the pink letter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Ricketts Glen State Park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. Luzerne County was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County, and Fairmount Township, where the waterfalls are, was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834. About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \\"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\\", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.The Ricketts family began acquiring land in and around what became the park in 1851, when Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) on North Mountain around what is now known as Ganoga Lake.

Courcey Answer:","output":"Title: The Unbreakable Bond Genre: War / Drama / Action Plot Summary: Set during World War II, the story revolves around Courcey, a fearless, yet compassionate, British soldier who defies all odds to save his wounded comrades. As the troops face the harsh realities of war and uncertainty, Courcey's inner strength illuminates the importance of loyalty, friendship, and the power of the human spirit. Act 1: The Brotherhood Forms The film begins with a series of brief scenes establishing the main characters who are a diverse group of British soldiers. We're introduced to Courcey, a charismatic and skilled sergeant with a genuine care for his fellow soldiers. As the men begin their training, Courcey quickly earns the respect of his comrades through his leadership and acts of kindness. During a night-time raid exercise, a young soldier named Aiden injures his leg after stepping into a concealed hole. Despite facing criticism for slowing down the team, Courcey insists on carrying Aiden over his shoulder for the remainder of the exercise. This act of courage and loyalty cements Courcey as the cornerstone of the unit. Act 2: The War Rages On As World War II intensifies, the soldiers are deployed to the European frontlines. The men encounter several life-threatening battles and their camaraderie is pushed to the limit as they face life and death decisions on a daily basis. Throughout the chaos, Courcey's unwavering commitment to not leave behind any wounded soldiers becomes legendary. At the climax of a particularly brutal battle, a member of the unit, Steve, is critically injured by a nearby explosion. He falls into a shell hole, completely exposed to enemy fire. Courcey, knowing the risks, rushes to Steve's aid and manages to bring him back to cover despite taking fire from the enemy. Act 3: The Final Battle The unit is tasked with rescuing captured soldiers being held in a heavily guarded German POW camp. As they reach the camp, the soldiers confront the German troops in their most ferocious battle yet. Outnumbered, the unit is at the brink of defeat as the enemy soldiers advance. As more soldiers from their unit fall, Aiden, Steve, and a handful of survivors fortify a position near the injured. With heavy mortar fire and relentless enemy troops closing in, the men must make the most difficult decision - evacuate and save themselves or stay and fight to protect their wounded comrades. Act 4: The Unbreakable Bond Prevails Courcey, knowing the odds of survival have significantly decreased, gathers the remaining soldiers for a final stand. Their intense loyalty to each other, fueled by Courcey's unwavering devotion to no man left behind, powers the men to fight with everything they have. As the enemy advances, each soldier displays extraordinary courage, picking off enemy soldiers one by one. Courcey leads the charge, fighting beside his brothers-in-arms. The unit slowly turns the tide of the battle, ultimately leading to an unexpected air support that decimates the remaining German forces. Epilogue: Returning Home With the camp liberated, Courcey and his surviving soldiers return to England as heroes. Their story of brotherhood, sacrifice, and perseverance defines a legacy that lives on in the hearts and minds of their fellow countrymen. Recognized for their valor, each member of the unit is awarded prestigious military honors. Courcey's devotion to his comrades and the bond they formed become a symbol of hope and inspiration, living on as a beacon of human spirit for future generations of soldiers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens.  - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer.  - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them.   - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons.  - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies.  - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month .  - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information.  - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad.  - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws.  - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law.  - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.  - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\"  - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.  - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers.  - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization.  - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

The next day, Woody finds Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the toys from the showâJessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Peteâare excited about going, Woody intents to return home since he is still one of Andy's toys. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it, meaning they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001.

Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons. Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation.

Answer:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to\\" is not \\"loose\\" when considering that a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to heat. When a rubber band snaps, the particles (or polymer chains) within the rubber band undergo a transformation in their arrangement and energy state. In more detail, here is what occurs: 1. When a rubber band is stretched, the polymer chains align in the direction of tension, leading to an increase in its potential energy. 2. When the rubber band snaps, the potential energy stored in the aligned polymer chains is quickly converted into kinetic energy.  3. The rapid release of energy causes the particles in the rubber band to vibrate. This increased molecular vibration is experienced as heat, which raises the temperature of the rubber band. 4. After snapping, the broken rubber band's particles may also take on a more random arrangement, returning to their relaxed state.

Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In  \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance.  In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\"  according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\"  as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other..., can you guess it ?","output":"The title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major is Handel's \\"Messiah.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Using a glass as a vessel for drinking is considered proper etiquette as it provides a clean, convenient, and visually appealing container designed explicitly for consuming liquids. Here is a breakdown of why the other options are not as suitable: 1. Open mouth: Drinking with an open mouth directly from a container, such as a bottle or pitcher, is considered impolite and unsanitary. It also lacks the refined presentation that using a glass offers. 2. Eat first: Eating before drinking is not necessarily impolite, but it does not address the original question about the appropriate vessel for drinking. This option is more about timing rather than the method of consumption. 3. Buy alcohol: This option is unrelated to the politeness of drinking and does not provide a suitable vessel for consuming a beverage. Choosing to buy alcohol or not is a personal preference and not an answer to the question of how to drink politely. 4. Coffee mug: While a coffee mug is a perfectly acceptable container for drinking certain beverages, such as hot tea or coffee, it is not the universal solution for all drinks. Using a glass is more versatile and visually appealing for a broader range of beverages, making it the best choice when considering the question of achieving politeness in drinking. In conclusion, using a glass is considered the most polite and practical vessel according to social norms and etiquette for consuming beverages. It offers a clean, dedicated container that enhances the drinking experience and is visually appealing, making it the optimal choice amongst the provided options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The fried rice was pretty tasty and I loved the fried delights - egg rolls, crab Rangoon, shrimp.  I did not try the sushi but it did look good!

Though this was its most popular period, the music had actually been around since the late 1920s and early 1930s, being played by black bands led by such artists as Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, and Fletcher Henderson, and white bands from the 1920s led by the likes of Russ Morgan and Isham Jones. The era's beginning is sometimes dated from the King of Swing Benny Goodman's performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, bringing the music to the rest of the country. 1930s also became the era of other great soloists: the tenor saxist Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry; the alto saxists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges; the drummers Gene Krupa, Cozy Cole and Sid Catlett; the pianists Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson; the trumpeters Roy Eldridge, Bunny Berigan, and Rex Stewart.  - A Hole in the Head ( 1959 ) is a comedy film directed by Frank Capra , featuring Frank Sinatra , Edward G.

The film introduced the song \`\` High Hopes '' by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen , a Sinatra standard used as a John F. Kennedy campaign song during the presidential election the following year . Wynn plays a wealthy former friend of Sinatra 's character who expresses interest in his plan to build a Disneyland in Florida ( the film predates Disney World ) -- until he notices that Sinatra seems too desperate as he cheers for a dog upon which he 'd bet heavily . The movie ends with Tony , Eloise and Alley singing \`\` High Hopes '' on the beach . Sinatra sings \`\` All My Tomorrows , '' another Cahn / Van Heusen song , under the opening titles . The screenplay was adapted by playwright Arnold Schulman , whose father was the operator of a Miami , Florida hotel . The protagonist of A Hole in the Head is a Miami hotel operator of \`\` The Garden of Eden . '' The actual hotel used for the exterior shots was the Cardozo Hotel , located on Miami Beach 's Ocean Drive . Shot over 40 days between 10 November 1958 and 9 January 1959 , the film did not enjoy the smoothest of productions , especially during the location filming at Miami Beach . Sinatra 's relations with the press were problematic , the media seizing on every anti-Sinatra rumor they could find . Aided by William Daniels , Capra completed the film a full eighty days ahead of schedule , its final production cost of  1.89 million well under the allotted budget . The film opened on June 17 , 1959 . Although having some positive reviews , the film was only a modest box - office success , grossing  4 million in America .

It was released in April 1955 on Capitol Records, produced by Voyle Gilmore with arrangements by Nelson Riddle. All the songs on the album deal with specific themes such as loneliness, introspection, lost love, failed relationships, depression and night-life; as a result, \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" has been called one of the first concept albums. The cover artwork reflects these themes, portraying Sinatra on an eerie and deserted street awash in blue-tinged street lights. He had been developing this idea since 1946 with his first album release, \\"The Voice\\"; he would successfully continue this \\"concept\\" formula with later albums such as \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\\" and \\"Only the Lonely\\".  - Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915  May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \\"bobby soxers\\". He released his debut album, \\"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\\", in 1946.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. However, I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan. He organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from. Anyway, De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. It's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. Brilliant! To his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. They want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. By a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. He uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. I reckon this film was a missed opportunity. To address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. How come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. De Sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. Surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.

When he leaves the hospital, he finds that certain individuals on the street are following him wherever he goes and paying extra special attention to him.

Article: The earth is 4 600 million years old. We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \\"the greenhouse effect\\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change. All these problems are very serious, so we must do something now. ,A, B, C, D.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. With the coming of the Spirit, everything great is born. Say this using Spanish","output":"\\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso.\\"  Esta frase en español, que se traduce literalmente como \\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso\\", sugiere que cuando el Espíritu (ya sea divino, humano o simplemente una fuerza vital) llega a nuestras vidas, se crea la posibilidad de que surjan cosas maravillosas y extraordinarias. En este contexto, el Espíritu puede representar diversas cosas según el punto de vista personal y las creencias de cada uno, pero en última instancia, simboliza una fuerza poderosa y transformadora que puede impulsar cambios positivos y un crecimiento notable tanto en nuestra vida individual como colectiva. Esta idea del Espíritu como fuente de grandeza y cambio positivo es común en muchas culturas y tradiciones espirituales en todo el mundo. En el cristianismo, el Espíritu Santo es considerado tanto un guía como un consolador; en el hinduismo y el budismo, el concepto de Atman o el \\"Yo supremo\\" representa una chispa divina presente en cada ser. Además, en muchas tradiciones indígenas y paganas, los espíritus de la naturaleza o los antepasados juegan un papel crucial en la dirección y el apoyo en momentos de crisis o transición en la vida. Por lo tanto, la idea de que todo lo grandioso en nuestra existencia proviene de la presencia y la acción del Espíritu es una creencia ampliamente compartida y atesorada en la historia humana. Entendiendo esto, podemos reflexionar sobre cómo se manifiesta el Espíritu en nuestras propias vidas, y cómo podemos estar abiertos a su influencia y guía. A través del autoconocimiento, la autoexploración y la práctica de la atención plena, podemos aprender a detectar y agradecer las muchas maneras en que el Espíritu nos guía en nuestra búsqueda de significado y propósito. Al hacerlo, permitimos que las cosas extraordinarias y grandiosas surjan de nuestros proyectos, relaciones y experiencias, y nos abrimos a la posibilidad de un crecimiento constante y un aprendizaje profundo, tanto en lo personal como en lo colectivo. Por otro lado, también es importante reconocer que la llegada del Espíritu a nuestras vidas es un proceso dinámico y que no siempre es lineal. Pueden existir momentos en los que nos sentimos desconectados de esa fuente inmensa de inspiración y grandeza, pero eso no significa que el Espíritu haya dejado de estar presente en nuestra vida. En estos momentos de confusión o desesperanza, es especialmente crucial recordar nuestra conexión esencial con el Espíritu y buscar activamente formas de reavivarlo en nuestro interior y en nuestras acciones. De hecho, es en estos momentos de oscuridad cuando el Espíritu puede revelar sus lecciones más profundas, al mostrarnos que incluso en medio del sufrimiento y la incertidumbre, somos capaces de crecer y descubrir nuevas facetas de nuestra verdadera naturaleza.  En resumen, la frase \\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso\\" es una afirmación poderosa que nos recuerda de nuestra conexión esencial con una fuerza vital más grande y transformadora presente dentro y fuera de nosotros. A través de la apertura a la influencia y la guía del Espíritu, podemos aprender a cultivar un sentido de grandeza y plenitud en nuestras vidas, y a percibir las muchas maneras en que esta presencia divina nos sostiene y nos inspira en nuestro camino."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Rashid Khalikov of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will lead the mission, she said. \\"It's an initial mission and we would hope to go back in to do detailed assessments.\\" Pillay said the report concluded that \\"the abuses and human rights violations going on on the ground undermine the proclaimed reform package,\\" and that she had recommended Syria be referred to the","output":"International Criminal Court for investigation into potential crimes against humanity. The recommendation was based on documented cases of widespread and systematic human rights violations, including the use of excessive force, torture, and enforced disappearances. Instances of arbitrary detention and attacks on civilian populations were also cited as grounds for referral. The United Nations' involvement in Syria reflects a growing international concern over the country's escalating violence and the Assad regime's disregard for basic human rights. The UN's intervention is seen as a necessary step in protecting those who have been caught in the crossfire and to hold those responsible for these violations accountable. In addition to the humanitarian mission, multiple strategies for resolution are being considered by the international community. These measures include economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and, in extreme cases, possible military intervention to enforce a ceasefire and ensure the implementation of reforms. The United Nations and other international organizations, such as the Arab League and the European Union, have issued strong statements condemning the Syrian government's actions, urging for an end to the violence and a peaceful transition towards democracy. The humanitarian mission's findings will play a crucial role in shaping the international community's response to the crisis and determining the next steps to be taken. It is essential that investigators on the ground gather accurate and comprehensive information regarding the human rights abuses being perpetrated, as well as assessing the humanitarian situation in areas that have been most severely affected. This data will be critical in informing the development of strategies to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and to ensure that those responsible for the ongoing atrocities are held accountable. Ultimately, the situation in Syria is complex and fraught with challenges. However, by conducting a thorough analysis of the current state of affairs and working in concert with international partners, the United Nations has the potential to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the lives of those affected by the ongoing crisis.

Summarize this article: Pope Francis waves at faithfuls upon his arrival at St.Peter’s square for the weekly general audience on March 5, 2014 AFP/Getty Images      Thursday is the one-year anniversary of Pope Francis’s election, and the 266th pope remains as popular as ever. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds 55% hold a positive view of the pope, compared to just 7% who hold a negative view. About a quarter of Americans didn’t have an opinion.      His popularity has held steady in recent months, but has skyrocketed since last July, when 35% said they viewed the pope positively.      Pope Francis has fared far better than his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had a 30% approval rating when he left office in February.      The pope consistently ranks better among more educated Americans, with 66% of people who had received a postgraduate degree saying they viewed him positively, compared with 48% of those who had completed some or all of high school.      Democrats are also fonder of the pope than Republicans or independents are. Some 62% of Democrats said they viewed Pope Francis positively, compared with 53% of Republicans and 41% of independents.      Since his election, the pope has drawn significant media attention with his personal warmth and his efforts to set a new tone for the Catholic Church. Last week, a media firestorm ensued when, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the pope said the church must evaluate gay civil unions, though he maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. Last September, he remarked that the church had grown “obsessed” with abortion, gay marriage and contraception and called for a “new balance” in the church.      A strong majority of Catholics have also responded positively to Pope Francis, with 60% saying they agreed with the statement, “Pope Francis has renewed and strengthened my religious faith and commitment to the Catholic Church”—compared to 31% who said they disagreed.      Women were far more likely than men to agree with that statement, with 70% reporting they did, compared with 50% of men. Older Catholics were also more likely to feel renewed faith than younger ones, with 61% of Catholics over the age of 61 saying they agreed with the statement, compared to 51% of Catholics aged 18 to 34.

His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had resigned the month before, citing a decline in his physical and mental strength, leading to an almost unprecedented handover of power. After the remote, intellectual German theologian came the church's first Jesuit leader, its first Latin American pontiff – and the first pope to take the name of Francis.      The pope was elected with a mandate to shake up the church in Rome and help turn the page on an increasingly fraught and scandal-bedevilled papacy. His many fans argue he has vigorously pursued a reformist agenda within the Vatican while radically improving the church's image outside it. But, as Rome marks his first anniversary, just how successful has this peculiarly popular pontiff been?      Good works            Image management      Pope Francis blesses Vinicio Riva in November. Photograph: Claudio Peri/EPA      Talk of the \\"Pope Francis effect\\" is ubiquitous for a reason: since stepping out on to the balcony of St Peter's on the evening of 13 March 2013 to joke that the cardinal-electors had been forced to cast their nets to \\"the end of the Earth\\" to find a successor to Benedict, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has scarcely put a humbly shod foot wrong PR-wise. Despite adhering to church teaching as closely as his predecessor, Francis has, through a mixture of charm, humour and openness, turned many preconceptions – and prejudices – on their heads. His decision to abjure the splendour of the apostolic palace in favour of the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse has offered proof of his personal commitment to a humbler church, while his tender embracing of Vinicio Riva, a man terribly disfigured by tumours, underlined his hands-on pastoral approach. Such actions saw him voted person of the year by both Time magazine and the US gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, while his Twitter account - @pontifex – has almost 3.8 million followers.      Church governance      Francis's decision to appoint eight \\"outsider\\" cardinals to advise him on church reform was described by one observer as the \\"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries\\". The council, which includes cardinals from the US, Australia, India, Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has inevitably been dubbed the papal G8. \\"[They are] not courtiers but wise people who share my feelings,\\" said Francis, who has often been scathing about the \\"introspective and Vatican-centric\\" nature of the Holy See. \\"This is the start of a church with not just a vertical but horizontal organisation.\\" Jesuits, who have had to wait almost 500 years to see one of their number sit on the papal throne, proudly point out that consultation is one of the foundations of their order.      Overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops      Pope Francis meets bishops at the end of his weekly general audience, in St Peter's Square last month. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP      As well as assembling his own G8, Francis has revamped the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican department responsible for selecting bishops. By appointing 12 new members and not confirming 14 existing members, he rebalanced the department to make it more moderate and progressive. Among those who were not confirmed was the highly influential conservative US cardinal Raymond Burke, who has been an outspoken critic of US presidential candidates who are in favour of abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning and same-sex marriage. New members include Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales praised for his pastoral and inclusive style, whom Francis made a cardinal last month. The papal historian Michael Walsh described the overhaul of the congregation as a \\"tectonic shift\\" in governance.      Inclusivity      On Maundy Thursday 2013, a fortnight after becoming pope, Francis exhorted his priests to abandon introspection and to get out \\"to the outskirts where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters\\". He washed and kissed the feet of two Muslims – one a woman – at a youth detention centre near Rome. It was the first time a pontiff had included women in the ceremony. For many, the greatest proof of the pope's commitment to inclusivity and his desire to appeal to those who have long felt ignored or criticised by the church came during an impromptu press conference on a flight back from Brazil in July. \\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\\" he asked journalists.      Anglican relations      Francis's determination to \\"intensify dialogue among the various religions\\" has not been confined to reaching out to Jews and Muslims. Last June, he had lunch with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the pair chatted for four hours. Despite frosty relations that have existed between the churches in recent years – caused mainly by the C of E's decision to ordain women and Pope Benedict's creation of an ordinariate to bring disaffected Anglicans into the embrace of Rome – Francis and Welby appear to have a genuine rapport. According to Sir David Moxon, the archbishop of Canterbury's representative to the Holy See and director of the Anglican centre in Rome, there was an \\"immediate chemistry\\" between the two leaders, whom Moxon describes as \\"men of action\\" equally committed to tackling poverty and social injustice. It has not hurt that Welby's personal spiritual director is a Benedictine monk; nor that the archbishop recently signalled a further rapprochement by inviting members of a Roman Catholic ecumenical community to take up residence in Lambeth Palace.      Political player      Pope Francis (kissing the feet of a young offender during a mass at the church of the Casal del Marmo youth prison on the outskirts of Rome in 2013. Photograph: AFP      It was no accident that Francis chose a career Vatican diplomat, Pietro Parolin, as his secretary of state, a position often likened to the papal prime minister. The pope has shown a desire to put the Vatican back on the international stage as a key player in external – not just messy, internal – affairs, and his stance on Syria has been the clearest sign that under him the Catholic church's voice will be loud and clear. With an open letter to the leaders of the G20, repeated exhortations for a non-violent, mediated solution, and a day-long fast and mass prayer vigil, he provided a moral counterweight to the Obama administration and its proposed air strikes. His powerful criticisms of capitalist excesses have seen the church regain relevance in the contemporary debate on social justice. And his decision to make Lampedusa the location of his first trip outside Rome, slamming a \\"globalisation of indifference\\" that allowed migrants to die in the Mediterranean, he focused the eyes of the world on an often-overlooked problem.\\"      The jury's out      Curia reform      The \\"outsider\\" pope was elected with a mandate to come to Rome and bang heads together. In the fading light of Benedict's papacy, infighting and corruption within the Curia – the Vatican's central bureaucracy – had dominated amid the so-called Vatileaks affair. Francis has announced measures to engender reform, most notably the creation of a secretariat of the economy – a kind of finance ministry – to centralise the handling of business and administrative affairs. That will be led by the outspoken Australian Cardinal George Pell. The other key staffing decision was to replace the widely discredited Tarcisio Bertone as secretary of state –a symbolic and practical move Francis must hope will draw a line under an era of scandal and incompetence.      Core teachings      The pope appearing in a selfie taken by young pilgrims in St Peter's, Rome. Photograph: AP      Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations. The pope has made clear his commitment to core church teachings on issues such as abortion and women's ordination. But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. For one thing, Francis has said the church needs a \\"new balance\\" and a less condemnatory attitude to sexual morality. For another, he has shown himself to be a pragmatic conservative, committed to doctrine but concerned with how the church responds to pastoral realities. In concrete terms, speculation centres on whether he will see fit to announce a shift on the treatment of remarried divorcees, now banned from receiving holy communion. Walter Kasper, the cardinal Francis chose to speak on the subject at a consistory earlier this year, told La Repubblica newspaper this week that the church should try to find a \\"realistic application of doctrine\\", adding: \\"The church must never judge as though it had a guillotine in its hands.\\"      Vatican Bank      All too often the cause of embarrassment for the papacy, the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) is at the heart of Francis's reform – and ethical finance – agenda. He has set up a commission of lay experts and clerics to investigate the bank's running, and has replaced four of five cardinals appointed under Benedict on an oversight body. Under German president Ernst von Freyberg, the bank is trying to improve transparency and has hired an outside firm of accountants to help it meet international standards. But an Italian investigation into allegations of money laundering – which the bank denies – continues and a report by a Council of Europe body, Moneyval, in December said the IOR still had some way to go. Francis has made it clear that, if the bank cannot be adequately reformed, he would have no compunction about closing it for good.      Must try harder            Clerical sex abuse      There are growing suspicions that this, more than any other issue, is emerging as Francis's blind spot. Critics say he has done little to ramp up the church's response to the scandal. Though he has said officials must \\"act decisively\\" on the problem – and in December announced a new commission to examine ways of better protecting children and helping victims – most advocates for abuse victims say another commission is not what is needed and criticise him for not making the deep changes they, and the UN, say are necessary. They have been left despondent by Francis's occasional comments on the issue, in which he has generally defended the church while condemning the abuse. An interview published this month in which he claimed that no other institution had acted with the same \\"transparency and responsibility\\" elicited particular anger. \\"His comments about clerical sex abuse [in the interview] make it clear that he is using the same tired and irrelevant playbook the bishops have worn out over the past few years,\\" wrote priest and victims' supporter Tom Doyle in the National Catholic Reporter. ||||| Pope Francis is celebrating his first year in office.      The Argentinean-born pontiff is currently on a week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops in the Alban Hills near Rome.      Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff.      However, the BBC's David Willey in Rome says that Francis's papacy so far has shown a change of style rather than of substance.      Pope Francis is the first Latin American - and the first Jesuit - to lead the Roman Catholic Church.      Pope Francis eschews the superstar status he has been accorded by the world's media Pope marks one year at Vatican      Since taking office, pilgrims have been arriving in Rome in unprecedented numbers.      He is also riding high on social media, with 11 million following him in nine languages on Twitter.      Our correspondent says Francis's approval rating has remained high despite a recent UN report accusing the Catholic Church of systematically covering up for tens of thousands of child-abusing priests reported to the Vatican.      The Pope himself has denounced any cult of personality.      He recently told Corriere della Sera: \\"Portraying the pope as a kind of superman, a type of star, it seems offensive.\\"      Pope Francis's reforms are not popular with some conservative Catholics      Pope Francis travelled by bus to spend the first anniversary of his election in a spiritual retreat      In Argentina artefacts to mark the anniversary are widely on display      Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff      Francis, 77, has appointed new advisers to help him run the Church and is planning major reforms of Vatican finances and of the scandal-hit Vatican bank.      But our correspondent adds that for the moment there is no sign of a change in official Catholic teaching on artificial contraception or on the celibacy rule for priests.      However the Pope's compassionate attitude - especially his outreach to believers who have abandoned going to Mass and to divorced Catholics banned from receiving communion - is not universally admired by traditionalist cardinals.      Likewise his attitude towards gay people - he says that he is not going to judge them - contrasts strongly with that of his predecessor Pope Benedict, who called homosexuality \\"intrinsically evil\\".      Thursday's anniversary is not being marked in any official way, a move that Vatican-watchers say is in keeping with the Pope's tendency to eschew pomp and ceremony.      The decision to celebrate the anniversary quietly is a sound alternative to what almost certainly would have been a media frenzy if Pope Francis had decided to mark the anniversary in public, correspondents say. ||||| Religion makes a lot of mistakes.      Faith traditions can be so harsh that they drive away everyone but the self-righteous scolds. Or they can so indulge in therapeutic comfort and manufactured joy that they come to seem like a charlatan’s game.      E.J. Dionne writes about politics in a twice-weekly column and on the PostPartisan blog. He is also a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, a government professor at Georgetown University and a frequent commentator on politics for National Public Radio, ABC’s “This Week” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” View Archive      They can be so otherworldly that they offer no guidance to those living in this one on matters of justice, freedom and how we should live together. Or they are so captive to the here-and-now that it becomes hard to distinguish between a congregation and a party headquarters.      And for many in the wealthy nations and among the young, religion has no relevance to their lives whatsoever. It’s seen by some as a charming throwback and by others as one more insidious force focused on power, money and self-preservation.      When Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope a year ago, only a few expected that the new Catholic leader would confront all of these challenges simultaneously.      1 of 27 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Pope Francis: Acts of humility View Photos The new prelate, who has been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year, is rewriting the rules in his first year at the Vatican.

Yes, his choice of the name Francis was a promising sign that he would emulate a saint devoted to the poor and to simplicity. Yes, he was already on record with searing criticisms of the injustices of global capitalism. From the beginning, he stressed his more humble role as the “Bishop of Rome,” suggesting an anti-imperial papacy.      And then it continued. He disdained the trappings of piety and might, including the ornate regalia that appeal to so many prelates. The Roman joke was that as priests got with his program, one could find many lacy surplices on sale at steep discounts on eBay. On his first Holy Thursday, Francis washed the feet not of the usual group of priests but rather of a dozen young people being held at a juvenile detention center, including two women and two Muslims.      He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking. “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,” he has said. “This is not possible.” He thus declared that the church’s main mission would no longer be as a lead combatant in the culture wars. It would stand primarily with and for the neediest.      The most important aspect of a Pew survey released this month was not its finding that 68 percent of U.S. Catholics thought Francis was changing the church for the better, or that 76 percent said he was doing a good or excellent job of addressing the needs and concerns of the poor. No, the truly revealing fact about this study is that it did not even occur to Pew’s pollsters to ask in their benchmark poll a year ago whether poverty should be a priority of the new pope. This is no knock on Pew; the fact that its researchers had to include a new question about poverty this year shows how much Francis has transformed the church.      The pope said recently that he was uncomfortable with being seen as a “superman,” and indeed, he is not. Francis expressed his unease in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera during which he made the most troubling misstep of the year.      Speaking of the pedophilia scandal that has shaken the faith of so many Catholics, particularly in the United States and in Ireland, Francis was uncharacteristically defensive and aggressive, insisting that the Catholic Church “is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility.”      “No one has done more,” he added, “and yet the church is the only one that has been attacked.”      Pope Francis had a noteworthy first year as head of the Catholic church. PostTV reviews a few of the pope's memorable photo ops that seem to parallel with common Bible passages. We used The New American Bible. (Jonathan Elker, Gillian Brockell and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post)      In fact, the church is not “the only one that has been attacked.” Even if it were, a pope who has emphasized the urgency of seeing the world from the perspective of the vulnerable and the wounded should have been the first to hear how his words might sound to the victims of abuse. A leader who has criticized a “psychology of princes” and the “spirit of careerism” should have known better.      But the keen disappointment felt over this is a mark of how high Francis has lifted expectations. He has shown that the spiritual life is also a life of social commitment. He demands a lot while preaching about a God of mercy, confounding scolds and religious therapists alike. By engaging joyfully with nonbelievers and those who believe differently, he speaks to those skeptical that Christianity has anything left to say.      He called for a church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets” and has proved that such a church is hard to ignore.      Read more from E.J.

This view was challenged by the \\"rationalist\\" Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenic view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate.

Question: What strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region?","output":"The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and the teachings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of the origin of power in the Mediterranean region. This transformation occurred as Islam rapidly expanded its influence, challenging existing power structures, and introducing new ideas and philosophies that reshaped the region's cultural, political, and religious landscape. One of the critical aspects of the rise of Islam was the emphasis it placed on the interconnection between science and religion, asserting that these two domains were interlinked and could not be separated. Islamic teaching promoted the process of ijtihad, which referred to the intellectual effort and rigorous interpretation of Islamic law, religious principles, and scriptures in order to discover the truth. As a result, all philosophical inquiries and debates took on a \\"political\\" aspect, as they held significant implications for governance and societal organization. This interconnected approach, however, was challenged by the rationalist Mutazilite philosophers, who took a more Hellenic perspective, where reason and logical thinking took precedence over revelation and religious scripture. They were the first speculative theologians of Islam and were supported by a secular aristocracy that wanted greater autonomy and freedom from the influence of the Caliphate. Eventually, however, the traditionalist Asharite view of Islam gained prominence by the late ancient period. According to the Asharites, reason and rational thought must be subordinate to the authority of the Quran, which is the central religious text of Islam, and the Sunna, which refers to the traditions and practices associated with the life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. In this view, understanding and interpretation had to be aligned with the fundamental sources of Islamic belief, reinforcing religious authority over a more individualistic and rational approach. Thus, the rise of Islam, encompassing the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of the origin of power in the Mediterranean region. The ongoing debates and evolution of Islamic philosophy, along with its focus on the relationship between science, religion, and governance, were instrumental in reshaping the cultural, political, and religious landscape of the region in that period."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: If a neutral atom loses an electron then an atom with a negative charge will be formed.

(ii). pond was safer..","output":"Hamza's pet turtle liked to be in the water dish instead of the pond, because the dish was safer. The compact size and shallower depth of the water dish provided the turtle with a sense of security, as it could easily retreat into its shell should it sense any danger or disturbance in its environment. Additionally, the physical barrier of the dish's walls prevented potential predators from accessing and threatening the turtle, unlike in the pond whose larger size attracted a wider range of animals, both aquatic and land-dwelling, which posed a greater risk to the turtle's safety. Furthermore, the water dish offered a more stable and predictable environment for Hamza's pet turtle. The water temperature and quality within the dish were easier to maintain, ensuring that the turtle had optimal living conditions. This was particularly important since turtles, being ectothermic animals, heavily rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature. In the pond, water quality and temperature could fluctuate due to various external factors such as weather, pollution, and the presence of other organisms, which could negatively impact the turtle's health and well-being. Another reason the dish was safer for the turtle was the reduced risk of injury from navigating the pond's environment. The pond might have had submerged obstacles, such as rocks or vegetation, that the turtle could get caught in or injured by while swimming. The simple layout of the dish eliminated potential hazards and allowed the turtle to swim and bask with ease. Moreover, the limited space within the water dish made it easier for Hamza to monitor his pet turtle's behavior and overall health. Given that the pond would have offered numerous hiding places and a vast space for the turtle to roam, it might have been difficult to spot any signs of illness or injury early on. In the water dish, any changes in the turtle's behavior, appearance, or appetite could be monitored and addressed more promptly, ensuring that the turtle received proper care and maintained good health. Lastly, the water dish provided Hamza's pet turtle with an environment that closely resembled its natural habitat, giving it a comfortable and soothing space to live in. Many turtle species favor smaller, shallow water bodies where they can easily climb out to bask and hide if necessary. The water dish catered to these preferences much better than the pond, which might have been deeper and more difficult for the turtle to navigate. In conclusion, the water dish was a safer choice for Hamza's pet turtle due to the increased sense of security, easier environmental control, reduced risk of injury, improved monitoring, and resemblance to the turtle's natural habitat. While the pond might have provided more swimming space and visual appeal, the dish ultimately better catered to the turtle's needs, ensuring its safety and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Last updated at 9:55 AM on 4th November 2011. Britain's beleaguered Post Offices came under attack yesterday in a move which will leave millions of savers stranded. In a shock announcement, National Savings & Investments revealed plans to end its 150-year relationship with the network. It marks a watershed moment for the two organisations, which used to be one company called the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. They were separated in 1969. Goodbye letter: National Savings & Investments are to end their 150-year relationship with the Post Office. The country’s 11,800 Post Offices. are a vital lifeline for savers, particularly the elderly, who go into. their local branch to withdraw money from their NS&I savings. NS&I. products, such as its Investment Account which has 2.4million users,. are hugely popular because it is the only savings giant which offers a. 100 per cent guarantee on all money. But. yesterday NS&I said it has decided to gradually cut its ties with. the Post Office, in a move described by postal experts as ‘bitterly. disappointing’. They fear it is another nail in the coffin for the Post Offices which, in many villages, represent the only remaining shop. Over. the next two years, NS&I will force all its customers to start. using the internet, the telephone or the post to contact them. They will. not be able to use the Post Office for common transactions such as. depositing or withdrawing money. There. is only one exception. Premium Bonds will still be bought and sold at. Post Office counters for at least the next four years. The. contract will be reviewed in 2015, although an NS&I spokesman said. yesterday that a review is ‘perfectly normal’ and should not raise. alarm. She added: ‘We intend for Premium Bonds to remain on sale over the Post Office counter.’ The Post Office has been. haemorrhaging lucrative Government contracts, such as renewing the BBC. TV licence. Most recently, it emerged it will lose the £20million a year. so-called ‘Green Giros’ contract – the payment of benefit cheques to. vulnerable people with no bank account. George Thomson, general secretary of the. National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, said: ‘We are surprised and. bitterly disappointed by NS&I’s decision. This news reinforces the. urgent need for ministers to deliver on their pledge to make the Post. Office the “front office” for government.’ Ministers have repeatedly pledged that. there will be ‘no programme of closures’ like under the previous. Government. When Labour came to power in 1997, there were just over. 19,000 outlets in the UK. As a result of Labour’s closure programme,. there are now 11,800. The first two NS&I accounts to be. hit – the Investment Account and the Easy Access Savings Account – have. a total of more than 2.5million customers who have a total of. £6.2billion with NS&I. But. last night it said the Children’s Bonus Bonds, which has 1.2million. customers, will also disappear from Post Offices at some point. An. NS&I spokesman said: ‘We have not finalised our plans but we expect. them to be only available from NS&I.’ The. decision was fuelled by the Post Office’s decision to set up its own. savings arm, in a joint venture with the Bank of Ireland in 2004. It has. around £13billion of savers’ money. A. Department for Business spokesman said: ‘This Government is committed. to the Post Office network, which is why we have set aside £1.34billion. of funding over the next four years to help secure its future.’ Ian Tonks, national officer at Unite,. said: ‘This will only serve to increase financial exclusion, preventing. citizens without access to the internet from accessing NS&I. products.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about National Savings & Investments (NS&I) planning to end its 150-year relationship with the Post Office.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...  answer the following question:  What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm? Answer:","output":"The two fleets involved in the Battle of Bornholm were the Danish-Dutch allied fleet under Admiral Niels Juel and Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, and the Swedish fleet under Admiral Creutz."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that did not meet commercial expectations and broke up in 1978?  Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook.  Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.  According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

Question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what currency in dominican republic should i bring? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I need to provide you with the correct currency used in the Dominican Republic and suggest which currency you should bring for your convenience during your travels.  Step 1: Identify the official currency of the Dominican Republic The official currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican Peso (DOP). Step 2: Provide information on major currencies accepted in the Dominican Republic Apart from the Dominican Peso, the US Dollar (USD) is widely accepted in tourist areas and major businesses. Other currencies, such as Euros (EUR), might be accepted at some places but could have limited use. Step 3: Consider factors like exchange rates, fees, and accessibility Bringing local currency (DOP) is usually more convenient and economical, as there won't be any conversion fees, and its use is unrestricted. Also, when using foreign currencies, you may not receive the best exchange rates or may have issues when making small purchases with larger denomination bills. Step 4: Evaluate options for obtaining currency You can exchange money at banks, hotels, and official exchange bureaus (casas de cambio) in the Dominican Republic. ATMs are also widespread and a practical way to obtain Dominican Pesos. However, be aware of fees associated with currency exchange and using foreign cards at ATMs. Step 5: Provide the final answer You should primarily bring Dominican Pesos (DOP) when traveling to the Dominican Republic, as it is the official currency and accepted everywhere. Additionally, you can consider bringing US Dollars (USD) for backup, especially in tourist areas where it is widely accepted.

Put some in a small saucepan. If cooking over medium heat put water over the liquid and bring to a boil: This option is not clear on what is being put in the saucepan, so it isn't a strong candidate for continuing the paragraph about making brown gravy. 2. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan. Melt the butter on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning: This option provides a clear step in the gravy-making process and specifies the amount of butter and heat level, making it a good choice for continuing the paragraph. 3. Pour the brown gravy into a large bowl. This will make a gravy big enough to cover all the ingredients: This option seems to describe the final result rather than the process of making brown gravy, so it doesn't fit well as the next step in the paragraph. 4. The recipe calls for a ratio of 3 sugars to 1 1/2 cups water to prevent obstacles in addition to serving as the sauce. Three tablespoons of white flour is a good recommendation to have in order to ensure a smooth and meaty gravy: This statement is somewhat confusing and not well focused on the process of making brown gravy. After analyzing the options, the best choice for continuing the paragraph is: [+] Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan. Melt the butter on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: A toddler is a child 12 to 36 months old. The toddler years are a time of great cognitive, emotional and social development. The word is derived from \`\`to toddle'', which means to walk unsteadily, like a child of this age. Question: is a four year old still a toddler? Choose from: * no; * yes;","output":"To answer this question, I need to analyze the information given. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the definition of a toddler. According to the provided text, a toddler is a child aged 12 to 36 months, or 1 to 3 years old. Step 2: Determine the age of a four-year-old. A four-year-old is 48 months old. Step 3: Compare the age of a four-year-old to the age range of a toddler. 48 months (age of a four-year-old) falls outside the age range for a toddler (12 to 36 months). Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison. Since a four-year-old is older than 36 months, they are not considered a toddler. Therefore, the answer is: * no;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The idea and terminology evolved from the \\"marking up\\" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.  - A document type definition (DTD) is a set of \\"markup declarations\\" that define a \\"document type\\" for an SGML-family markup language (SGML, XML, HTML).  - In computing, plain text is the data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of characters that control simple arrangement of text, such as line breaks or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included, and from \\"binary files\\" in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).  - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers.

Two men named Ty and Vachel are hunting in a forest and come across an abandoned church, which they go in to explore. After Ty sees their truck being crashed into a tree, Vachel is stabbed with a serrated machete by a chuckling assailant who then dons Vachel's hat and jacket. Ty, seeing the murderer come out of the church, quietly flees off into the forest. Meanwhile, forest ranger Roy McLean is at his home, where he encounters a van of five college-aged adults heading to rural property which one of them has inherited. Despite his insistence that they not venture up the mountain, the five continue along. Among them are Warren; his girlfriend Constance; Jonathan, and his girlfriend, Megan; and Daniel, Jonathan's brother. On their way up the mountain, they hit a deer, and encounter Ty stumbling through the woods on his way down the mountain; they dismiss his warnings of \\"demons,\\" as he is visibly drunk. After reaching a point where the van cannot drive any further, the group set out on foot and make a campsite; at night, while around the fire, Constance, Megan, and Daniel hear noises around them and become frightened, only to find that Jonathan and Warren are playing a joke on them.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.
