Answer the following question: Information:  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - Victoria Falls, or Mosi-oa-Tunya (Tokaleya Tonga: \\"The Smoke That Thunders\\"), is a waterfall in southern Africa on the Zambezi River at the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. It has been described by CNN as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world.  - The Tokaleya people are indigenous to the area surrounding Victoria Falls in Zambia and Zimbabwe. They comprise two related groups, the Toka (Batoka) and the Leya (Baleya), and they speak dialects of the Tonga language.  - The Cable News Network (CNN) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner. It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel; however, by April 2016, a CNN executive officially described the channel as \\"no longer a TV news network\\" and instead as \\"a 24-hour global multiplatform network.\\" Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage, and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.  - Modern-day Matabeleland is a region in Zimbabwe divided into three provinces: Matabeleland North, Bulawayo and Matabeleland South. These provinces are in the west and south-west of Zimbabwe, between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers. The region is named after its inhabitants the Ndebele people. Other ethnic groups who inhabit parts of Matabeleland include the Tonga, Kalanga, Venda and other peoples. As of August 2012, according to the ZIMSAT or Zimbabwe national statistics agency, the southern part of the region had 683,893 people, with the make up of 326,697 males and 356,926 females with an average size household of 4.4 in an area of . As for the Matabeleland Northern Province, it had a total population of 749,017 people out of the population of Zimbabwe of 13,061,239. The proportion of male and female population was 48 and 52 percent respectively within an area of just over . The remaining Bulawayo province had a population of 653,337 in an area of . Thus the region has a combined population of 2,086,247 in an area of just over and that is just over the size of England. The major city is Bulawayo, other notable towns are Plumtree and Hwange. The land is particularly fertile but dry. This area has important gold deposits. Industries include gold and other mineral mines, and engineering. There has been a decline in the industries in this region as water is in short supply. Promises by the government to draw water for the region through the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project have not been carried out. The region is allegedly marginalised by the government.  - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.   - Victoria Falls is a town in the province of Matabeleland North , Zimbabwe . It lies on the southern bank of the Zambezi River at the western end of the Victoria Falls themselves . It is connected by road and railway to Hwange ( 109 km away ) and Bulawayo ( 440 km away ) , both to the south - east . According to the 2012 Population Census , the town had a population of 33,060 . Victoria Falls Airport is located 18 km south of the town and has international services to Johannesburg and Namibia . The settlement began in 1901 when the possibility of using the waterfall for hydro - electric power was explored , and expanded when the railway from Bulawayo reached the town shortly before the Victoria Falls Bridge was opened in April 1905 , connecting Zimbabwe to what is now Zambia . It became the principal tourism centre for the Falls , experiencing economic booms from the 1930s to the 1960s and in the 1980s and early 1990s .  - Bulawayo is the second-largest city in Zimbabwe after the capital Harare, with, as of the 2012 census, a population of 653,337. It is located in Matabeleland, 439 km (273 mi) southwest of Harare, and is now treated as a separate provincial area from Matabeleland. The capital of Matabeleland North is now Lupane, as Bulawayo is a stand-alone province.  - The Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.  - Hwange is a town in Zimbabwe, located in Hwange District, in Matabeleland North Province, in northwestern Zimbabwe, close to the international borders with Botswana and Zambia. It lies approximately , by road, southeast of Victoria Falls, the nearest large city. The town lies on the railway line from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, to Victoria Falls.

Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn’t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures. It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway). DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

Translate to French: The principal drawback of corrugated boxes is that compressive and burst strength is significantly reduced under conditions of high humidity (90% plus) where up to half normal strength can be lost.","output":"L'inconvénient principal des boîtes en carton ondulé est que la résistance à la compression et la résistance à l'éclatement sont considérablement réduites dans des conditions d'humidité élevée (90% et plus), où jusqu'à la moitié de la résistance normale peut être perdue. Dans ces conditions d'humidité élevée, la structure du carton ondulé devient moins efficace pour résister aux contraintes mécaniques auxquelles il est soumis. Cela est dû au fait que l'humidité pénètre dans les fibres de cellulose qui composent le carton, ce qui provoque une diminution de la rigidité et de la solidité de l'ensemble du matériau. En conséquence, les boîtes en carton ondulé sont moins capables de protéger leur contenu contre les impacts et les forces de compression. De plus, l'humidité élevée peut également provoquer une dégradation plus rapide des cartons ondulés en raison de la croissance de moisissures et autres micro-organismes. Ces organismes peuvent dégrader les fibres de cellulose et réduire encore davantage la résistance et la durée de vie du carton. Il existe plusieurs solutions pour remédier à ce problème, telles que l'ajout de couches imperméables ou hydrofuges dans les boîtes en carton ondulé, l'utilisation de matériaux alternatifs plus résistants à l'humidité, ou le contrôle de l'humidité ambiante dans les espaces de stockage et de transport.

Information:  - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.  - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is...  - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals.  - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China.  - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa  but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\").  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.  - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances.  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems.  - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.  - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing.  - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\"  a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).  - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century.  - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

Paris, France (CNN) -- She's been called \\"beautiful,\\" \\"hot\\" and \\"sexy\\" but when it comes to tennis, the most apt description for Maria Sharapova has to be \\"tough.\\"  The Russian rallied from a set down three straight times to reach this year's French Open final and then prevailed in Saturday's thrilling three-hour finale against rising star Simona Halep, 6-4 6-7 6-4.  \\"This is the toughest grand slam final I've ever played,\\" Sharapova, who was contesting a ninth such match, summed up as she collected her trophy.  Even after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults, Sharapova still had the edge.  She's almost a sure thing in third sets on clay, having triumphed 20 times in a row. It's been six years since the 27-year-old was defeated after capturing the first set in a clay-court match, too.  But if Halep maintains this form, it won't be long before she opens her grand slam account.  Smaller and with less power than Sharapova, the Romanian nonetheless almost did the unthinkable -- toughing out the now five-time grand slam champion. Her manager, Virginia Ruzici, remains the last Romanian to win a grand slam, in Paris in 1978.  Sharapova famously uttered in 2007 that she felt like a \\"cow on ice\\" playing on clay but the French Open has now become her most productive grand slam -- it's the only one she's won more than once and it's the only one she's won after two serious shoulder injuries in 2008 and 2013.  1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Andrew Young says John Edwards asked him to fake paternity test on Rielle Hunter's baby      BoundsAP; SussmanGetty John Edwards has reportedly split from Elizabeth Edwards and admitted to fathering Rielle Hunter's baby.      Prissy presidential candidate John Edwards wanted a paternity test done on his mistress' baby but didn't want to get his hands dirty - so he had a flunky steal a diaper.      That filthy tale emerged Thursday on the same day the former North Carolina senator finally came clean and admitted fathering the almost 2-year-old daughter of Rielle Hunter.      No sooner did Edwards reconfirm that he is both a cad and a liar, when NBC News reported that he and his incurable-cancer-stricken wife had separated.      It appeared that even Elizabeth Edwards, who publicly stood by her louse of a spouse, had enough of the onetime Democratic Party darling who paid more attention to combing his tresses than telling the truth.      Edwards didn't have the nerve to face the cameras - he claimed paternity of Frances Quinn Hunter in a statement.      \\"I am Quinn's father,\\" Edwards wrote. \\"It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter, and hopefully one day, when she understands, she will forgive me.\\"      Edwards also apologized for lying to supporters.      \\"To all those I have disappointed and hurt, these words will never be enough, but I am truly sorry,\\" he said.      The awful admissions came a week before ABC News' \\"2-0/20\\" was to air an exclusive interview with Edwards' former aide Andrew Young whose book on the sordid affair, \\"The Politician,\\" is due out next month.      Blinded by loyalty, Young - a married father of three - tried to take the fall for his boss by claiming he was Quinn's daddy. He later admitted that, too, was a lie.      Edwards' sudden decision to fess up prompted ABC to dribble out excerpts of an exclusive interview Bob Woodruff did with Young, which airs in full Jan. 29.      They revealed Edwards was desperate to distance himself from the daughter he professes to love.      \\"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results,\\" Young said Edwards told him. \\"And he asked me ... to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.\\"      Elizabeth Edwards told the Associated Press \\"the whole family's relieved\\" by the long-belated confession. As for their future, she claimed not to have a clue.      \\"If somebody has a crystal ball, they can let me know,\\" she said.      Not so long ago, Elizabeth Edwards insisted it did not matter to her whether her husband fathered a child with Hunter. \\"That would be a part of John's life, but not a part of mine,\\" she said.      Friends say she is living in the family home while Edwards bunks at the beach house. A former campaign aide said they are apparently separated. \\"To my knowledge, they are still trying to appear they are together. Nobody thinks they are under the same roof.\\" ||||| For the first time, John Edwards is publicly admitting that he is indeed the father of a 2-year-old daughter conceived with Rielle Hunter, a campaign videographer with whom he had an affair.      In a written statement provided exclusively to NBC News, the former North Carolina senator and Democratic presidential candidate says he’s taking responsibility for the child, Frances Quinn Hunter:      “I am Quinn’s father. I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves. I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.      It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she will forgive me. I have been providing financial support for Quinn and have reached an agreement with her mother to continue providing support in the future.      To all those I have disappointed and hurt these words will never be enough, but I am truly sorry.”      Harrison Hickman, Edwards’ close friend and personal adviser, spoke to NBC’s Lisa Myers on Edwards’ behalf.      “The senator wants to say, first of all, that he is the father of Quinn,” Hickman said. “Secondly, he wants people to know that he has provided for her and will continue to provide for her, as he should, both financially and emotionally.”      Edwards is not speaking publicly today, at least in part because of an ongoing federal investigation into whether campaign money was used to try to cover up the affair. He has denied wrongdoing. Hickman said that Edwards wanted to be honest about his child, but also wanted to protect his privacy.      “He’s not doing this as a way to try to bring attention to himself,” Hickman said. “He’s doing this as a way … to begin to put this behind, not just him, but everybody else who’s been affected by this.”      Edwards’ attorneys say he’s been seeing Quinn and providing financial support for about a year, and just signed a child support agreement with Hunter. A spokesperson for Elizabeth Edwards says she learned last summer that Quinn is her husband’s child.      Why wait more than two years to publicly admit paternity?      “He has acknowledged it long before now. The reason it has taken so long for it to become public is thatthere were a lot of people involved,” Hickman said. “There are a lot of adults involved, there are a number of families involved, and there are also a lot of kids involved.”      Fall of the man who sought presidency      Today’s announcement marks another chapter in the fall of a man once considered a leading candidate for president. Edwards’ personal and political troubles began after the tabloid National Enquirer began reporting in October 2007 on his affair with Hunter, now 45.      In 2007, the National Enquirer began reporting that John Edwards had had an affair with Rielle Hunter. Edwards called the reports “lies.”      Edwards, who has been married to breast cancer survivor Elizabeth for 32 years, denied the affair at first. He called the claims “tabloid trash that’s full of lies.”      In 2008, after his failed presidential bid, Edwards eventually confirmed to ABC News that he had had an affair with Hunter, but he vehemently denied that he was the father of Hunter’s child.      “I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events,” Edwards told ABC News at the time.      Now Hickman says, “I do not know if he knew it was his daughter at the time, but I know he lied when he said it was not possible … I think he is certainly regretful of that.”      This campaign photo shows John Edwards with both his wife, Elizabeth (far left), and mistress, videographer Rielle Hunter (holding camera at right).      Edwards’ admission today also indicates that his relationship with Hunter continued months after his wife announced that her cancer had returned and that it was incurable.      Elizabeth Edwards is still undergoing cancer treatment and makes occasional appearances about health care. Last summer she opened a furniture shop in Chapel Hill, N.C., not far from the family’s mansion.      “Elizabeth thinks he should acknowledge this,” Hickman said. “It's been a very difficult time for everyone, but for Elizabeth, I think, more than anyone else, it's been a difficult time.”      Harrison Hickman, a close friend and adviser to John Edwards, spoke to NBC News on the former presidential candidate’s behalf.      Hickman said Edwards wanted to “do the right thing” and come clean in the summer of 2008, but that he couldn’t bring himself to do so.      “It was complicated … certainly more complicated than I knew,” Hickman explained. “He had to be able to talk to Elizabeth about it. He had to be able to talk to Rielle about it. He had to talk to us [and] his children about it. He had to deal with legal issues involving support for the child.”      Once the legal issues were resolved, Hickman said, Edwards “wanted to move forward immediately with letting people know about it.”      Hickman said he didn’t know the status of Edwards’ relationships with Hunter or his wife, but other family friends say John and Elizabeth have separated, at least for now, but still talk on a regular basis.      In a written statement to NBC News, John Edwards said it was wrong for him ever to deny the daughter he fathered with Rielle Hunter.      Edwards bought a house for Quinn and her mother to live in in Charlotte, N.C., more than two hours away from his home in Chapel Hill. Now, Hickman said, the former senator is trying to stay out of the public spotlight and focus his energy on family and doing good deeds like helping the poor. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"So, there was a man named John Edwards who once wanted to be the President of the United States. He did a bad thing by having a secret girlfriend named Rielle Hunter while he was married to his wife, Elizabeth Edwards. Rielle had a baby, and John didn't want people to know that he was the baby's daddy.  At first, he asked his friend Andrew to pretend to be the baby's daddy. Then, he took a long time to finally say, \\"Yes, I am the baby's daddy.\\" People were very disappointed with John for lying. Even his wife Elizabeth, who was very sick, was sad about what John did.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: King was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (nee Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Billie Jean's family was athletic. Her mother excelled at swimming, her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays. King's triumph at the French Open in 1972 made her only the fifth woman in tennis history to win the singles titles at all four Grand Slam events, a \\"career Grand Slam.\\" King also won a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. In women's doubles, only the Australian Open eluded her.  King won a record 20 career titles at Wimbledon - six in singles, 10 in women's doubles, and four in mixed doubles.  King played 51 Grand Slam singles events from 1959 through 1983, reaching at least the semifinals in 27 and at least the quarterfinals in 40 of her attempts. King was the runner-up in six Grand Slam singles events. An indicator of King's mental toughness in Grand Slam singles tournaments was her 11-2 career record in deuce third sets, i.e., third sets that were tied 5-5 before being resolved.  King won 129 singles titles, 78 of which were WTA titles, and her career prize money totaled US1,966,487.  In Federation Cup finals, King was on the winning United States team seven times, in 1963, 1966, 1967, and 1976 through 1979. Her career win-loss record was 52-4. She won the last 30 matches she played, including 15 straight wins in both singles and doubles. In Wightman Cup competition, King's career win-loss record was 22-4, winning her last nine matches. The United States won the cup ten of the 11 years that King participated. In singles, King was 6-1 against Ann Haydon-Jones, 4-0 against Virginia Wade, and 1-1 against Christine Truman Janes.  In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7-5, 5-4 (40-0) before saving three match points to win the second set 7-6(2) and then the third set 6-3. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"I can't recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4-5 and love-40, I told myself, 'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.'\\" In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to become the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King's first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2-0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn't have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.\\" Two days later in the semifinals, which was King's 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3. King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games.  She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \\"I'm not going to sweat in this match.\\"  King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. The final official singles match of King's career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open.  Before the start of the open era in 1968, King earned US100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the USLTA's practice of \\"shamateurism\\", where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism. King said this about the amateur game,  In America, tennis players are not people. If you are in tennis, you are a cross between a panhandler and a visiting in-law. You're not respected, you're tolerated. In England, you're respected as an artist. In Europe, you're a person of importance. Manuel Santana gets decorated by Franco. The Queen leads the applause. How many times have I been presented at the White House? You work all your life to win Wimbledon and Forest Hills and all the people say is, \\"That's nice. Now what are you going to do with your life?\\" They don't ask Mickey Mantle that. Stop 12 people on the street and ask them who Roy Emerson is and they're stuck for an answer, but they know the third-string right guard for the Rams. I'd like to see tennis get out of its \\"sissy\\" image and see some guy yell, \\"Hit it, ya bum\\" and see it be a game you don't have to have a lorgnette or a sash across your tuxedo to get in to watch.

Sentence 1: \\"The man couldn't lift his son because he was so weak.\\"  Sentence 2: \\"The son was so weak.\\" Is sentence 2 true, based on sentence 1?","output":"Yes, sentence 2 is true based on the information given in sentence 1. In sentence 1, we are told that \\"the man couldn't lift his son because he was so weak.\\" The use of the word \\"he\\" is a pronoun that refers to one of the two males mentioned in the sentence – the man or his son. In this case, the context suggests that \\"he\\" is referring to the man, meaning that the man was too weak to lift his son. However, we must also acknowledge that sentence 1 does not explicitly give any details about the son's physical state. It is possible for a weak person to lift another person who is also weak, as long as the person being lifted is not too heavy for the person doing the lifting. In this specific scenario, the son's level of weakness is not the factor that directly determines the man's inability to lift him. Thus, we can say that sentence 2 (\\"The son was so weak\\") is true based on the assumption that the man's weakness is at least partly attributable to the son's weakness. However, this conclusion would not be definite based on sentence 1 alone, as it does not directly comment on the son's level of strength."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Billy Behan is a poor teenage boy from the Bronx.  One day he catches the attention of gangster Dutch Schultz.  Changing his last name to Bathgate, after a local street, he goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a gopher for Schultz.  Billy is present when Schultz murders his former partner Bo Weinberg, who Schultz believes betrayed him. Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston. Facing legal charges in a court in upstate New York, Schultz brings Billy and Drew along.  He successfully charms the locals, presenting himself as charming and good natured.  While his boss Dutch stands trial, Billy's job is to watch over Drew.  His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew.

Joseph had always hated kids.; b). Nelson had always hated kids.;","output":"Nelson had always hated kids. Growing up, Nelson had never liked being surrounded by children. All the noise, the chaos, and the constant supervision they required frustrated him. He was more of a solitary person, calm and composed, while kids were – well, little storm clouds creating havoc wherever they went. Joseph, on the other hand, was the kind of person who could effortlessly walk into a room full of kids and have them hang onto every word he said. He knew how to guide them with patience and kindness, and he somehow managed to make every learning experience enjoyable and engaging. Joseph and Nelson had been friends since childhood, and they had decided to pursue teaching as a career, both hoping it would help them make a positive impact on the lives of young people. As the teaching course progressed, it became more and more evident that Nelson's initial misgivings about dealing with kids weren't going to fade away. During his required in-class training, he found it difficult to connect with the students, often leaving him frustrated and disheartened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't see the innate potential and curiosity in them that Joseph seemed to so effortlessly discover. One day, after a particularly difficult training session, Nelson confided in Joseph about his struggles. He felt that perhaps teaching wasn't the right path for him after all. A concerned Joseph listened carefully and pondered over his friend's dilemma. After giving it some thought, he suggested that maybe Nelson could benefit from observing his techniques and methods, hoping it would give him the confidence and inspiration he needed to thrive as a teacher. Over the next few weeks, Nelson accompanied Joseph to his training sessions. He watched intently as Joseph effortlessly captured the attention of his students, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie and warmth in the classroom. The kids would listen intently, engaging with the material, and asking questions that clearly showed they wanted to learn more. It was truly inspirational. Inspired by his friend's approach, Nelson began to adopt some of Joseph's strategies. He tried being more patient with the students, seeking ways to engage them by tapping into their interests and personalities. Rather than just focusing on the subject matter, Nelson started to prioritize building a rapport with the students, recognizing their individuality and potential. Slowly but surely, Nelson began to see a change in himself. The knot of frustration that used to occupy his chest every time he entered a classroom started to loosen. The students were opening up to him and, to his surprise, he found himself enjoying their company. His new approach was paying off, as the kids were responding positively to his efforts, and for the first time, Nelson recognized that he, too, could make an impact on their lives. Although it was a slow and arduous process, Nelson's perseverance and the unwavering support of his friend, Joseph, helped him transcend his initial feelings of disdain towards children. Ultimately, he became a dedicated teacher who took pride in helping shape the minds and hearts of young people. Joseph and Nelson’s commitment to teaching went beyond just fulfilling their professional pursuits. It became a representation of their strong bond and a testament to how even the most ingrained beliefs can change with the right mindset and influence. United in their passion and respect for education, they went on to make lasting and meaningful contributions to the lives of countless students, proving that sometimes even the most unlikely person can turn adversity into a flourishing and fulfilling existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs.\\" In this premise, we have a few important pieces of information: 1. There are two bronze elephants. 2. The elephants are positioned on statues of tortoises. 3. The elephants are flanking, or positioned on either side of, the steps that lead to the courtyard. 4. The elephants have riders on their backs who are in a praying position. Now let's break down the hypothesis: \\"The bronze elephants stand alone in the center of the empty courtyard.\\" This hypothesis presents us with three new pieces of information about the elephants: 1. They are alone. 2. They are situated in the center of the courtyard. 3. The courtyard is empty. By comparing the premise to the hypothesis, we find that they do not align in key ways. The first discrepancy is the placement of the elephants. According to the premise, the elephants flank the steps leading to the courtyard, while the hypothesis claims that the elephants are in the center of the courtyard. These positions cannot simultaneously be true since the steps to the courtyard and the center of the courtyard are two distinct locations. Another inconsistency lies in the air of emptiness that the hypothesis describes. The empty courtyard would suggest that there are no other items or features within the space. However, the premise clearly states that the elephants stand on statues of tortoises and have riders on their backs. This information contradicts the hypothesis's depiction of an empty courtyard with standalone elephants. Since the premise and the hypothesis contain conflicting information regarding the placement of the bronze elephants and the contents of the courtyard, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Emily didn't like to work in the yard but Cynthia found it pleasing.","output":"While Emily eschewed yard work, preferring indoor activities that were far removed from the mess of the outdoors, Cynthia found a strange sense of peace in it. It wasn't just about digging through the earth and planting seeds for Cynthia. It was much more profound than that. Yard work, for her, was a tangible expression of the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature; a confirmation of life's enduring cycles.  Every time Cynthia would plunge her spade into the cool, crumbly earth, she would be reminded of the intricate cycles that allowed such a simple act to bring forth life. She would imagine the seed, seemingly lifeless, buried in the darkness. Despite its humble beginnings, it would soon shoot forth, breaking the surface of the soil, zealously reaching for the warmth and light of the sun. This sense of continuity, this blend of mystery and miracle that was encapsulated in the act of gardening, was something that Emily found hard to comprehend. Emily, meanwhile, found her peace in more polished environs. She loved the clean lines of a well-organized office or the predictable click-clack of a keyboard. In the pragmatic rhythm of her daily tasks, Emily saw the comforting patterns of human order. There was no room for the surprises of nature, the dirt under your fingers, or the uncertainty that came with every planted seed.  Everything Emily did had a tangible result, an immediate product. She spent her days creating reports and plans, organizing events, and building strategies to navigate the complexities of the business world. She loved the predictability of it all, the fact that she could control the variables and influence the outcome. In contrast, Cynthia's gardening seemed messy and unpredictable to her, a slave to the weather and the whims of the seasons. Emily had tried multiple times to find joy in yard work, attempting to understand what Cynthia found so pleasing. But each time, she ended up frustrated and disenchanted. She understood that nature had its own rhythm, its own pace that refused to bow down to human whims. This unpredictability, the uncertainty of whether a plant would bloom or die, was something that Emily found difficult to accept. Cynthia, however, loved the unpredictability that came with gardening. The patience required, the understanding of nature's cycles, the accepting of failure and rejoicing in success, was something that Cynthia found immensely gratifying. When she worked in the yard, she felt a free-flowing exchange of energy, a completeness that no indoor activity could provide. Their different outlooks created interesting dynamics between Emily and Cynthia. Yet, it was these differences that also allowed them to harmonize their lives, like two sides of a coin. They didn't need to like the same things. That was the beauty of it. Emily didn't have to enjoy working in the yard, just as Cynthia didn't have to enjoy working indoors. And so, their lives continued. Emily, with her love for indoor predictability, and Cynthia, with her passion for the outdoor uncertainty. It was an unspoken agreement, a mutual understanding, that made their coexistence not just possible, but also enjoyable. After all, what better way to enjoy life than by embracing one's differences, while respecting the passions and predilections of others?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Calling itself the Land League, the group has become embroiled in a campaign to stop an Irish bank from repossessing the home of a high-profile lawyer. The mansion, overlooking Dublin bay, sits within a seaside suburb so packed with Ireland's rich and famous that the tabloid press have dubbed it Bel Ã‰ire. The ostentatious address is an unusual setting for an anti-austerity campaign. The disputed mansion, on Vico Road, Killiney, is the family home of the solicitor and property developer Brian O'Donnell. It boasts a swimming pool and tennis courts. Before the crash, its owner built up a significant international property portfolio, but failed investments have left him with massive debts. But the family's decision to enlist the support of the Land League has added further intrigue to their fight to keep their mansion. The campaign group has tried to evoke a 19th Century movement that supported Irish tenant farmers facing rising rents and evictions by landlords who often lived outside Ireland. The original Land League was set up by Michael Davitt in 1879.  He was born into poor tenant farming family in County Mayo at the height of Ireland's Great Famine. Unable to pay their rent, his family was evicted from their farm and emigrated to England. By the age of 11, Davitt was working in a Lancashire cotton mill, where he lost an arm in an industrial accident. On his return to Ireland as an adult, he saw that conditions had improved little for tenant farmers, and he led a campaign against the rising rents demanded by wealthy absentee landlords. Davitt became secretary of the Land League and the nationalist statesman, Charles Stewart Parnell, agreed to lead it as president. On its website, the new Land League quotes Parnell: \\"When a man takes a farm from which another had been evicted you must shun him on the roadside.\\" The group first grabbed the media's attention in July 2013, when its members disrupted a distressed property auction in Dublin - a fire sale of Celtic Tiger folly. The group's spokesman, Jerry Beades, said the Irish public still associated forced evictions with Davitt's Land League, and when a Parnell speech was quoted at the forcibly abandoned auction, they decided to adopt the name. The league's main aim is to stop evictions in the Republic of Ireland and it has called on the banks to allow homeowners to make \\" realistic\\" repayments. Most Irish anti-austerity protests have focused their anger on the banks, but  property developers, to whom the banks lent recklessly, rarely escape their wrath. So, the sight of anti-austerity protesters campaigning to keep a property developer in his multi-million euros mansion has prompted much comment in the media. Writing in the Irish Independent, the economist David McWilliams said it was \\"less easy to feel sorry for the O'Donnell family's plight than it is for much poorer people\\" who are facing eviction from \\"much less salubrious\\" houses. However, Mr Beades told the same newspaper that the O'Donnells are \\"no different\\" to any other family facing repossession action. \\"When the Land League was first formed, there were big farmers thrown off land as well as small tenant farmers. They all stuck together.\\" He added: \\"Whether you owe 50,000 euros or 5m euros, the issues are the same.\\" In an interview with the BBC, Mr Beades said nearly half a million people in the state had debts they could not service. He said the O'Donnells had already paid back millions to Irish banks but Bank of Ireland was \\"trying to pursue them to ends of the earth\\". The Irish public would be \\"shocked\\" by the sight of a \\"masked receiver\\" nailing an eviction order to the gates of a family home, the league's spokesman said. Many Irish farmers have suffered a similar fate in recent years, but the media has not been interested in their plight, he added. When asked how many lower-profile cases the Land League had become involved in, Mr Beades said they have provided advice to \\"hundreds of families\\" facing eviction. He said in the last year alone, they have successfully resisted 10 evictions, where families have stayed in their homes.  He added the group had \\"confronted\\" bailiffs in 10 other repossession cases. Mr Beades said he had been inside plenty of homes during eviction proceedings and the current atmosphere in the O'Donnell house was the just the same - difficult. He said several further court hearings were pending and added that the Land League intends to see the Gorse Hill case out \\"to the end\\". What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a group called the Land League, which is trying to stop a bank in Ireland from taking away the home of a lawyer named Brian O'Donnell. The Land League wants to help people who are not able to pay their debts and might lose their homes. People have different opinions about this situation because the home is very big and fancy, and the lawyer is not poor like some other people facing the same problem. The Land League says they just want to help all families in need, no matter how much money they have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — In the face of a storm of controversy and a slew of challengers, U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election.      This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican.      \\"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening.      Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using 84,000 in taxpayer funds.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement.      The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold.      The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination.      Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \\"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\\"      All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career.      Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary.      Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C.      Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign.      Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment.      Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out.      But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior.      In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation.      Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him.      The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.      Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble.      Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest.      A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\\"      And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson.      “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.”      “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.”      Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery      WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \\"sexualized commentary\\" in his Capitol Hill office.      The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint.      ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims      The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office.      Now Playing:      Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress.      Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for 84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay.      Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \\"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\\" she said on CNN Thursday.      Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit.      Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican.      Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \\"poor performance.\\"      Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint.      Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold.      SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation      Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation.      Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing.      The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now.      \\"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case.      After details of their 84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute.      But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March.      Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact.      In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \\"sexual fantasies\\" and \\"wet dreams\\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her.      Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \\"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\\"      Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \\"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\\"      Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \\"anger issues.\\"      She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized.      Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter.      According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \\"differently.\\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \\"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\\"      The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \\"nothing to add.\\"      In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \\"independent investigative team\\" to address the two women's concerns.      \\"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement.      \\"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\\" Daniels said.      Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \\"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\\"      Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \\"full compliance with office policy and the law.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’”      Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said.      As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an 84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation.      A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work. |||||","output":"US Representative Blake Farenthold continues to campaign for re-election in the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment and the use of 84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a lawsuit in the past. As the scandal continues, five Republicans and at least four Democrats have launched campaigns to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional District. Despite calls for his resignation from party members, Farenthold's advisers remain supportive, citing previous investigations that found charges against him \\"unfounded.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tasapainoinen politiikka, jossa toisaalta painostetaan Irania kunnioittamaan demokraattisia vapauksia ja ihmisoikeuksia sekä tarkkaillaan tämän toteutumista ja toisaalta kannustetaan Irania kehittämään suhteita Euroopan unioniin, on ainoa toimiva tapa luoda molemminpuolisen luottamuksen ilmapiiri ja lopettaa keskinäinen kilpailu sekä luopua yksipuolisesta strategisesta lähestymistavasta alueen ongelmien ratkaisemiseen. Translate this to English?","output":"A balanced policy, where on one hand Iran is pressured to respect democratic freedoms and human rights while monitoring its implementation, and on the other hand encouraging Iran to develop relations with the European Union, is the only viable way to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and end mutual competition as well as abandon unilateral strategic approaches to solving the region's problems. In order to achieve a more peaceful and stable geopolitical situation in the region, it is essential to have a balanced and comprehensive policy in place. This includes pressuring Iran to comply with international norms and rules, particularly in terms of democratic freedoms and human rights. Ensuring that Iran respects these norms and standards leads to the reinforcement of its democratic institutions and the empowerment of its civil society, both of which are crucial for the long-term stability of the country. At the same time, it is also important to encourage Iran to foster closer ties with the European Union. By deepening its relationship with the EU, Iran can benefit from increased economic, political, and cultural cooperation, which can help bolster its development efforts and improve the stability of its political system. Furthermore, engaging with Iran in a constructive and collaborative manner, rather than adopting an antagonistic or hostile approach, can help promote understanding and mutual trust between Iran and other countries in the region. Monitoring the progress of Iran's commitments to democratic freedoms and human rights is an important aspect of this policy. It is essential to establish a transparent and comprehensive monitoring mechanism to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its actions, as well as to report on any progress that is made in these areas. This can help maintain pressure on Iran to continue making positive reforms, while also providing valuable information to the international community on Iran's commitments to democracy and human rights. Abandoning unilateral strategic approaches to solving the region's problems is another critical component of this policy. This means that countries should avoid adopting policies that ignore the needs, perspectives, and interests of other key regional players, and instead work towards common goals and objectives. Unilateral actions often result in further tensions and hostilities, whereas cooperation and dialogue can lead to peaceful and lasting solutions to conflicts and disputes in the region. In conclusion, a balanced policy that pressures Iran to respect democratic freedoms and human rights while encouraging it to develop closer ties with the EU, and monitoring the implementation of its commitments, is the most effective way to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and end mutual competition in the region. Furthermore, abandoning unilateral strategic approaches and fostering cooperation and dialogue among all relevant stakeholders is crucial for achieving long-term peace and stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the album released in 2002 by the band that played at Lollapalooza in 1994? ?  In 1993, the Breeders released their second album, Last Splash. At this time, the group's lineup  consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together. Throughout 2014, Wiggs traveled from her home in Brooklyn, New York to Dayton, Ohio, near where Macpherson and both Deals lived. The group began practicing new material in Kim Deal's basement, including compositions by her and one by Wiggs. By August, there were three new songs they could play well, two less so, and others they had not yet practiced. Reported titles were \\"Skinhead #2\\", \\"Simone\\", \\"All Nerve\\", and \\"Launched\\". The band Neutral Milk Hotel asked the Breeders to open for them at a Hollywood Bowl concert to be held on September 18. The latter decided to go on tour leading up to this show and to perform some new compositions in preparation for their eventual recording.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items.  Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism.  Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen.  Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\".

Article:An arrest warrant was issued for Iraq's most senior Sunni Arab politician on Monday on terrorism charges. Mr Hashemi denies the charges and his entire political bloc is boycotting parliament and the cabinet. Tensions between Sunnis and the Shia Arab majority appear to be coming to a head, a BBC correspondent says. Mr Hashemi is currently in Irbil, under the protection of the Kurdistan regional government. The warrant was issued a day after US troops pulled out of Iraq. US Vice-President Joe Biden has urged Iraqi leaders to work together to avert renewed sectarian strife. By Jim MuirBBC News Among the Iraqis, the Kurds alone can mediate between the country's feuding Sunni and Shia Arab leaders. They are bound to renew that key role in the coming days of intense efforts to revive - or perhaps revise - the national entente formula. In recent years, the Americans would have been expected to head off such a rift long before it happened. The White House has said it is deeply concerned by the current crisis and has been in touch with all sides. Its ability to continue playing a major role in the Iraqi political arena in the post-withdrawal period is thus faced with an immediate test, but the Iraqi perception is that US influence is now much diminished. The crisis may also give clues as to how hard Tehran will seek to push its advantage and exploit the perceived vacuum left by the American withdrawal. Rift endangers unity government Mr Maliki, a Shia Arab, said on live TV that he would dismiss ministers belonging to Mr Hashemi's bloc, al-Iraqiyya, if they did not lift their boycott. He invited all political factions to hold talks to try to resolve the crisis. Otherwise, he said, Iraq could in future have a majority government which any person or bloc would be welcome to join to \\"take the country forward in a positive direction\\". In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, al-Iraqiyya rejected the invitation to talks, saying Mr Maliki himself was \\"the main reason for the crisis and the problem\\". Asked about Mr Hashemi's call for the Arab League to oversee any investigation into the allegations, Mr Maliki said this was a criminal issue in Iraq. He saw no reason why the Arab League or the UN should intervene in an Iraqi criminal case, he said. \\"We do not accept any interference in Iraqi justice,\\" he added. \\"We gave Saddam a fair trial, and we will give Hashemi a fair trial too.\\" Mr Hashemi denies allegations that he funded attacks on government and security officials during Iraq's bloody insurgency. On Monday evening, Iraqi television showed purported confessions from his bodyguards, but the vice-president says that they were false and \\"politicised\\". He told reporters in Irbil on Tuesday: \\"I swear to God that I never committed a sin when it comes to Iraqi blood.\\" He said he would be willing to face trial in Kurdistan. Mr Maliki went on TV after speaking on the phone to Mr Biden. The US vice-president \\"stressed the urgent need for the prime minister and the leaders of the other major blocs to meet and work through their differences together\\", the White House said. Mr Maliki leads a government of national unity in a fragile power-sharing deal that has lasted a year. Iraq has a majority Shia population, but the areas adjacent to the Syrian border are almost entirely Sunni-dominated. BBC Middle East correspondent Jim Muir says Sunni-majority provinces which had previously shown little interest in setting up Kurdistan-style autonomous areas have begun to embrace that idea. This worries the prime minister, who fears an alliance between Sunni areas of Iraq and a possible future Sunni-controlled Syria, should the government of Bashar al-Assad fall, our correspondent adds. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"An arrest warrant was issued for a very important Sunni Arab politician in Iraq named Mr. Hashemi.

Banned: David Bradley, 55, cannot teach for at least two years after he. admitted streaking across a field with a group of year 8 pupils (file picture) A grammar school teacher who streaked naked in front of his pupils has been banned from Britain's classrooms for at least two years. Education Secretary Michael Gove imposed the sanction on David Bradley, 59, after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at North Cestrian Grammar School, in Altrincham, Cheshire. Bradley, who received an MBE four years. ago for his work with children on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, quit his job last month after admitting it had been. ‘inappropriate’ to streak. He had been camping with the group of 12-and 13-year-olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden. The married teacher told a disciplinary panel: ‘The lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying, “Come on sir, you have a go.” ‘At that point, for whatever reason, I got up, ran down the garden and ran back in. Even when I did it I thought, “What am I doing?”’ The Teaching Agency, who announced the ban today said: 'We are satisfied on the evidence that he took the conscious decision to agree to streak, then moved out of his sleeping bag, removed his boxer shorts and then ran with pupils in the garden. Bradley said that he could not explain why he had behaved in that way, but claimed that in November 2011 he was close to a breakdown due to stress and the pressure of work. Their report went on: 'Mr Bradley confirmed that there were no complaints raised by any children, and the children had found it hilarious.' Recommending he should be struck off the disciplinary panel said: 'Teachers are expected to behave in a manner which ensures the maintenance of appropriate professional boundaries. 'We believe that your actions in engaging in the streak failed to maintain the clear boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour which should exist between pupils and teachers. Your behaviour failed to ensure the maintenance of appropriate boundaries which are essential in order to ensure that a teacher's position of trust, responsibility and authority are upheld.' Bradley had undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the Solwaybank centre in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011. The veteran teacher, from Hale Barns in Greater Manchester, was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he taught. However, the Teaching Agency hearing in Coventry ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl, who Bradley said was hypothermic, did not amount to misconduct. Respected: Four years ago Mr Bradley was handed an MBE but has now left North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham in disgrace after the school trip. The English master was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services. to young people after running schemes for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. for 30 years. He said at the time that organising. trips was ‘normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal. vitality the young exude’. Bradley, who has taught for 37 years, said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional. However, referring to the accusations. about hugging the girl,  Bradley said he was ‘aghast’ that what used to. be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints. ‘The thing that comes out of this is how out of date I am,’ he said. ‘What is viewed as normal today seems. to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult can’t be near to. a child without being accused of something. I’m aghast.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In February 2013, David Bradley, a 59-year-old grammar school teacher, was banned from teaching in Britain for at least two years after streaking naked in front of his pupils during a school camping trip to the Solwaybank center in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more igneous rocks break down, it will have no direct effect on the cooling of lava. The breakdown of igneous rocks and the cooling of lava are two separate processes. The breakdown of igneous rocks usually occurs due to weathering and erosion, while the cooling of lava happens when molten rock, or magma, reaches the Earth's surface and loses heat to the atmosphere. However, if we consider the broader context, the breakdown of igneous rocks contributes to the production of soil and sediment. This sediment can be carried by rivers and other geological processes to different areas, potentially affecting the landscape. These changes in the landscape could, in turn, influence local geological conditions and processes like tectonic activity or magma formation, but this would occur over a very long timescale and would not directly influence the cooling of lava."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the below context:  Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.

The star — which only has the scientific designation of EBLM J0555-57Ab — is located about 600 light-years from Earth and can be seen from the Southern Hemisphere — if you look through a large telescope.      \\"I was a little surprised to find one this small,\\" Amaury Triaud, co-author of the paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics on Wednesday, told CBC News.      Astronomers searching for exoplanets, which orbit other stars, came across the star in one of their surveys. This is part of the team that discovered the TRAPPIST-1 system, another small and dim star that has seven planets, three of which hold the best chance for finding life outside our solar system, something that Triaud, who is a senior researcher at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, still believes to be true.      An artist's illustration of the seven new planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. (European Southern Observatory)      The team focuses mainly on exoplanets, using the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey, telescopes that look for minute dips in a star's brightness that may indicate a planet is crossing in front of it.      But sometimes stars pass in front of another star as part of a two-star system. Astronomers have catalogued 200 of these binary systems using WASP.      Initially, the astronomers thought that it was an exoplanet. The star is 2,000 to 3,000 times fainter than our own sun. However, upon collecting more data, they realized that the mass indicated it had to be a tiny, dim star.      Astrophysicists believe that starting fusion — where gravity creates high pressure and temperatures that change hydrogen atoms into helium atoms — can only be done at a particular mass. And this new star is massive enough to do that.      Extreme close-up      The small star is just slightly larger than Saturn, or 80 per cent the size of Jupiter, with a radius of 49,000 kilometres. It also has 85 times the mass of Jupiter: if you could stand on the star, the gravity would be 300 times Earth's.      When there are two stars in a system, they orbit around the same spot, called the barycentre. And this newly discovered baby star is so close to its companion — 10 times closer than Mercury is to our sun — that it takes just seven days to orbit the shared barycentre.      It's like trying to look at a candle beside a lighthouse. - Amaury Triaud , University of Cambridge      In a typical binary system, there is a separation between two stars that is larger than our solar system, Triaud said, somewhere between 100 and 1,000 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the sun, about 150 million kilometres). In this case, Triaud noted, it's only eight per cent of an astronomical unit.      The star is not only small, it's much cooler than many of the gas giant exoplanets that have been discovered.      \\"That star likely represents the smallest natural fusion reactor that we know of,\\" Triaud said. \\"We're trying to replicate fusion on Earth in labs, but that's basically as small as it gets in nature.\\"      The mass of this star is much like TRAPPIST-1, but it is 30 per cent smaller.      TRAPPIST-1 is about the size of Jupiter, far smaller than our sun. (European Southern Observatory)      The astronomers will continue to study the star, where among other things, they will attempt to determine how much light the star emits. It's somewhat difficult to study this dwarf star due to the companion star's brightness.      \\"It's like trying to look at a candle beside a lighthouse,\\" Triaud said.      The team hopes this will shed some light on some of the most abundant stars in our universe.      \\"It shows how many different objects exist in the universe,\\" Triaud said.      \\"Most of the stars have the mass less one-quarter that of the sun … although it's a bit on the smaller range, but it's part of the smallest stars that exist, which are the most common stars that exist. And it's odd that we know so little about the most common stars in the universe.\\" ||||| Credit: Amanda Smith The smallest star yet measured has been discovered by a team of astronomers led by the University of Cambridge. With a size just a sliver larger than that of Saturn, the gravitational pull at its stellar surface is about 300 times stronger than what humans feel on Earth.      The star is likely as small as stars can possibly become, as it has just enough mass to enable the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. If it were any smaller, the pressure at the centre of the star would no longer be sufficient to enable this process to take place. Hydrogen fusion is also what powers the Sun, and scientists are attempting to replicate it as a powerful energy source here on Earth.      These very small and dim stars are also the best possible candidates for detecting Earth-sized planets which can have liquid water on their surfaces, such as TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool dwarf surrounded by seven temperate Earth-sized worlds.      The newly-measured star, called EBLM J0555-57Ab, is located about six hundred light years away. It is part of a binary system, and was identified as it passed in front of its much larger companion, a method which is usually used to detect planets, not stars. Details will be published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.      \\"Our discovery reveals how small stars can be,\\" said Alexander Boetticher, the lead author of the study, and a Master's student at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory and Institute of Astronomy. \\"Had this star formed with only a slightly lower mass, the fusion reaction of hydrogen in its core could not be sustained, and the star would instead have transformed into a brown dwarf.\\"      EBLM J0555-57Ab was identified by WASP, a planet-finding experiment run by the Universities of Keele, Warwick, Leicester and St Andrews. EBLM J0555-57Ab was detected when it passed in front of, or transited, its larger parent star, forming what is called an eclipsing stellar binary system. The parent star became dimmer in a periodic fashion, the signature of an orbiting object. Thanks to this special configuration, researchers can accurately measure the mass and size of any orbiting companions, in this case a small star. The mass of EBLM J0555-57Ab was established via the Doppler, wobble method, using data from the CORALIE spectrograph.      \\"This star is smaller, and likely colder than many of the gas giant exoplanets that have so far been identified,\\" said von Boetticher. \\"While a fascinating feature of stellar physics, it is often harder to measure the size of such dim low-mass stars than for many of the larger planets. Thankfully, we can find these small stars with planet-hunting equipment, when they orbit a larger host star in a binary system. It might sound incredible, but finding a star can at times be harder than finding a planet.\\"      This newly-measured star has a mass comparable to the current estimate for TRAPPIST-1, but has a radius that is nearly 30% smaller. \\"The smallest stars provide optimal conditions for the discovery of Earth-like planets, and for the remote exploration of their atmospheres,\\" said co-author Amaury Triaud, senior researcher at Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. \\"However, before we can study planets, we absolutely need to understand their star; this is fundamental.\\"      Although they are the most numerous stars in the Universe, stars with sizes and masses less than 20% that of the Sun are poorly understood, since they are difficult to detect due to their small size and low brightness. The EBLM project, which identified the star in this study, aims to plug that lapse in knowledge. \\"Thanks to the EBLM project, we will achieve a far greater understanding of the planets orbiting the most common stars that exist, planets like those orbiting TRAPPIST-1,\\" said co-author Professor Didier Queloz of Cambridge' Cavendish Laboratory.

'A Saturn-size low-mass star at the hydrogen-burning limit.' Astronomy & Astrophysics (2017). arXiv: arxiv.org/abs/1706.08781       ||||| Astronomers have discovered a star 600 light-years away that stretches the definition of what can even be considered a star. That's because EBLM J0555-57Ab, the smallest star ever discovered, is the size of a planet—specifically, it's just a hair bigger than Saturn.      But the star 57Ab is much more massive than Saturn. In fact, it's 85 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it just massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium and become a true star. Because of its small radius, though, it was initially caught up in a case of mistaken identity.      57Ab is part of a triple star system. While the sun-mass stars EBLM J0555-57A and EBLM J0555-57B orbit around each other, 57Ab orbits only the primary star. 57Ab's small size in comparison to its sun-like companions led researchers to conclude initially that the planet-sized star was just that, a planet. The star's mistaken classification occurred in part because it was detected by transit—the general method for finding exoplanets—where one body passes in front of another and dims some of the light from the background object.      Everything about the light curve suggested a planet. \\"Indeed, until we measured the mass it looked just like a transiting planet,\\" said Amaury Triaud, a Kavli Institute fellow at the University of Cambridge and an author on the paper published today in Astronomy and Astrophysics.      Current models suggest a big ball of gas has enough mass to ignite into a star at about 80 times the mass of Jupiter. To be considered a star, an object must undergo nuclear fusion in its core and fuse hydrogen into helium. Below 80 Jupiter masses, star-like objects are called brown dwarfs and only fuse hydrogen into the isotope deuterium.      So at 85 Jupiter masses, 57Ab is cutting it close to what can be considered a star. It's less than one percent the mass of the sun, and indeed, Triaud says the team has had trouble determining some information about the star as its light is completely blotted out by its larger companions.      It's also likely that 57Ab has always been this way, rather than having lost some of its mass to its host star, EBLM J0555-57A. That still doesn't quite explain how the system came into existence, though.      \\"It is not entirely clear how stars with very different masses, like in our case, can form so close to each other,\\" Triaud says. \\"One scenario is that the stars formed further apart and somehow got closer. One way to do that is if they had very eccentric orbits, early on. Tidal forces would then tend to reduce the distance between the stars and make their orbits more circular.\\"      The small size of 57Ab places it in a class of stars called ultracool stars. The most famous example is TRAPPIST-1, a Jupiter-sized star that is home to seven planets. (Triaud was part of the team that discovered this system.) They're ideal laboratories for studying planetary systems with giant telescopes—that is, if astronomers can manage to find them.      \\"It is a little ironic that those small stars are the most common stars in the cosmos, but because they are faint, we don't as much about them as we wish,\\" Triaud says. \\"This is why, in parallel to our investigations into planets orbiting ultracool stars, we are also investigating the stars themselves.\\"      Now that EBLM J0555-57Ab is officially the smallest star ever discovered, you can bet that more astronomers will be turning their telescopes to observe the strange Saturn-sized star and learn more about these mysterious ultracool objects, treading the line between planethood and stardom. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A team of international astronomers has discovered the smallest star known in our galaxy, EBLM J0555-57Ab, which has a radius just slightly larger than Saturn, about 80% the size of Jupiter, and 85 times the mass of Jupiter.

The two were found in a black 2000 Dodge Durango near the 208 mile marker. Sgt. Steve Jarrett with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said that after a brief stand-off with police, the driver shot the passenger, then herself.      Multiple media outlets are reporting that the victim has been identified as 49-year-old Sandra Barnett of Ellenwood, Ga., who was abducted Wednesday from her home. Barnett was reportedly kidnapped by her husband's mistress, according to Clayton County Police. The other woman's name has not been released.      Chief Deputy Brad Robinson of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office in Georgia said authorities began chasing the Durango after receiving a notification of the vehicle's description in connection with the abduction out of Clayton County.      \\"We were told the vehicle might be in the area as part of a possible kidnapping, with both the suspect and victim inside,\\" Robinson said.      Deputies with Carroll County spotted the Durango exiting a service station off Interstate 20, attempted to stop the vehicle and began a chase onto the Interstate.      Alabama authorities got notification around 11:30 a.m. of the chase, Jarrett said. Upon entering Alabama, Carroll County deputies dropped back into a support position, until the chase stopped near Heflin.      \\"I don't think any shots were fired by any law enforcement,\\" Robinson said.

(AP) — A woman was abducted by her husband's mistress in suburban Atlanta and then shot in what authorities called a murder-suicide after a freeway pursuit into Alabama, police said Thursday.      Sandra Barnett, 49, of Ellenwood, Georgia, was abducted from her home Wednesday, Clayton County Police Officer Charlene Fraser said. Clayton County police distributed a lookout bulletin for a black Dodge Durango the woman was taken away in, Fraser said.

The SUV stopped at mile marker 208 on a stretch of the freeway in Cleburne County, Alabama, and a standoff ensued, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokesman Steve Jarrett said in an emailed statement.      Fraser said the kidnapping suspect reached into the backseat, grabbed a gun and shot Barnett before shooting herself. Both women were dead inside the SUV when authorities approached it, Robinson said.      The abduction was reported by one of Barnett's relatives, Fraser said.

Today, we are going to talk about how to choose the best name for a horse. Now, you must be wondering why it's essential to give our horse friends a great name. Well, just like we have names that make us unique, our horse friends need names too. A good name can make a horse feel special, and, most importantly, helps us cheer for them when they race. So, let's learn how to pick an excellent horse name together! 1. Keep it short and sweet: The most important rule to remember when naming your horse is not to choose a name that is too long. Imagine trying to shout a name that's 18 letters long! That would be a struggle, right? So, pick a name that is easy to say and fun to yell out loud when cheering your horse on! 2. Be kind and respectful: We should always be polite and considerate to everyone, including our horse friends. So, we should avoid picking names that may hurt someone's feelings or be offensive. If you are unsure about a name, ask your parents or friends what they think, and remember that choosing a kind name is always best! 3. Stay away from some name categories: Sometimes, there are specific name categories we should avoid when naming our horse. For example, instead of picking names of historic victors (famous winners from the past), we can think of a new, creative name that will make our horse stand out. This way, our horse will have a unique and wonderful name we can be proud of! 4. Imagine cheering loudly: Your horse may participate in races, and, as we all know, races can be super exciting! So, when choosing a horse name, imagine shouting that name with hundreds of adoring fans all around you. If the name sounds great and complements the excitement, then congratulations! You've found the perfect name! 5. Be ready to explain the name: Lastly, our horse's name can be a head-turner, and people may wonder about its meaning. So, if the name is not easily understood, be prepared to explain why you chose it. For example, if you named your horse \\"Lightning Bolt\\" because of its incredible speed, tell people about it! They'll love to hear the exciting story behind the name. That's it, little friends! Remember these helpful tips when naming your horse, and have lots of fun doing it. The perfect name will make your horse feel loved and special, and that's what we all want for our animal friends. Happy naming!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: When was the last time you looked at the label on your clothes to check where they were made or what they are made of? A few years ago, I was living a paradox familiar to many Americans: eating local and organic food, carrying reusable bags to the grocery store and choosing eco-friendly products wherever I could. This mindfulness was in no way extended to my closet -- I owned more than 350 items of clothes, every single bit of it cheap, trendy, poorly made and assembled in low-wage factories in other countries. See the lifecycle of your cotton T-shirt. Fashion today has a here-today-gone-tomorrow mentality, where the latest look, lowest price or the hottest designer are paramount and quantity is valued over quality. For the first time in history, we are consuming clothes as a disposable good, buying a cheap dress for a date night and wearing it but once or twice. These changing attitudes prompted me to write my book, \\"Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,\\" and what I learned about the fashion industry during the process compelled me to change. Complete coverage: Fashion Week. Our consumption of clothing is growing at an alarming rate. Most Americans have closets brimming, if not overflowing with clothes. Few of those purchases are made here -- 3% of apparel is produced in the United States, down from about half in 1990. While American factories sit empty, our thirst for cheap imported clothing has kept the cash registers at many stores humming throughout the recession. Fashion's environmental footprint has also mushroomed. There are more than 80 billion garments produced around the world today, and according to a study by the UK's Cambridge University, the industry is creating 70 million tons of waste water as of 2006 in the UK alone. In China, the largest clothing manufacturer in the world, the textile industry is also a major polluter. Last year, I traveled undercover to southern China and saw smog enshrouding a landscape of factories and, more shockingly, hundreds of factory workers wearing cheap, trendy clothes. As China's consumer class grows, already-scarce resources like water and petroleum may soon buckle under all of this shopping. In July, when it came out that the Olympic uniforms were made in China, Americans were outraged, making it clear that we're growing weary of soulless consumption. I believe we're ready for more meaningful wardrobes, and to support our amazing clothing heritage. My mother recently gave me a dress that she wore in high school in the 1960s. It was made by Jonathan Logan, a juniors brand that was considered cheap for its day -- the dress is 100% wool, fully lined, finished with French seams and made in the USA. What's so wonderful about locally made fashion is that it offers designers tight control over their product, has a lower environmental footprint and makes it easier to keep an eye on any labor problems. And according to a Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor survey, approximately 55% of consumers agree it is \\"very/somewhat important\\" that their clothing is made in the U.S. I was recently in Portland, Oregon, and met with the owners of Spooltown and the Portland Garment Factory, two small shops that have opened recently in a city that had very little existing garment industry infrastructure. They were able to build profitable manufacturing businesses from scratch. Just imagine what other Americans cities could do with the right government and consumer support. Major fashion brands also have an obligation to dramatically reduce the amount of water and energy used and waste emitted in making and selling their clothes, as well as to offer consumers more stylish products that are made out of recycled and eco-friendly materials. Nike is creating athletic team uniforms out of recycled PET bottles and has recycled more than 28 million pairs of athletic shoes through their Reuse-a-Shoe program; Eileen Fisher has just released a beautiful line of bluesign-certified silk shirts dyed without hazardous chemicals; and H&M has agreed to stop using toxic and nonbiodegradable perfluorinated compounds, called PFCs, in their outerwear by 2013. These efforts need to be expanded. Clothing designers also need to rethink the materials they're using and how they're sourced. Fortunately, eco-friendly textiles have improved so much in recent years that luxurious eco-friendly fibers like Tencel, Modal and Cupro have far more in common with silk than a hemp sack. Some emerging designers are eschewing new textiles altogether for upcycling, which means taking waste and reclaimed textile material and turning it into a product with higher value. I recently bought a lovely red tunic upcycled from a men's dress shirt produced by a small Brooklyn designer called State. Designer on the rise: Mohapatra's moment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, we are throwing away 68 pounds of textiles per person per year and donating such a staggering volume of clothes that a majority of our donations to charity have to be sold to textile recyclers who then sell more than half of our used clothes overseas, largely to Africa. Retailers like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are accepting returns of their worn products -- Fisher resells them in her Green Eileen retail store, while Patagonia recycles theirs into new products. Fast-fashion stores need to start these types of recycling programs. Consumers can also take more responsibility by repairing and caring for the clothes they own, trading their duds at clothing swaps and, for the particularly creative, refashioning last year's styles into fresh looks. Now for the million-dollar question: How can you afford this? It all starts by taking an honest look at how you're spending money on clothes. The average American consumer spends 1,700 a year on apparel. Most of us own more clothing than we know what to do with, so I encourage people to first of all buy less clothing and to try to limit trendy, throwaway purchases to only one or two a season. Divert the rest of your clothing budget to clothes that you truly love and are going to wear for several seasons. If just a quarter of our purchases were put toward locally made or eco-friendly fashion and fashion companies with a commitment to sustainability, we could change the face of the industry. I also believe we'd be happier with our clothes. See what a cotton T-shirt goes through before it gets to you. Is your closet filled with cheap, disposable clothing?

Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, he escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing, the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever. The next day, 21-year-old Michael (Nick Castle), now wearing a mechanic's uniform and a white mask, returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after she drops off a key at his old house (where the murder took place) so her father can sell it. Her two best friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismiss Laurie's concerns that someone is following her. Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael. When Annie's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up, she takes Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) to the Doyle house, just across the street, to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Michael strangles Annie after she gets into her car.

Question: The answer to the question: What composition premiered in March 1905? is inside the article: Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside., can you guess it ?

His only hope is that his lawyers can persuade the serial killer Richard Ramirez to confess to the crime instead. His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess. She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him. As a child, she lived in the same neighborhood as one of Ramirez's notorious crimes, and she was obsessed with his crime spree, which was one of her inspirations to become a lawyer., what would be the answer ?

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.  and the situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression.

Experts predict that total spending for the congressional midterms will approach 4 billion, putting it on par with the 3 billion \\"Cash for Clunkers\\" program in 2009 aimed at boosting auto sales.      \\"It's certainly had an impact on the bottom lines of many of these companies, particularly in the media area,\\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \\"It probably improved things for some of them at a critical time.\\"      Campaigns paid banks to handle their money, consultants to map out their strategies and media buyers to book their advertising. The biggest winners of all were broadcasters, which together are expected to rake in about 2.5 billion in ad revenue from federal, state and local campaigns, according to industry estimates.      One example is Sinclair Broadcasting of Hunt Valley, Md., which owns or operates 58 television stations nationwide, including many in Ohio, Kentucky and other battleground states. The company said last week that political ad revenue will top 41 million this year, a 35 percent increase from 2006.      The rising fortunes allowed Sinclair to announce a special dividend payment to shareholders for the first time since early 2009, when payments stopped as a result of the recession. Sinclair executives did not respond to a request to comment.      \\"It's helped everyone get back on their feet, because last year was terrible,\\" said Tony Lenoir, a broadcast industry analyst at SNL Kagan. \\"It's a really good thing there was a big election this year.\\"      Politics is their specialty            Much of the money spent on campaigns went to a relatively small number of media buyers, consultants and polling firms that specialize in politics, according to Federal Election Commission records. The records also show only part of the picture, because most political committees and independent groups have not submitted final reports. ||||| Campaign spending for the 2010 election cycle will probably surpass 4 billion, easily beating out the 2006 midterm total of 2.85 billion. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which permitted unions and corporations to spend without limit, is partly responsible for the surge. Will all that spending help stimulate the economy?      Probably not. For spending to give the economy a boost, the money has to come from some less productive use. Buying a car, for example, is better for the economy than stashing your money in a vault. (Starting your own business might be better still.) When an individual gives cash to a political campaign for, say, an attack ad, those dollars end up going to a television station or production company. That business might in turn use the money to purchase a new set of video cameras, and the manufacturer of those cameras might invest in the design of its products. In theory, that cascade of activity should help the economy to grow. But most analysts say the gains would be illusory, since campaign donations are likely to reflect shifts in consumption habits and nothing more. Most political donors wouldn't otherwise be hoarding that capital. If they weren't supporting their favorite candidates, they'd be going out for fancy dinners or buying iPads. The effect on GDP would be the same.      What about corporations and unions? Corporate donations may be a net minus for the economy when they come at the expense of more direct business investment. Target, for example, could be less inclined to build a new store in Gary, Ind., after having spent 150,000 to support a candidate for Minnesota governor. Those kinds of moves are bad for the economy, because investment dollars are very good at generating economic activity. (Corporate donors may view their expenditures as investments in beneficial economic policies, but that kind of stimulus is far too speculative for economists to measure.) Unions, for their part, don't really make those sorts of investments. Their political donations function more like shifts in consumer spending.      Advertisement            Even if all 4 billion in 2010 campaign spending came out from under mattresses across the country, the effect on our economy would be minimal. National GDP is 14 trillion (PDF), so 4 billion represents a mere 0.03 percent surge. (For comparison, the 2009 federal stimulus plan was 787 billion, or 5.6 percent of GDP.) If we generously assume that the overall effect of every dollar would double as it moved from buyer to seller, the 2010 election would grow the economy by 0.06 percent. To put that into perspective, most economists found last quarter's two-percent growth rate disappointing.      While campaign spending won't rescue the economy, it is a massive stimulus plan for local television stations. During most of the year, businesses have little trouble buying advertising time, even on short notice. The stations fill their available slots with low-cost, tentative commitments that can be pre-empted if someone comes in offering more money. But national political candidates, who desperately want their commercials to run in the days before an election, pay top rates to ensure that no one can bump them. If you called your local affiliate today, there's probably no amount of money that could buy you a slot. In addition, stations raise rates steadily throughout the campaign to squeeze as much money as they can out of their few remaining commercial spaces. The 3 billion to be spent on television ads this year will eclipse both the 2.4 billion in the 2006 midterms and the 2.7 billion during the last presidential election. As a result, some stations are ransoming their slots for two and a half times their 2008 prices.      Got a question about today's news? Ask the Explainer .

Restaurant 's space was bright (large windows facing the parking lot and street), uncluttered, and attractive (shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it).  I asked if we were to seat ourselves, and I was told that we were to order at the counter and that we could then seat anywhere we wanted to.  I try to get a few suggestions wherever I go not only to check for allergens, but also for good customer service; it never sits well with me if staff members aren't able to suggest anything off of the menu.  After hearing a few enthusiastic lunch suggestions from the cashier, I placed in our order: a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit toppings (peaches and berries) for Mom, and a combo of half a Reubenesque panini and a small mixed salad.  It took about fifteen minutes before the food arrived, which gave us time to chit-chat and this was when I noticed the restaurant's surroundings.  I thought it cool to be able to watch the two cooks prepare the orders behind the counter.  My Mom LOVED the waffle with the fresh fruit toppings!  Her plate arrived with two 4x4-inch waffles, one with peaches and the other with sliced strawberries, a slice of pineapple and an orange wedge, all sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Mom sensed something was missing, and after asking for whipped cream, she and the waffles were fast friends.  My small salad looked beautiful- mixed greens with glazed pecans, a few pear slices, and blue cheese crumbles, a slice of grilled foccacia bread and a side of citrus vinaigrette.  My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef, swiss cheese, fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny (Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away), but it was full of flavor.

Instructions: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Movie title: Goodbye, Mr. Chips Context: In 1920s Britain, Arthur Chipping is an established member of the teaching staff at the Brookfield School. He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.  I am facing a new situation today: People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists.

We have the equation: 0 = -1719*f + 1760*f - 41 First, we need to combine the terms with \\"f\\" in them: -1719*f and 1760*f.  Now, let's see what we get when we add those together: -1719*f + 1760*f = 41*f So, our equation now looks like this: 0 = 41*f - 41 Now, let's move the -41 to the other side of the equation to isolate the \\"f\\" term. We do this by adding 41 to both sides: 0 + 41 = 41*f - 41 + 41 This simplifies to: 41 = 41*f Now, we need to figure out what number \\"f\\" is.

Then slowly, the rocks broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. Finally stones, pebbles   and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Which of the following speeds up  the breaks of rocks most? A) Hot weather. B) Cold water. C) Sharp changes in temperature. D) More dead plants in the cracks.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For a long time being happy was considered something that just happened, and there was nothing special about it. Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless   in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights  . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged   when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults   and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. Question: The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to   _  . Options: A: train you to be perfect B: show you the way to be happy C: tell you how to act when you dislike a person D: teach you how to be popular among your friends The answer to this question is:","output":"B: show you the way to be happy Step-by-step justification: 1. The article discusses various ways and strategies to be happier in life, such as getting along with others, not being selfish, looking for good points in others, and being polite and friendly. 2. The article also emphasizes the importance of accepting your own imperfections and learning from mistakes to maintain happiness while trying to develop a good character. 3.

As one of Jesus Christ's Twelve Apostles, he played a crucial role in the early development of the Christian faith. Philip's life as an apostle began when Jesus called him to follow as a disciple. During his time with Jesus, Philip was known to have been instrumental in the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, as he helped provide the loaves of bread. This event has led to Philip's association with a basket of loaves and a tau cross - symbols often used to depict him in art and literature. After Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, Philip continued to preach the gospel. His ministry took him to various parts of the Roman Empire, including Hierapolis in Anatolia, where he met his death in 80 A.D. As a martyr for his faith, Philip was greatly honored by the early church, and his legacy continues to be celebrated today. Philip the Apostle has been canonized as a saint in the Pre-Congregation era, and his feast day is observed on different dates across various Christian denominations - 3rd November in the Eastern Orthodox Church, 1st May in the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Church, and 11th May in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. Over the centuries, many artists have portrayed Philip in their works, with one noteworthy example being Peter Paul Rubens' depiction in his \\"Twelve Apostles\\" series (c. 1611), which can be found in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Today, St. Philip is recognized as the patron saint of several places and professions, including Cape Felipe Pueblo and Uruguay; Verde; hatters; and pastry chefs. In conclusion, Philip the Apostle's life and ministry have had a lasting impact on the Christian faith across different denominations and regions. His dedication and selflessness in spreading the gospel, as well as his eventual martyrdom, have earned him veneration and respect in both religious and historical contexts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The story is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by the real-life Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain spent his childhood. Although the exact years the novel takes place are not explicitly stated, it is generally accepted that the events occur in the 1840s based on references to the culture, social norms, and historical events mentioned throughout the book. The story's time period is important to understand the societal and cultural context in which the characters lived. During the mid-1800s, the U.S. was undergoing significant changes, such as westward expansion, the gold rush, and the build-up to the Civil War. These events influenced the lives of people in small Midwestern towns like St. Petersburg, as well as contributed to the moral and religious aspects prevalent in Tom Sawyer's world. Throughout the novel, readers encounter various elements that reflect the historical period, such as the importance of the Mississippi River in the lives of the inhabitants, the presence of the Christian church in their communities, and the prevailing attitudes towards Jim, a run-away slave character from Twain's sequel, \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" Slavery was still legal during the time the story takes place, which is an important factor when considering the social environment of the region. Furthermore, the novel also introduces a detailed depiction of the daily life of children in the 19th-century Midwest. Tom's adventures include playing with his friends, attending church and school, and generally experiencing a slice of life during that era. The cultural norms of discipline, work, etiquette, and family life are woven into the development of various characters and their relationships, providing deep insights into this specific time period. In conclusion, \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" takes place in the mid-1800s in a fictionalized version of Hannibal, Missouri, during the pre-Civil War era. The historical context, social norms, and cultural aspects that are present throughout the book help to paint an accurate picture of life in the 19th-century Midwest, giving readers an immersive reading experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.  - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds.  - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope.  - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.  - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\")  is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae.  - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras  21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist.  - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.  - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species.  - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.  - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.  - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\".  - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) . However , the latter are now usually placed into a separate class , Isoetopsida . Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants , with small , scale - like leaves , homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves , branching stems ( usually dichotomous ) , and generally simple form .

Movie title: Thirst Movie plot: Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) is a Catholic priest who volunteers at the hospital, providing ministry to the patients. He is well respected for his unwavering faith and dedicated service, but he secretly suffers from feelings of doubt and sadness. Sang-hyun volunteers to participate in an experiment to find a vaccine for the deadly Emmanuel Virus (EV). Although the experiment fails, and Sang-hyun is infected with the seemingly fatal disease, he makes a complete and rapid recovery after receiving a blood transfusion. News of his marvelous recovery quickly spreads among the devout parishioners of Sang-hyunâs congregation, and they begin to believe that he has a miraculous gift for healing. Soon, thousands more flock to Sang-Hyunâs services. Among the new churchgoers are Kang-woo (Shin Ha-kyun), Sang-hyunâs childhood friend, and his family. Kang-woo invites his old friend to join the weekly mahjong night at his house, and there, Sang-hyun finds himself attracted to Kang-wooâs wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-bin). Sang-hyun later relapses into his illness and wakes in dire need of shelter from the sunlight, having become a vampire. At first, Sang-hyun feels a new-found vigor but soon he is aghast to find himself drinking blood from a comatose patient. After attempting to kill himself, Sang-hyun finds himself irresistibly drawn to human blood. To make matters worse, the symptoms of EV return and only seem to go away when he has drunk blood. Desperately trying to avoid committing a murder, Sang-hyun resorts to stealing blood transfusion packs from the hospital. Tae-ju, who lives with her ill husband and overprotective mother-in-law, Lady Ra (Kim Hae-sook), leads a dreary life. She is drawn to Sang-hyun and his odd new physicality, including his inability to resist his desires. The two begin an affair, but when Tae-ju discovers the truth about Sang-hyun, she retreats in fear. When Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, she turns him down, suggesting that they kill her husband instead.[5] When Sang-hyun's superior... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Thirst\\", breaking down Kate's resistance (Tae-ju) is central to the development of the relationship between her and Sang-hyun, the protagonist who has become a vampire. There are a few key ways in which this process unfolds: 1. Emotional connection: Sang-hyun's initial attraction to Tae-ju is strengthened by the emotional bond they form as a result of their similar feelings of entrapment and dissatisfaction with their lives. Both characters are unhappy: Sang-hyun with his crisis of faith and newfound vampire nature, and Tae-ju with her dull, controlled life. This mutual understanding and shared dissatisfaction with their lives form the basis of their emotional connection, making it easier for Sang-hyun to try and break down her resistance. 2. Physical attraction: Sang-hyun's transformation into a vampire brings about a noticeable change in his physicality, which draws Tae-ju to him. His newfound strength, agility, and sensuality pique her curiosity and make her feel attracted to him. This physical attraction, combined with their emotional connection, helps in breaking down her initial resistance towards him and towards the affair they eventually engage in. 3. Challenging her fears: When Tae-ju discovers the truth about Sang-hyun's vampirism, she initially retreats in fear. However, Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, offering her a chance to escape her dreary life and indulge in the freedom and passion she craves. By challenging her fears and offering her a way out, he manages to break down her resistance further. 4. Manipulation: Sang-hyun resorts to manipulation when he suggests that they kill Tae-ju's husband, Kang-woo. This plan appeals to Tae-ju's desire for freedom from her life and future with her husband as well as the overbearing presence of her mother-in-law. While this decision is morally dubious, it shows the extent to which Sang-hyun is willing to go to break down Tae-ju's resistance and keep her by his side. 5. Showing her the darker side: Throughout the course of the movie, Sang-hyun reveals the darker aspects of his nature to Tae-ju, as he struggles to maintain his humanity while grappling with his vampire instincts. By involving her in his world and making her a part of it, he makes it easier for her to accept him and break down any remaining resistance she may have had. In conclusion, breaking down Tae-ju's resistance in \\"Thirst\\" is achieved through various means: forming an emotional connection, enticing her with physical attraction, challenging her fears, manipulating her situation, and involving her in the darker aspects of Sang-hyun's world. Combining these methods, Sang-hyun is able to win her over, fully dismantle her resistance, and forge a deep bond with her – albeit leading to a series of morally ambiguous and ultimately tragic events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is responsible for converting light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The retina has multiple layers: innermost, middle, outer, etc. Step 2: Identify the relevant layers for rod cells Rod cells are one type of photoreceptor cells found in the retina. They are primarily responsible for vision in low-light conditions and for peripheral vision. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are located in the outer layer of the retina, while cones are concentrated in the central region, known as the fovea. Step 3: Locate the rod cells within the retina layers Rod cells are located in the outer nuclear layer of the retina, which is specifically responsible for housing the cell bodies of the photoreceptors. Rod cells are distributed throughout most of the retina, with a higher density in the peripheral areas. In summary, rod cells are mainly located in the outer nuclear layer of the retina and are predominantly distributed throughout the peripheral regions of the retina, providing low-light and peripheral vision capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.  - Christology (from Greek  \\"Khristós\\" and , \\"-logia\\") is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature and person of Jesus as recorded in the canonical Gospels and the epistles of the New Testament. Primary considerations include the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of God the Father. As such, Christology is concerned with the details of Jesus' ministry, his acts and teachings, to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in salvation. The views of Paul the Apostle provided a major component of the Christology of the Apostolic Age. Paul's central themes included the notion of the pre-existence of Christ and the worship of Christ as \\"Kyrios\\" (Greek: \\"Lord\\").  - The Unitarian Church of Transylvania is a church of the Unitarian denomination, based in the city of Cluj, Transylvania, Romania. Founded in 1568 in the Principality of Transylvania, it has a majority-Hungarian following, and is one of the 18 religious confessions given official recognition by the Romanian state.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The Polish Brethren (Polish: \\"Bracia Polscy\\") were members of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland, a Nontrinitarian Protestant church that existed in Poland from 1565 to 1658. By those on the outside, they were called \\"Arians\\" or \\"Socinians\\" (\\")\\", but themselves preferred simply to be called \\"Brethren\\" or \\"Christians,\\" and, after their expulsion from Poland, \\"Unitarians\\".  - Socinianism is a system of Christian doctrine named for Fausto Sozzini (Latin: Faustus Socinus), which was developed among the Polish Brethren in the Minor Reformed Church of Poland during the 16th and 17th centuries and embraced by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania during the same period.

All other cases she presents are based entirely upon anecdotal information. Her claim that 500-1,000 women served is entirely unsubstantiated. Leonard seems to accept the story of Loreta Velasquez even though her account has been disproven. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

We have the words \\"especially thin\\" which, in this context, likely implies that whatever is being discussed feels weak, lacking substance, or has been stretched too thin. 2. The phrase \\"stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time\\" suggests that the thinness lasts throughout the entire duration of the 80-minute period, which can be considered an extensive amount of time for whatever is being discussed. Based on the analysis, the phrase is focused on the lack of substance and the prolonged duration of the issue.

Solve 11*q - 13 = -2*q for q.","output":"To solve this linear equation, we can follow the steps below: Step 1: Start with the original equation: 11*q - 13 = -2*q Step 2: The goal is to isolate the variable \`q\`. To do this, we begin by moving -2*q from the right side to the left side of the equation in order to combine like terms. We add 2*q to both sides: 11*q + 2*q = -2*q + 2*q + 13 This simplification results in 13*q = 13 Step 3: Now we can isolate \`q\` by dividing both sides of the equation by 13: 13*q / 13 = 13 / 13  Once simplified, we have:  q = 1 Justification: These steps follow the principles of algebra for solving linear equations which involves the use of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This helps us find the value of the variable. Here, the variable is \`q\` and the solution to the equation 11*q - 13 = -2*q is q = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.\\" correctly answer the question of What theory did Erasmus Darwin outline in the 1790s?","output":"No, the statement \\"Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.\\" does not correctly answer the question of what theory Erasmus Darwin outlined in the 1790s. Instead, this statement refers to Georges Cuvier's opposition to Erasmus Darwin's ideas about evolution and the development of species. To answer the question, we must first discuss the theory proposed by Erasmus Darwin and then briefly address how Georges Cuvier reacted to the theory. Erasmus Darwin, a British naturalist, scientist, and physician, formulated early ideas related to evolution in the 1790s, significantly predating the theories proposed by his grandson Charles Darwin. In his notable work \\"Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life\\" (1794-1796), Erasmus Darwin outlined the concept of transmutation of species, hinting at the idea that species were not fixed but could change and evolve over time. Specifically, he suggested that all living organisms, including humans, had descended from a single common ancestor over millions of years, a process driven by environmental pressures and competition for resources. Erasmus Darwin's theory also included the idea of acquired characteristics, proposing that organisms could pass on traits they had acquired throughout their lifetime to their offspring, thus ensuring the improvement and adaptation of the species as a whole. This idea, which later came to be known as Lamarckism, after the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, was not universally accepted among scientists of the time. Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist, zoologist, and paleontologist, was a significant figure in the development of comparative anatomy and paleontology, and he strongly opposed the ideas put forth by Erasmus Darwin. Cuvier believed in the fixity of species, meaning that each species was created and remained unaltered throughout its existence. He argued that species' similarities were the result of their functional needs and the overarching design created by a higher power, rather than stemming from any shared evolutionary ancestry. Cuvier further contended that any drastic changes to an organism's morphology, as proposed by Erasmus Darwin, would render that organism unable to survive, reinforcing his stance on the immutability of species and the distinct separation between them. He sought to debunk the idea of evolution by showing that species were created with a specific, functional purpose, though his interpretation of the fossil record ultimately contributed to the eventual acceptance of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In conclusion, the statement provided does not directly answer the question about Erasmus Darwin's theory from the 1790s. Instead, the pertinent information would be that Erasmus Darwin proposed an early theory about the transmutation and evolution of species, suggesting that all living organisms descended from a single common ancestor and could pass on acquired characteristics to their offspring. Georges Cuvier contested this idea, emphasizing the fixity of species and their similarities due to functional requirements and intelligent design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is generally difficult to have dual citizenship of India and another country, due to the provisions for loss of Indian nationality when an Indian national naturalizes in another country (see \`\`Loss of citizenship'' above), and the requirement to renounce one's existing citizenships when naturalizing in India (see \`\`Naturalization'' above). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you have dual indian and british citizenship?","output":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that having dual citizenship of both India and the United Kingdom (British citizenship) is not permissible under the current laws and regulations of India. This difficulty arises because of two main factors: the provisions for the loss of Indian nationality upon acquiring citizenship in another country and the requirement to relinquish existing citizenship(s) when naturalizing in India. Firstly, the loss of Indian citizenship occurs when an individual who holds Indian nationality chooses to pursue naturalization in another country, such as the United Kingdom. The Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognize dual citizenship and therefore requires Indian citizens to give up their nationality when acquiring citizenship in another nation. Consequently, an individual who gains British citizenship would typically lose their Indian citizenship as per the Indian law. Secondly, acquiring Indian nationality through naturalization also necessitates the renouncement of one's existing citizenship(s). This process would involve renouncing British citizenship (if held) before naturalizing as an Indian citizen. Consequently, a British citizen who seeks to become an Indian national would need to give up their British citizenship in the process. In light of these legal provisions, obtaining and maintaining dual Indian and British citizenship is not feasible under the current regulations governing Indian nationality. Individuals who wish to hold citizenship in both countries may need to explore alternative options and consider the implications of choosing one citizenship over the other. It is essential to consult relevant authorities or legal experts on matters related to citizenship and immigration to ensure adherence to all laws and regulations in both countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The dog is outside. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, we can conclude the hypothesis that the dog is outside based on the given premise. The premise provided contains several contextual clues and environmental elements that support the hypothesis that the dog is indeed outside. First, the dog is described as playing with a golf ball. Playing is an activity that typically takes place outdoors, especially for a dog as they need an open space to run around, chase, and play with toys. Being outside allows a dog to have the space and freedom to engage in such playful behavior. Second, the mention of a small wooden fence also points towards the dog being outside. Wooden fences are usually found on the perimeter of a property, serving as a boundary between the property and neighboring areas. These fences are common in outdoor scenarios such as backyards, parks, or similar settings, and play a part in defining the spatial layout of these environments. Third, the beach setting also strongly supports the hypothesis that the dog is outside. Beaches are clearly natural outdoor environments, and it is extremely unlikely that someone would recreate a beach environment indoors. A beach typically consists of sand, a body of water, and open space that stretches out to the horizon. The combination of these elements creates an ideal setting for the dog to freely play and explore. In conclusion, the information given in the premise – a dog playing with a golf ball in front of a small wooden fence on the beach – is enough to validate the hypothesis that the dog is outside. The activities mentioned, the presence of a fence, and the beach environment all collectively point towards an outdoor setting, providing strong evidence that the hypothesis is accurate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g. NERVA) tested for spacecraft applications. can we use nuclear power to propel spaceships? Options: I. no II. yes","output":"Option II: Yes Using nuclear power to propel spaceships is indeed a viable option that has drawn the attention of researchers, space agencies, and governments worldwide. Nuclear propulsion offers several advantages over conventional chemical propulsion, such as high efficiency, increased specific impulse, and the capability to perform long-duration missions. There are a few types of nuclear propulsion technologies for space applications that have been proposed and investigated over the years. Some of them are briefly described below: 1. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): NTP systems utilize the heat generated by a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid (usually liquid hydrogen), which is then expelled through a nozzle to produce thrust. NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application) is one example of an NTP that underwent testing in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. NTP systems have the potential to be at least twice as efficient as chemical propulsion systems. 2. Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP): NEP systems use the electricity generated by a nuclear reactor to power an electric propulsion system, such as ion thrusters or Hall-effect thrusters. The electric propulsion system uses this electricity to accelerate charged particles, generating thrust with an extremely high specific impulse. While the overall thrust may not be as high as NTP systems, NEP systems can operate for much longer periods, making them suitable for deep space missions. 3. Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rockets (BNTR): BNTR systems combine the features of NTP and NEP systems. This design allows the spacecraft to switch between modes depending on the mission's specific requirements. For instance, the NTP mode can be used for high-thrust maneuvers, while the NEP mode is utilized for more efficient, long-duration thrust. 4. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion (NPP): NPP systems rely on nuclear explosions to generate a propulsion force. Project Orion, developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s, is an example of an NPP study. While NPP systems have a high potential for efficiency and thrust, their practical implementation faces significant challenges, including the risks associated with nuclear explosions, material stresses, and potential political ramifications. 5. Fusion Propulsion: Fusion-based propulsion systems have also been proposed, but their development is currently at a nascent stage. Fusion propulsion relies on the energy released during the fusion of atoms to generate thrust. Compared to fission-based nuclear propulsion, fusion promises a much higher energy density, reduced radiation concerns, and an abundant fuel supply. However, the technology is yet to be demonstrated on Earth, let alone in space. In summary, nuclear propulsion technologies provide promising pathways for the development of efficient and long-lasting spacecraft propulsion systems. The main challenge lies in addressing various technical, safety, environmental, and political concerns associated with nuclear power. With continued research into advanced propulsion systems, it is conceivable that nuclear power can play a significant role in the future of human space exploration and interplanetary missions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Somebody really needs to have a word with Secretary of State Pompeo before he meets anybody in North Korea. He just referred to Kim Jong-un as “Chairman Un”. That’s like, I dunno, calling Winston Churchill “Prime Minister Spencer”pic.twitter.com/p0s2DRfuJc ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea released three American prisoners and handed them over to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, clearing a major obstacle to an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      The men, who were freed after Pompeo met Kim, were on their way home aboard the chief U.S. diplomat’s plane, and Trump said he would greet them when they arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Thursday morning.      “We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the three said in a statement released by the State Department as their plane stopped over in Alaska.      “We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God Bless America, the greatest nation in the world.”      The release, praised by the White House as a “gesture of goodwill,” appeared to signal an effort by Kim to set a more favorable tone for the summit and followed his recent pledge to suspend missile tests and shut a nuclear bomb test site.      While Kim is giving up the last of his American detainees, whom North Korea has often used as bargaining chips, their return could also be aimed at pressuring Trump to make concessions as he tries to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal, something it has not signaled a willingness to do.      The release gave Trump a chance to tout a diplomatic achievement just a day after his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal drew heavy criticism from European allies and others.      “I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health,” Trump wrote on Twitter.      “I appreciate Kim Jong Un doing this and allowing them to go,” Trump told reporters at the White House.      Kim’s handover of the Americans was in response to an “official suggestion” from Trump, the North Korean state news agency KCNA said in its account of the talks with Pompeo. It was their second encounter in less than six weeks to prepare the first-ever meeting between sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders.      Trump said agreement had been reached on a date and venue for the summit and details would be announced within three days. He ruled out the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, increasing the possibility the meeting could take place in Singapore, which he previously said was under consideration.      FIRST STEP      Kim said the summit would be an “excellent first step” toward an improved situation on the Korean peninsula, according to KCNA. Though tensions have eased recently, it was just months ago that fears of war were running high in the region.      The family of Tony Kim, one of the freed prisoners, said in a statement: “We are very grateful for the release of our husband and father, Tony Kim, and the other two American detainees.”      The fate of the three Korean-Americans had been among a number of delicate issues in the run-up to summit, which is being planned for late May or early June.      As Pompeo returned to his Pyongyang hotel from a 90-minute meeting with Kim, the secretary of state crossed his fingers when asked by reporters if there was good news about the prisoners.      A North Korean official came to the hotel shortly afterwards to inform Pompeo that Kim had granted them “amnesty,” according to a senior U.S. official present for the exchange.      “You should make care that they do not make the same mistakes again,” the North Korean official was quoted as saying. “This was a hard decision.”The three, who walked without assistance to Pompeo’s plane and were seated near medical personnel, were in the air less than an hour after leaving custody.      North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in this undated photo released on May 9, 2018 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang. KCNA/via REUTERS      “They were happy to be with us on this plane, to be sure,” Pompeo told reporters during the flight.      They are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong-chul, detained in 2015; Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak-song, who also taught at PUST and was detained last year.      North Korean state media says they were arrested either for subversion or “hostile acts” against the government.      ‘VERY PRODUCTIVE’      Speaking to reporters, Pompeo said his meetings in Pyongyang were “very productive.” The two sides agreed to meet again to finalize details of the summit, a U.S. official said.      KCNA said Kim and Pompeo reached a “satisfactory consensus” on the issues they discussed, but provided no specifics.      U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while there was “reason for some optimism” about the summit, the U.S. troop presence in South Korea would not be part of initial negotiations.      There was also no sign that Pompeo’s visit had cleared up the question of whether North Korea would be willing to bargain away nuclear missiles that might threaten the United States.      Trump has credited his “maximum pressure” campaign for drawing North Korea to the table and has vowed to keep sanctions in place until Pyongyang takes concrete steps to denuclearize.      But former spy chief Kim Yong Chul, director of North Korea’s United Front Department, said in a toast to Pompeo over lunch in Pyongyang: “We have perfected our nuclear capability. It is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress ... This is not the result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside.”      Slideshow (7 Images)      Daniel Russel, until recently the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, said the prisoner release would reduce tensions, but was not a sign that peace was at hand.      “We should hold off on awarding ourselves Nobel prizes. North Korea is stating clearly that what is on the table is merely tension reduction and possible ultimate global arms reduction. It is not talking about eliminating its own nuclear program.”      Korea: a land divided - tmsnrt.rs/2KdXMcS ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"North Korea has released three American prisoners, a significant move ahead of the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

In order to better understand the reasons for this assertion, let's analyze the review in greater detail. Firstly, the reviewer's use of emphatic, enthusiastic language immediately conveys their strong positive feelings towards the CD/DVD in question. Phrases such as \\"awesome CD/DVD,\\" \\"words can't describe,\\" and \\"must\\" indicate that the reviewer is not only pleased with the product but also highly recommends it to others. Additionally, the reviewer's mention that they have seen the band in concert \\"a few times\\" suggests that they are knowledgeable about the subject matter and have a basis of comparison for evaluating the CD/DVD. Their positive experience in live shows adds weight to their overall opinion of the product, and when they state that they feel like they're at a concert while listening to the CD/DVD, it implies that the product is successful in capturing the essence and atmosphere of the live performances. Furthermore, the reviewer appeals to the fan base of the band by asserting that the CD/DVD is a \\"must\\" for any Linkin Park fan. By doing so, they create a sense of urgency and importance for those who enjoy the band's work. This not only emphasizes the reviewer's satisfaction with the product but also encourages the band's fan base to acquire it. Interestingly, the reviewer goes beyond addressing just the fans by stating that \\"even if you're not [a Linkin Park fan], it's still a great CD/DVD.\\" This statement suggests that the product holds merit even for those who may not be familiar or particularly fond of the band. By widening the potential audience in this manner, the reviewer portrays the product as being universally appealing and enjoyable. In conclusion, the review paints the product in a flattering light, as evidenced by the excited language, appeals to both fans and non-fans alike, the reviewer's personal experience with the live performances, and their strong recommendation of the product. This positive portrayal would likely contribute to persuading potential customers to consider purchasing the CD/DVD."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Solve this problem.","output":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this problem step-by-step like solving a puzzle: Problem: 49*l - 20 = 16*l + 13 First, we want to get all the \\"l\\" pieces (the numbers with \\"l\\") on one side of the equal sign and the other numbers on the other side. 1. We will take the 16*l from the right side and move it to the left. But, when we move it, we have to change its sign. Since it's positive (+) on the right, it will become negative (-) on the left. So, now our problem looks like this: 49*l - 16*l - 20 = 13 2. Next, let's combine the \\"l\\" pieces on the left side by subtracting 16*l from 49*l. Here's a little secret: when numbers have \\"l\\" attached to them (like 49*l and 16*l), you can combine them by just combining the numbers (49 and 16) and putting \\"l\\" back with the new number. 49*l - 16*l = 33*l Now our problem looks like this: 33*l - 20 = 13 3. Let's move the -20 from the left side to the right side. Remember the rule: when we move a number, we have to change its sign. So, the -20 will become a +20 when it goes to the right side. Now we have: 33*l = 13 + 20 4. Now, we just need to solve for \\"l.\\" We can start by adding the numbers on the right side. 13 + 20 = 33 So, our problem now looks like: 33*l = 33 5. To find \\"l,\\" we will now do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing! We need to divide both sides of the equal sign by 33 to get \\"l\\" by itself. 33*l / 33 = 33 / 33 This simplifies to: l = 1 And there you have it, little buddy!

Black Sabbath were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history. The remaining two original members, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. Samson's Nicky Moore, and Lone Star's John Sloman were considered and Iommi states in his autobiography that Michael Bolton auditioned for the band. The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982. While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums. Born Again (7 August 1983) was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the U.S. Even a decade after its release AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album \\"dreadful\\", noting that \\"Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom\\".  Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. \\"I fell apart with the idea of touring\\", Ward later said. \\"I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake.\\" Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 - '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the U.S. with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song \\"Smoke on the Water\\" to their set list.  The tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained:  We had Sharon Osbourne's dad, Don Arden, managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in metres but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen metres instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area. It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were there any hit tracks on Born Again?","output":"There isn't any direct quote mentioning hit tracks on Born Again in the given text.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who were the humanist anti-humanists?\\" is in \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\".

Answer choices: - less water  - dry  - heat  - clouds  - drought  - moisture  - salinity  - heat energy A:","output":"Evaporation lowers moisture, which ultimately results in less water in the area where evaporation occurs. This can cause a number of related effects, such as making the environment drier, contributing to heat (since heat energy is transferred away during evaporation), and potentially leading to the formation of clouds when the evaporated water vapor condenses in the atmosphere. In some cases, increased evaporation can even contribute to drought conditions if it significantly reduces the amount of available water in an area. Moreover, evaporation can lead to an increase in salinity in bodies of water, as the salts and other dissolved substances are left behind when the water evaporates.

Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides.  Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly.  Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","output":"In order to determine which person's Geiger counter has less current running through it, it's important to understand the working principle of a Geiger counter and the relation between the counts per minute (CPM) and the current produced. A Geiger counter is a handheld device used for radiation detection and measurement. It consists of a Geiger-Müller (GM) tube, which is a gas-filled tube that indicates the presence of ionizing radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma particles. When ionizing radiation enters the GM tube, it ionizes the gas inside, creating charged particles. These charged particles then create an electrical discharge or pulse, which is amplified and can be heard as clicks or beeps. The rate at which the Geiger counter clicks, or the counts per minute (CPM), indicates the level of radiation present in the area. A higher CPM implies a higher level of radiation, and therefore, a higher amount of ionizing particles detected by the GM tube. Now, let's consider the situation with Robert and Thomas: Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly near the Ferris wheel, which indicates a lower CPM and suggests that there is less radiation in that area. This results in fewer gas ionizations and electrical pulses inside the GM tube over time. In contrast, Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly near the merry-go-round, which signifies a higher CPM and suggests that there is higher radiation in that area. Consequently, there will be more ionizations and electrical pulses occurring in the GM tube over time. Since the current produced is directly proportional to the number of ionizations and electrical pulses, we can deduce the following: - A higher CPM correlates to more ionizations and electrical pulses, which results in a higher current running through the Geiger counter. - A lower CPM correlates to fewer ionizations and electrical pulses, which results in a lower current running through the Geiger counter. Based on the information provided, Robert's Geiger counter at the Ferris wheel is clicking slowly, indicating a lower CPM and hence, less current running through it. Thomas's Geiger counter, however, is clicking rapidly near the merry-go-round, signifying a higher CPM and more current running through his device.  So, to answer the question, Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it compared to Thomas's Geiger counter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no. He liked telling them no, especially when it was the truth. Does the clinic Ray works at receive government funding? - not enough information - Yes - Only insurance payments - Clients never pay A:","output":"There isn't enough information provided in the passage to precisely determine whether the clinic Ray works at receives government funding. The primary focus of the passage is on the challenges that clinics face when treating uninsured and uninsurable patients, who often do not pay for the services they receive, leaving the clinic with financial difficulties. While it is clear that the clinic deals with payment issues, primarily receiving income from insurance payments and the small percentage of clients who pay, it doesn't explicitly state if any government funding is provided to the clinic. It is possible that the clinic could be receiving some form of government financial assistance, but based on the information given, this cannot be confirmed. The passage portrays a system where the hospital and the clinic are interconnected in managing these challenging patients, but both struggle to find financial stability because of patients not paying or maintaining their treatments. Ray's frustrations stem from the limited resources available to deal with this difficult reality and from the hospital's willingness to transfer the burden to the clinic. As a result, he doesn't feel enthusiasm for helping uninsured and uninsurable clients, especially when he knows how the situation tends to pan out. In conclusion, the passage does not provide sufficient information to confirm whether the clinic Ray works at receives government funding or not. However, it is evident that the clinic faces significant financial challenges due to the number of uninsured patients who do not pay for their treatments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option A: 125  Option B: 225  Option C: 325  Option D: 425  Option E: None of these Output:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Arya has traveled and use that to determine the side length of the square. Once we have the side length, we can compute the area. Arya is traveling at 20 km/hr, and she takes 90 minutes to travel from point A to point C. First, let's convert the time into hours: 90 minutes = 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

In a square, the diagonal can be expressed in terms of its side length (s) using the Pythagorean theorem: Diagonal² = Side² + Side² Diagonal² = 2 × Side² Since the diagonal length is 30 km: 30² = 2 × Side² 900 = 2 × Side² Side² = 450 Side = √450 ≈ 21.21 km Now that we have the side length, we can find the area of the square: Area = Side × Side Area = 21.21 × 21.21 Area ≈ 450 (approximately) None of the given options matches the approximated answer.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out.

In leaving, they also shoot the little dog of fourteen-year-old Megan Wheeler. As Megan buries her dog in the woods and prays for a miracle, a stranger passes by heading to the town on horseback. Megan's mother, Sarah, is being courted by Hull Barret, the leader of the miners. Hull heads to town to pick up supplies, where some of the same thugs begin to beat him up and he is rescued by the stranger, who takes the three men on single-handedly. Hull invites him to dinner at his house, and while the stranger is washing, Hull notices what looks like six bullet wounds to his back.

Coy LaHood has been away in Sacramento and is furious to learn about Preacherâs arrival through his son, since this will stiffen the resistance of the tin-panners.

Write the answer: \\"Who wrote \\"\\"I Write the Songs\\"\\", a 1976 chart-topping song by Barry Manilow?\\"","output":"\\"I Write the Songs\\" is a popular song from 1976, most famously performed and popularized by Barry Manilow. However, it is a common misconception that Barry Manilow wrote the song himself. The song was actually written by Bruce Johnston, an accomplished musician, singer, and songwriter, who is best known for his work as a member of the iconic American rock band, The Beach Boys. Born on June 27, 1942, in Peoria, Illinois, as Benjamin Baldwin, Bruce Johnston's family moved to Beverly Hills, California when he was a child. It was here that he became interested in music and started his career in the entertainment industry early on. Johnston first made a name for himself as a successful session musician and background vocalist. He joined The Beach Boys in 1965, providing vocals, bass, and key instruments on some of their defining albums, such as \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"The Smile Sessions.\\" Johnston's songwriting skills came to the forefront when he wrote \\"I Write the Songs.\\" The song was first recorded by The Captain & Tennille, an American pop music duo, for their album \\"Love Will Keep Us Together.\\" It was later released by David Cassidy in 1975, but neither of these versions managed to make a significant impact on the charts. Barry Manilow, a popular American singer-songwriter and producer, decided to record \\"I Write the Songs\\" for his album \\"Tryin' to Get the Feeling.\\" Released in 1975, the song became a chart-topping hit in 1976, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on January 17, 1976, and holding that position for a week. With Manilow's mesmerizing vocals and exceptional arrangement, the song became an instant fan favorite, earning a Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1977. So, while Barry Manilow is the artist most commonly associated with \\"I Write the Songs\\" due to the song's significant success, it was Bruce Johnston, The Beach Boys band member, who actually wrote and composed the iconic hit. This is a testament to Johnston's prowess as a songwriter, as well as Manilow's immense talent in arranging and performing the song in a way that brought it to the forefront of popular music during that era."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Moloch was either practised ( as a sacrifice ) or worshipped ( as a god ) by the Canaanites , Phoenicians , and related cultures in North Africa and the Levant . As a god worshiped by the Phoenicians and Canaanites , Moloch had associations with a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice by parents . Moloch figures in the Book of Deuteronomy and in the Book of Leviticus as a forbidden form of idolatry ( Leviticus 18:21 : \`\` And thou shalt not let any of thy seeds ( children ) pass through the fire to Moloch '' ) . In the Old Testament , Gehenna was a valley by Jerusalem , where followers of various Baalim and Canaanite gods , including Moloch , sacrificed their children by fire ( 2 Chr . 28:3 , 33:6 ; Jer . 7:31 , 19:2 -- 6 ) . Moloch has been used figuratively in English literature from John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) to Allen Ginsberg 's \`\` Howl '' ( 1955 ) , to refer to a person or thing demanding or requiring a very costly sacrifice .  - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.  - Biologically, a child (plural: children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. The legal definition of \\"child\\" generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority.  - Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more human beings, usually as an offering to a deity, as part of a ritual. Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history. Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods, spirits or the deceased, for example as a propitiatory offering or as a retainer sacrifice when a king's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting.  - Child sacrifice is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please, propitiate or force a god or supernatural beings in order to achieve a desired result. As such, it is a form of human sacrifice. The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion. Child sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is.  - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.

Q:-  A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process might be: The ecosystem experiences a period of recovery and regeneration as the forest gradually regrows, and the surviving animals and plants repopulate the area, restoring the balance of the ecosystem over time. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. After the fire is extinguished or burns out, the burnt forest is left with little to no vegetation, which means there is limited food and shelter available for the surviving animals. 2. While the plants that provide food are gone initially, some plant species might have fire-resistant seeds or root structures that enable them to grow again after the fire. 3. As the plants and vegetation begin to regrow, the ecosystem will gradually start to recover. This process may take months, years, or even decades, depending on the severity of the fire and the specific ecosystem. 4. As the plants and trees return, so do the insects, birds, and other animals that rely on them for food and shelter. This process may be slow as the surviving animals need to repopulate the area and new generations need to be born in the recovering ecosystem. 5. Eventually, the ecosystem will reach a new state of balance, where the populations of animals and plants are stable and have adapted to the post-fire conditions and regrowth.

They are both asking about the challenges or questions in chemical engineering that haven't been solved or answered yet. Since you're curious, let me explain a few unsolved problems in chemical engineering in a simple way: 1. Energy storage: It's like having a big toy box that can hold lots of energy from the sun or wind for later use. Scientists are trying to figure out how to make it better and store more energy without taking up a lot of space. 2. Plastic waste: You know how we have lots of plastic toys, bottles, and bags? Well, they don't go away easily and can hurt the environment. Chemical engineers are searching for ways to recycle them or make new products that won't harm our planet. 3. Clean water: Some people don't have clean water to drink or use. Chemical engineers want to find ways to make dirty water clean using special processes, so everyone can have safe water. 4.

Q:Information:  - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas.  - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.   - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office .  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States.  - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State.  - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties. The largest city in the region is Kennett.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'politician'.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: The story does not say how much this new procedure costs or compare it with existing treatments for patients who don’t respond to medication. Deep brain stimulation, the current treatment standard, can run anywhere from 30,000 to 70,000, according to various online cost estimates. There also may be additional costs incurred by those patients who have adverse effects. The story is long on description but short on numbers. Saying the treatment “has had an immense impact on patients’ lives,” the story devotes quite a bit of print along with video footage to show rapid functional and quality-of-life improvements experienced by patients, focusing on one women who said her tremor “has almost disappeared” since she had the procedure in June. Video showing this patient before and after treatment–including her attempts to write her name, trace a spiral and pour water from one cup to another–do a great job of conveying the improvements. This is terrific news for this woman, but we’re not told how representative her experience is of overall outcomes. Is she a best-case scenario? Middle of the road? There are also inspiring quotes from a researcher, including a description of the “remarkable moment” patients experience when they realized the tremor has subsided. “They can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public. So it really is extraordinarily helpful for people,” he says. In terms of study data, the story says researchers “found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly” in patients who underwent the treatment as well as reported improvements in quality of life. But there are no figures. In fact, according to the study, patients experienced a 47 percent improvement in tremor scores, dropping from 18.1 points on a 32-point scale at baseline to 9.6 points three months after the procedure. That data should have been included. Also, the story should have spelled out that 56 patients received the treatment, versus 20 who experienced a fake procedure. Also worth pointing out: We don’t know the meaning or clinical significance of a reduction of this magnitude in the total score. The story addresses adverse effects, and that’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. We do wish the story had quantified the harms that were measured in the study. The fourth paragraph says the procedure “brings lasting side effects in some patients” and later the story quotes a physician who is not involved in the research as saying, “It’s a pretty high incidence of side effects.” But nowhere do exact numbers appear. Rather than citing data from the study, the story quotes the physician as saying that “over a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia,” or numbness. This information isn’t very useful because the story does not explain when these rates were measured. According to the study, three months after the procedure 36% of patients had gait disturbance and 38% had numbness. After 12 months, the numbers dropped, to 9 percent and 14 percent respectively. Also worth mentioning is that one patient was reported to have permanent diminished sensation of the dominant thumb and index figure, which was categorized as a serious adverse event. That did not appear in the story. The story clearly spells out that there isn’t data on the long-term efficacy of this procedure, and that more study is needed, so we’ll give this a barely passing Satisfactory. Several important study limitations were not included in the story, such as the fact that the treatment did not provide significant improvement for some types of tremors, and the treatment is not appropriate for people who are unwilling or unable to undergo an MRI. We’re also not told that the sham group was only followed for 3 months, while the experimental group was followed for a year. This is not usually recommended in clinical trials and both groups should be followed for the same length of time. The story cites a figure from the International Essential Tremor Foundation, an advocacy group, that an estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition. However, a 2014 analysis of existing research put the number of cases at around 7 million as of 2012, or about 2.2% of the U.S. population. While this may not qualify as disease mongering, the story could have pointed out that the exact number of cases isn’t clear. Also, the story should have noted that not all people with essential tremor have symptoms severe enough to require treatment. The story only fulfills part of our criteria. It does use one independent source, a physician who was not involved in the study. It also accurately reports the trial’s funding sources: InSightec, which developed the device; along with Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which is funded by device makers and philanthropic organizations; and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation, an Israel-U.S. government partnership that receives corporate support. However, the story falls short because it does not report the fact that nine of the study authors reported conflicts of interest, with most receiving financial compensation of some sort from device makers in the field. Lead researcher G. Rees Cosgrove, M.D. who is quoted in the story, reported receiving consulting fees from InSightec. The story states, “Doctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don’t work well for all patients.” That’s true, and so we’ll give this a Satisfactory rating for at least mentioning alternatives. But it should be noted that other procedural treatment options were not compared or even mentioned in the story and received only a brief mention in one of the videos. The current standard for tremor patients who don’t respond to medication is deep-brain stimulation, in which a probe connected to a pacemaker is implanted in the thalamus to suppress the tremors. Gamma Knife thalamotomy, which delivers precise doses of radiation to the thalamus, is also considered to be a safe and effective therapy for patients who don’t respond to medication. Also, some patients have mild symptoms that can be treated with relaxation techniques and the avoidance of triggers such as caffeine. The story states that the device was approved by the FDA in July. The story could have done readers a service by giving a sense of how many medical centers around the country are geared up to perform the procedure, or will be soon. This is indeed a new treatment option for essential tremor, though the story may leave readers with the false impression that the concept of killing off neurons in the thalamus is new. Rather, it’s the use of focused ultrasound to destroy brain tissue, rather than a probe inserted in the brain, that constitutes an advance. The story does not appear to rely solely on the news release, which we also reviewed. Claim: New treatment offers some hope for an unshakable tremor Student:","output":"The paragraph supports the claim that a new treatment offers hope for an unshakable tremor by providing various pieces of evidence. It mentions the significant reduction in the severity of essential tremor and improvements in the quality of life experienced by patients who underwent the treatment.

Furthermore, it includes a researcher's quotes describing the \\"remarkable moment\\" patients realize their tremor has subsided, and how they can regain control over their daily activities. However, the paragraph also points out that there are limitations and missing data in the story. The exact magnitude and clinical significance of the reported reduction in total tremor score are not thoroughly explained. Moreover, there is no information about how representative the presented patient's experience is of the overall outcomes, nor are the adverse effects precisely quantified.

Therefore, I would opt for option (B) - Use a calculator to scale it to the correct size. Step 2: Identify the required dimensions. Determine the desired size for the lamp, which may depend on factors such as available space, purpose of the lamp, and design preferences. Step 3: Measure the current dimensions of the lamp. Using a measuring tape or ruler, measure the lamp's dimensions, such as height, width, and depth. Note down these measurements. Step 4: Calculate the scale factor. Determine the scale factor needed to achieve the desired dimensions. To do this, divide the desired dimension by the current dimension. For example, if the current height is 10 inches, and the desired height is 15 inches, the scale factor would be 1.5 (15/10 = 1.5). Step 5: Apply the scale factor to other dimensions. Multiply the scale factor with the other dimensions (width and depth) to get the new dimensions for the lamp. For example, if the current width is 5 inches, the new width would be 7.5 inches (5 inches x 1.5 = 7.5 inches). Step 6: Verify the new dimensions. Double-check the new dimensions to ensure they meet the initial requirements. If not, adjust the scale factor and repeat the calculations.

All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.

The process this year took longer than the investigation last year, because the  OPTIONS:  1). process was less involved.;  2). investigation was less involved.;","output":"The process this year took longer than the investigation last year, because the investigation was less involved. There are several factors that contributed to this difference in duration and complexity. First, the scope of the investigation last year was narrower, which allowed the team to focus more on specific issues and work more efficiently overall. With a smaller range of topics to cover, the investigators were able to dedicate more time to each individual issue and reach conclusions sooner. Secondly, the team that conducted the investigation last year had more experience working together, resulting in better communication, smoother collaboration, and overall faster progress. The team this year, on the other hand, included several new members who needed time to familiarize themselves with the procedures and working dynamics, eventually slowing down the process. The investigation last year also had fewer stakeholders involved. This simplified the decision-making process, since there were less opinions to consider and address. In contrast, this year's process had multiple stakeholders with differing interests, which led to more deliberation and the need to reach a consensus, thus extending the duration of the investigation. Another contributing factor to the longer process this year was the amount of evidence that needed to be reviewed and analyzed. Compared to last year's investigation, there was significantly more documentation, testimonies, and data to process this year, requiring an extensive amount of time to ensure a thorough analysis. Lastly, this year's complexity may have also been heightened by additional regulatory and compliance requirements that were not present last year. These new regulations required the investigators to take additional steps to ensure that they met the necessary legal standards, adding time and effort to the process. In summary, the reason this year's process took longer than the investigation last year is primarily due to the latter being less involved. The narrower scope, more experienced team, fewer stakeholders, less evidence to analyze, and lack of additional regulatory requirements all contributed to the quicker completion of last year's investigation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 42-year-old is so worried that he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand artificial intelligence, or","output":"AI, has indeed made significant strides in development over the past few years, leading to remarkable innovations in various fields, including self-driving cars, healthcare, and the automation of several jobs. However, Musk's concerns about the potential risks that the rapid advancements in AI technology might pose to humanity should not be taken lightly. The Tesla-founder's statement echoes the sentiments expressed by several scientists and tech experts, who have previously called for the responsible development and governance of AI to prevent negative outcomes. As per Musk, a 'Terminator-like' scenario could become a reality if research into artificial intelligence is left unchecked and without any regulations. This could lead to the rise of autonomous machines, which operate without human intervention, potentially causing widespread unemployment or even conflicts between humans and intelligent machines. To prevent such a dystopian future, Musk has taken it upon himself to invest in AI companies, with the primary objective of monitoring the technology's progress and ensuring that it remains beneficial and well-controlled. Rather than seeking monetary gains, Musk wants to maintain a close watch on AI research to prevent any unintended and catastrophic consequences. One way for Musk and the broader scientific community to address AI safety concerns is by promoting transparency and collaboration among researchers, developers, and regulators. This includes the establishment of a global set of guidelines and ethical standards to which all AI researchers and developers should adhere, as well as incentives for complying with such principles. Furthermore, tech giants and research institutions should continue funding AI safety research. By understanding the potential risks of AI technology, researchers can develop ways to mitigate them and create a more secure foundation for the field's future innovations. In addition to these preventive measures, various stakeholders – including governments, policymakers, and tech companies – need to come together to voice their concerns and actively participate in discussions on AI regulation, oversight, and safety policies. By fostering international cooperation, a global consensus can be reached on striking the right balance between AI innovation and ensuring the responsible management of this transformative technology. In conclusion, while Elon Musk's concerns about a potential 'Terminator-like' scenario emerging from AI research are valid, there are ways to address these risks through collaboration, transparency, and responsible governance of AI technology. By investing in AI companies, with a focus on fostering AI safety, Musk is taking proactive measures to prevent the uncontrollable rise of artificial intelligence. It is now upon the global community of stakeholders, including researchers, regulators, and policymakers, to come together to ensure a safer and more reliable future powered by AI."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.  Paragraph: John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state.

One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The old adage that 'time is like a river', suggesting that we move through it like a ship sailing on water, may be wrong. A new theory claims that time does not move forward, but rather, everything in time is ever-present. According to the theory, if we were to ‘look down’ upon the universe, we would see time spread out in all directions, just as we see space at the moment. Scroll down for video. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of philosophy has presented a new theory of time. Dr Bradford Skow says the idea that time flows like a river (stock image shown) is not necessarily correct. Instead he claims space-time is a 'block universe' where the past, present and future all exist together. The intriguing theory was put forward by Dr Bradford Skow, an associated professor of philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In his new book, Objective Becoming, he examines some of the theories that have been postulated to explain time. ‘When you ask people, “Tell me about the passage of time,” they usually make a metaphor,’ he said. In 1927 British astronomer Arthur Eddington first devised the ‘one-way direction’ or ‘asymmetry ‘ of time. He said that by studying the organisation of matter, it was possible to make a 4D map of the universe. The so-called ‘arrow of time’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘random’ future, toward which everything is moving. This is also known as entropy, which tends to increase with time. Entropy, a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse. This means that entropy will always increase in the universe. Some say this may lead to a ‘heat death’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in Isaac Asimov’s short story The Last Question. However, owing to the law of gravity, some think such a future is not a possibility. And Dr Skow thinks the 'arrow of time' theory itself is not necessarily correct. ‘They say time flows like a river, or we move through time like a ship sailing through the sea.’ Another theory states that the present is a ‘spotlight’ that moves from the past to the future, with us being located in the spotlight as it moves forward. Dr Skow, however, said he ‘wouldn’t want to believe in that unless I saw good arguments for it.’ Rather, he favours a theory known as the ‘block universe’, which states that the past, present and future already exist. Dr Skow said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of space-time. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' Dr Skow said. ‘We’re not located at a single time.’ Instead he says we are in a 'temporarily scattered' condition. He asserts that our passage through space-time is not like a spotlight - and the experiences you had yesterday, last week, or even years ago are all real. But he says time travel between the different times is not possible, as we are now in a different part of space-time. Dr Skow (pictured) said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of spacetime. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' he said. ‘We’re not located at a single time’ If we were to look down upon the universe, we would see time spread out, said Dr Skow. But he adds the present is not a 'spotlight' in time - but rather we are in a 'temporally scattered' condition. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang, a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time. The radical theory was proposed by Dr Julian Barbour of College Farm in the UK, Dr Tim Koslowski of the University of New Brunswick in Canada and Dr Flavio Mercati of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, also in Canada. Their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘arrow of time’ - which is the concept that time is ‘symmetric’ and everything moves forwards. They say that at the time of the Big Bang not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time, but opposite to each other. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang (illustrated), a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards. This universe would not be exactly the same as ours, though; it would have evolved and changed in its own way, completely separate to our own. However, it would be subject to the same laws of physics, so it would likely have planets, stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos. And Dr Barbour told MailOnline the theory could open up a new way to think about the Big Bang. ‘At the moment when people talk about the Big Bang, they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they can’t say what happened,' he said. ‘Now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought.’ Which theory of time proves to be correct, though - Dr Skow's block universe, the mirror universe or perhaps another - remains to be seen.

His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practising Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass guitarist Larry Graham and the late songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles. Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (nee Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.  On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single \\"Over\\", peaking at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, \\"Find Your Love\\", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, \\"care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image].\\" The third single and fourth singles, \\"Miss Me\\" and \\"Fancy\\" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.  Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.  It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois.

Be it from the wood of a picnic table or the thorns of a rosebush, the annoyance of a splinter should never be underestimated. Successfully removing a splinter is essential to avoid infection and alleviate discomfort. This article examines six proven methods to safely and gently remove splinters at home. 1. Examine the Splinter The first step in removing a splinter is to examine it closely. Locate the splinter with proper lighting and determine the angle at which it entered the skin. Positioning your hand close and personal with the affected area allows you greater control and precision in the removal process. Take note of the size and depth of the splinter to decide on the best technique for removal. For larger splinters or those embedded deep in the skin, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare professional. 2. Using Tape to Gently Pull the Splinter Out For smaller, shallower splinters, using a piece of tape can help gently pull the splinter out of the skin. Clear adhesive tape is preferable for easy visualization of the splinter. Gently press the tape onto the affected area, ensuring that the sticky side makes contact with the protruding end of the splinter. Slowly peel away the tape, watching as the splinter comes out with it. Following this, clean the area with soap and water to prevent infection. 3. Trying Glue to Get the Splinter Out If the tape doesn't work, using a small amount of glue is another option. Apply a thin layer of white school glue or wood glue to the area, making sure to cover the entire splinter. Allow the glue to dry completely. Then, gently peel the glue off the skin, and the splinter should come along with it. Keep in mind that this method is not recommended for deep splinters or those in sensitive areas. 4. Applying Baking Soda to Get the Splinter Out Baking soda paste is an effective home remedy that can be used with small, stubborn splinters. Combine baking soda with water until it forms a thick paste. Apply the paste to the affected area and cover it with a bandage or cloth. Leave it to rest for approximately 24 hours before removing the bandage. This process allows the baking soda to soften the skin and force the splinter to the surface, making it easier to remove with tweezers or your fingers. As always, clean the area after removal. 5. Using Ichthammol Ointment to Remove the Splinter Ichthammol ointment, also known as black drawing salve, is a traditional remedy for extracting splinters and other foreign objects from the skin. Apply a small amount of the ointment to the splintered area and cover it with a band-aid or gauze. Let it sit for several hours, and then remove the bandage. The splinter should have worked its way to the surface or become easier to remove. Use alcohol to sanitize the area afterwards. 6. Applying Epsom Salts to the Splinter Epsom salts are a versatile remedy, particularly effective in drawing out splinters embedded in the skin. Mix a small amount of Epsom salts with water to create a paste. Apply the paste directly to the splinter area and cover it with a bandage. Leave it on for a few hours and then check to see if the splinter has risen to the surface. Once visible, use clean tweezers to remove the splinter and follow up with proper wound cleaning techniques. Conclusion Splinters can be unpleasant, but with these six methods in your at-home toolkit, you will be well-prepared to safely and effectively extract them. Pay attention to how your body reacts to each technique and choose the one that suits you best. Remember, if a splinter seems too deep or causes excessive pain, consult a healthcare professional. It is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Question: In what years did television series that inspired the spin-off film \\"The Frighteners\\" air? Passage:Peter Jackson and partner/co-writer Fran Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners in 1992, during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal green-lighted the film to commence pre-production on a 26 million budget in April 1994. The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.

By JACK MATHEWS DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday, March 29th 2002, 1:71AM NO SUCH THING. With Robert John Burke, Sarah Polley, Helen Mirren, Julie Christie. Written and directed by Hal Hartley. Running time: 101 mins. At the Angelika. Rated R: Language and brief violence. 1 1/2 stars Long Island auteur Hal Hartley, whose quirky films play to an acquired taste I have yet to acquire, turns his ironic eye on the romantic horror genre with \\"No Such Thing,\\" a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" knockoff that blends in some broad satirical notes about global dyspepsia and media madness. Sarah Polley, the 23-year-old Canadian actress whose work in such art-house hits as \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" and \\"The Claim\\" has made her the Queen of the Unseen, plays Beatrice, a New York TV gofer who talks her cynical network news boss (Helen Mirren) into letting her investigate the apparent murders of a film crew by a monster dwelling on the coast of Iceland. En route, Beatrice, whose name alternately means \\"voyager,\\" \\"blessed\\" and \\"bringer of joy,\\" becomes the sole survivor of a plane crash. It's a miraculous event that envelops her in an aura of invincibility just in time for her meeting with the immortal monster (Robert John Burke), a creature with the body of a man, the face of a horned toad and the fiery bellow of a dragon. In less time than one would imagine, Beatrice charms the ill-tempered, alcoholic and curiously articulate creature, learns of his earnest desire to end his life as a figment of man's imagination and brings him back to New York, where she becomes the darling of the media world and he a poor man's King Kong. The monster, tamed by his promise of nonviolence to Beatrice, is prodded by scientists, beaten by mobs and subjected to humiliating mistreatment by punks, while she enjoys the fruits of her sudden fame. No wonder the monster cops such an attitude about mankind. Ultimately, Beatrice's conscience will be stirred back to life, and Iceland (which had a hand in the film's financing) will be revisited. Hartley says he was going for a kind of modern \\"Mothra\\" thing with his monster, and the creature is pretty cool-looking. But its effects are even cheesier than in Japanese horror movies. The film's pace is just plain wacky, moving with the haste of a receding glacier most of the time, but then jumping ahead as if Hartley hit the gas on a time machine. The saving grace, if it amounts to that, is the humor built into the monster, and Burke's deadpan playing of it. Elsewhere, one can only wonder how Mirren, the gemstone of \\"Gosford Park,\\" and Julie Christie, in the tossed-off role of Beatrice's nurse, came to this. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article is a review of the film \\"No Such Thing,\\" directed by Hal Hartley, a romantic horror movie inspired by \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" It stars Sarah Polley as Beatrice, a TV gofer who investigates the murder of a film crew in Iceland only to find a creature (played by Robert John Burke) with a desire to end its existence. The film, according to the critic, has a wacky pace and cheesy effects but is somewhat redeemed by Burke's deadpan performance as the monster. The critic also questions the involvement of Helen Mirren and Julie Christie, considering their talent and previous acclaimed roles. The film is rated 1 1/2 stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Phillipe wanted to use a perfume but the nozzle was blocked because of dirt. Luckily he could clean the   A. dirt out of it.. B. nozzle out of it..","output":"A. Dirt out of it. Phillipe had always taken great care of his possessions, and it was to his great dismay that he discovered the nozzle of his favorite perfume bottle was blocked. He had received the perfume, which contained a subtle and intricate blend of sandalwood, citrus, and earthy undertones, as a gift from his long-lost friend Terry, who was nothing short of a connoisseur in the field of fragrances. The perfume had become Phillipe’s signature scent, garnering him compliments whenever he wore it. Now faced with the task of cleaning the stubborn dirt obstructing the nozzle, Phillipe gathered his materials. He compiled a small box of tools, including cotton swabs, rubbing alcohol, and a magnifying glass. He set up his workspace on an immaculate white tablecloth in his moonlit kitchen, ready to repair his precious perfume bottle. He spent the first few moments examining the blockage closely, using the magnifying glass to get a better look at the minuscule particles of dirt that caused the problem. He quickly discovered that the dirt had formed a thick crust, adhering to the walls of the nozzle with a remarkable tenacity, thus preventing it from performing its intended function. Phillipe knew that he had to tread lightly, as too much pressure could potentially damage the delicate nozzle or the mechanisms within the perfume bottle, leaving them both beyond repair. So, he decided to use a gentle, strategic approach, instead. With great attention to detail, he devised a plan that began with softening the blockage by soaking a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and diligently dabbing it on the dirt. This would not only loosen the crust but also sterilize the nozzle, ensuring no additional contamination to the perfume itself. As he worked to remove the dirt, Phillipe couldn't help but reminisce about the times he and Terry spent together, traveling the world and sampling exotic fragrances on their quests. It was those shared experiences that had solidified their bond and engrained a deep appreciation for fine scents into Phillipe's soul. With the dirt beginning to dissolve, Phillipe felt a sense of satisfaction and hope that soon, he could use his favorite perfume once again. He grabbed a fresh cotton swab and swirled it inside the nozzle, gently dislodging the softened dirt and watching the particles detach and fall away. He repeated this process until the pathway was clear and free from obstruction. Phillipe held his breath as he tested the perfume bottle, pressing the nozzle and releasing a perfect, fine mist of the unforgettable scent. The relief washed over him, knowing that he had restored his perfume bottle to its former glory, evoking memories of past journeys shared with Terry. Adorning himself in the revitalized fragrance, Phillipe couldn't help but feel a renewed connection to his dear friend and the memories of their adventures. Grateful for the chance to clean the dirt out of his perfume nozzle, and even more so for the stories it held, Phillipe vowed to continue upholding the legacies of their friendship and shared appreciation for the art of perfume. And as the scent enveloped him, Phillipe knew that Terry would be proud."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Is \\"Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When was the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts published?\\"","output":"No, the provided statement does not directly answer the question \\"When was the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts published?\\" Instead, it discusses the broad influence of strict liability for defective products, which originated from judicial interpretations of warranty laws. To adequately address the question, you should provide information about the publication and adoption of Section 402A. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: The Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts was published in 1965 by the American Law Institute (ALI). This particular section presented a significant shift in product liability law by introducing the principle of strict liability for defective products. Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. (59 Cal. 2d 57; 1963), a landmark California Supreme Court case decided prior to publication of the rule, is often cited as the catalyst for this legal development. In the Greenman case, the plaintiff was injured while using a power tool that had been manufactured by Yuba Power Products. He filed a complaint on the grounds that the tool was defective and unreasonably dangerous, causing his injury. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the manufacturer should be held strictly liable for any injuries resulting from their defective product, regardless of any negligence or contractual relationships. Chief Justice Traynor, who authored the majority opinion, set the foundation for Section 402A by emphasizing the importance of placing the burden of product defects on the manufacturer. This concept, the \\"Greenman rule,\\" recognizes that the manufacturer is better equipped to bear the costs and risks associated with defective products than the consumer and encourages businesses to invest in the production of safer products. When the Restatement (Second) of Torts was published in 1965, Section 402A adopted the Greenman rule, providing a standard for product liability law. The section states that a seller, engaged in the business of selling such a product, is liable for harm caused to the consumer or their property if the defective product is unreasonably dangerous and the user is unaware of the danger. This provision applies even if the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product, and if the user should have been able to discover the defect. In summary, the Greenman rule, as encapsulated in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, was published in 1965. This was a direct result of the 1963 California Supreme Court decision in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., which led to the introduction and eventual widespread adoption of the principle of strict liability for defective products in American tort law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The vacancy is 10. Should I attend SSB for SSC(T) - 47? After how many days did is the merit list declared after conducting the SSB interview?","output":"While the two questions you've asked are related, they are not the same and address different aspects of the selection process for the Indian Army's Technical Graduate Course (TGC) and the Short Service Commission Technical (SSC-T). The first question seeks advice on whether you should attend the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47, given that you have already been recommended by SSB Bangalore for TGC-123 with a merit rank of 24 and a vacancy of 10.  Before answering this question, let's briefly discuss TGC and SSC(T) courses. Both TGC and SSC(T) are technical entries for engineering graduates in the Indian Army. The primary difference between the two lies in their commission type and service duration. TGC is a Permanent Commission (PC), whereas SSC(T) is a Short Service Commission (SSC), lasting for 10 years and extendable up to 14 years. My advice based on the information provided leans toward attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47. Here's why: 1. Competitive Merit Rank: Your merit rank for TGC-123 is 24, and the vacancy is 10. This suggests that your chances of being selected for TGC-123 may be slim due to the limited number of available slots. 2. Alternative Opportunity: By attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47, you are providing yourself with an alternative opportunity to join the Indian Army as a technical officer. Success in the SSC(T)-47 interview would increase your chances of being commissioned, even if you aren't selected for TGC-123. 3. Diversifying Options: Attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47 can help you better understand the selection process and improve your overall performance in SSB interviews. This experience can be valuable if you consider other commissioning avenues in the future. The second question is focused on the timeframe for the declaration of the merit list after the SSB interview. Typically, the merit list for the SSB interview is declared within 60 to 90 days after the conclusion of all the SSB interviews across different centers. However, this timeframe can vary based on the number of candidates, administrative processes, and other factors. It's essential to regularly check the official Indian Army website (joinindianarmy.nic.in) for updates on the merit list and other related information. In conclusion, while the two questions you asked are related, they seek different information pertinent to the TGC and SSC(T) selection processes. It is recommended that you attend the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47 to increase your chances of commissioning as a technical officer and gain valuable experience with the selection process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Dr. Glenn Tisman, a cancer specialist, knew his young neighbor, Ray Bateman, had an unusual mind. But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling  a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment. In 1988, 14 - year - old Ray went with Dr. Tisman to a meeting of the American Federation for Clinical Research(AFCR), where Ray presented their initial research findings. Using terminology  beyond the grasp of most kids his age, Ray told the scientists how the new drug mixture caused fewer and milder side effects for cancer patients. A year later, Ray returned to the meeting to update the findings of his and Dr. Tisman's research. By then, he had become well - known for his devotion to finding cures for sick patients. Stories about him appeared in hundred of newspapers around the world. He appeared on television newscasts and talk shows. Ray continued to spend most free hours working with Dr. Tisman. The two began studying the effects of vitamins on babies inside the womb . However, Ray's main interest remained cancer treatment, and he continues his research today.

Question: Information:  - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul).  - Pittsburgh is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which form the Ohio River, Pittsburgh is known as both \\"the Steel City\\" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, and as the \\"City of Bridges\\" for its 446 bridges. The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclines, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest. The mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.  - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Jones and Laughlin Steel Company began as the American Iron Company, founded in 1852 by Bernard Lauth and B. F. Jones, a few miles (c 4 km) south of Pittsburgh along the Monongahela River. Lauth's interest was bought in 1854 by James H. Laughlin.

Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries it had the privilege of a sanctuary, except against a writ of the Lord Chief Justice or of the Lords of the Privy Council; and as a result it was the refuge of the perpetrators of every grade of crime, debauchery, and offence against the laws. The execution of a warrant there, if at any time practicable, was attended with great danger, as all united in a maintenance in common of the immunity of the place. It was one of the last places of sanctuary used in England, abolished by Act of Parliament named \\"The Escape from Prison Act\\" in 1697 and a further Act in 1723. Eleven other places in London were named in the Acts (The Minories, The Mint, Salisbury Court, Whitefriars, Fulwoods Rents, Mitre Court, Baldwins Gardens, The Savoy, The Clink, Deadmans Place, Montague Close, and Stepney).  - Downtown Pittsburgh, colloquially referred to as the Golden Triangle and officially the Central Business District, is the urban downtown center of Pittsburgh.

The Marathi people have their own thriving film industry, and these productions can serve as useful educational tools in their own right. To make sure you’re able to absorb what you’re seeing, start with programs aimed at young viewers and work your way up from there. Play close attention to the dialogue and see how many words and phrases you can pick out from memory.  If possible, turn on the subtitles in your native language. Seeing the dialogue written out will help you create associations between what you hear and the meaning displayed on screen. Movies often depict normal people in normal situations, which means you’ll be getting a valuable glimpse of how the language is used in everyday life. Throw on a pair of headphones and jam out to some Bela Shende or Raja Hasan during your workout or on your walk home from school. Because of its uncomplicated lyrical structure and repetitive nature, popular music can help reinforce language skills without ever feeling like work. Another plus to using music as a study aid is that you can pause and rewind a song whenever you come to a section you don’t understand.  Maharashtra has produced many famous playback singers for Indian movies, so much of the music that comes out of the region contains vocals sung in Marathi. You can find recordings from many famous Marathi artists on websites like YouTube. Pick up a newspaper or magazine printed in Marathi and try to decipher as much as you can. This is great practice for going over the many symbols of the Marathi alphabet. As your comprehension improves, you can move onto more difficult material like novels and technical essays.  Focus on headlines, blurbs, and other short passages on your first few attempts to keep from being overwhelmed. Children’s books and nursery rhymes are perfect for brushing up on basic Marathi grammar. Ask someone who’s fluent in the language if they would be willing to help you practice by carrying on a short conversation. They’ll be able to adapt to your individual skill level, help you with your pronunciation, and gently correct your mistakes. When learning to speak an unfamiliar language, there’s no substitute for firsthand experience.  Many Indian people speak more than one dialect. It’s possible that your friend might have a good grasp of conversational Marathi, even if they’re not from Maharashtra. If you don’t personally know anyone who speaks Marathi, try making a new friend online who you can chat with via Skype or FaceTime.","output":"The article suggests learning Marathi language by starting with programs for kids, using subtitles, watching movies, listening to music, reading newspapers, practicing with fluent speakers, and making new friends online."},{"instruction":"Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What can feed at more than one trophic level?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life?  Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Both your puppy and your cat need a room in which they can adjust. You do not want to force a meeting right away. Give your pets separate care and attention for the first day or two.  You should usually confine the new pet initially, meaning you should keep your puppy in a separate room before letting her roam around the house. Make sure the room is stocked with adequate food, water, and toys. Make sure to spend plenty of time with your new puppy as she adjusts to your home. You should switch out which animal is confined. This will give them each a chance to explore the home. They can also get used to one another's smells, and become increasingly comfortable with the fact a new animal is present.  Rotate the animals every few hours. It's important the puppy has a chance to leave the room and explore a little, but you should not allow her free-range of the house yet, as this may interfere with potty training. Expand the area in which the puppy is confined to two or three rooms and watch her closely to watch for signs of toileting. When the animals are not confined, they may interact through the door. Your dog may, for example, sniff or paw at the door. For the most part, this is safe; however, if your puppy is excessively pawing at the door, correct the behavior. This can cause stress for your cat, leading to a messy introduction. It's very important the dog and the  cat get accustomed to one another's scent. You can swap small bits of bedding, like pillows or blankets. You can also exchange toys. Try rubbing a towel on one animal and putting the towel under the other animal's food dish. You should never leave your pets unsupervised before you've made many successful face-to-face introductions.   Make sure both the dog and cat are securely confined to separate areas when no one is home. You may wish tocrate train your puppy and keep her safely confined while you are out, allowing the cat free range (as he is presumably already comfortable in the house) If you secure the cat in a room while you're gone, make sure he has access to a litter box.","output":"Introducing a new puppy to a cat involves confining each separately, swapping their spaces to acclimatize them to each other's smells, trading bedding and toys, and gradual, supervised introductions, with both securely separated when left alone, to ensure a stress-free and successful familiarization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

American Airlines is facing a possible perfect storm of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, terrible labor relations with its pilots, delayed and canceled flights, aircraft seats that won't stay put and a growing number of reported flights diverted because of various problems midflight. Travel agents and customers who book their own travel are starting to question whether they should fly the airline. Who wants to fly American? More than 500 readers commented on CNN.com's story asking that question, many lamenting what they see as the decline of a once-proud airline and others reporting that other U.S. airlines aren't any better. Comments have been edited for clarity and brevity. Everyone has a bad airline story to share. \\"AA is my last option,\\" wrote Rick Ruiz. \\"Oldest jets in the fleet, every time I board one of their planes I feel like I just time traveled 20 to 30 years.

People who fly foreign airlines say the airline crews treat their customers better than their U.S. counterparts. \\"Singapore Airlines played with our children and fed them so my wife and I could eat our meals,\\" wrote Scott603. \\"They brought them toys once an hour and helped us get on/off the plane, on more than one trip,\\" he added. \\"Qatar brought my mother-in-law from the plane in JFK, through customs and immigration and right out to us, they are awesome!!\\" Calling in replacements. The airline blames the increasing list of canceled and delayed flights on its pilots union, after the company persuaded a bankruptcy judge last month to throw out the pilots' contract. The company says the pilots are calling in unnecessary repairs to slow down flights. \\"The NFL was just fine with replacement referees, so sure let's use replacement pilots and mechanics for American Airlines,\\" wrote OhRReally. \\"Maybe those brilliant corporate leaders at American Airlines should embrace the NFL model for skilled-employee labor disputes: call in the replacements!

This includes a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy, tense labor relations with its pilot community, numerous delayed and canceled flights, poorly installed seats on their aircrafts, and a high number of flights being diverted due to problems mid-flight.  2. A growing concern is surfacing among travel agents and customers about whether to continue choosing American Airlines for their travel needs, given its present state of affairs. Many feel the company's current issue marks the decline of a previously prestigious airline.  3. The dissatisfaction of customers is visible in their comments, sharing personal experiences ranging from exorbitant flight prices to poor customer service and outdated aircraft. Some have even suggested they would rather opt for other airlines, despite having had bad experiences with them as well. However, it's not all negative, as some passengers expressed their preference for American Airlines compared to other carriers. 4. There's a stated preference for foreign airlines that seem to provide better customer service. Airlines like Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways were cited for going the extra mile with their services. 5. The strained labor relations with pilots is also affecting the overall performance of the airline. This is because the airline blames the pilots union for an increasing list of canceled and delayed flights, arguing they are calling in unnecessary repairs to slow down flights. Some people have suggested the idea of hiring replacement pilots and mechanics. 6. Despite the complaints, some passengers are expressing sympathy and understanding for the airline and its employees, emphasizing the importance of American Airlines in maintaining competition in the industry in the US. 7. A couple of American Airline's employees chimed into the conversation to share their perspective and apologize for the disappointment caused, vouching for their commitment to providing the best service regardless of the circumstances. 8. There were also light-hearted suggestions to improve the situation, such as improving airline food by serving 'special brownies'. 9.

Some important people who help make decisions for our towns have agreed on a new idea. Let me tell you about it! So, there are these two areas called Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and Norfolk and Suffolk. The people who help make decisions for these places are called council leaders. They have thought of a plan to have two new elected mayors – one for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and another for Norfolk and Suffolk. Now, you might be wondering, \\"What is an elected mayor?\\" Well, an elected mayor is a person who gets chosen by the people, like your mommy and daddy, to help make important decisions and make sure everything in their town is working well. Just like when you chose your class leader, people in these towns will also pick their favorite person for the job, and that person will become their mayor. These two new mayors will be in charge of their own areas. One will look after Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and the other will take care of Norfolk and Suffolk. This will help make the towns better, because they will have their own leaders to focus just on their needs and make them even better places to live for you and your families. Now you might be thinking, \\"Why do they want two mayors?\\" That's a great question! These council leaders believe having two mayors would help the towns work smoothly, because each mayor will know so much about their own area and how to make it even better.  So, everyone is really excited about this plan! We can't wait to see who the new mayors will be, how they'll help make our towns better, and all the great things that will happen because of their work.

Question: Process: - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released -   Question: suppose more atoms split happens, how will it affect less neutrons are releases from the atom.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: More When more atoms undergo nuclear decay, the effect will typically result in a higher number of neutrons being released from the atoms. This occurs because the process of nuclear decay is directly linked to the behavior of neutrons in an unstable atomic nucleus. To understand this relationship, it's helpful to delve deeper into the types of decay, their processes, and the role of neutrons in these transformations. First and foremost, atomic nuclei contain protons and neutrons. The number of neutrons in a nucleus can impact the stability of an atom. Some atoms may have an excess of neutrons or too few of them, causing the atom to become unstable. There are primarily two types of decay processes that these unstable atoms can undergo: alpha decay and beta decay. 1. Alpha decay: In this decay process, the unstable atom's nucleus releases an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. The decay results in a new atom with a lower atomic number and fewer neutrons in the nucleus. This process is common in heavier, more massive atoms that need to lose mass to become stable. 2. Beta decay: This decay occurs when a neutron in the unstable nucleus transforms into a proton and electron. The proton stays in the nucleus, while the electron is ejected as a beta particle. This process is common in atoms that have too many neutrons compared to protons and need to achieve a more balanced configuration. Beta decay comes in two types: beta-minus decay, where a neutron turns into a proton and an electron, and beta-plus decay (or positron emission), where a proton turns into a neutron and a positron. Considering these decay processes, if more atoms were to split, it would result in an increased number of neutrons being released. This is because the release of neutrons is directly tied to the decay process of unstable atoms, which in turn impacts the stability and configuration of nuclei in these atoms. As more unstable atoms undergo these changes, the overall number of neutrons released into the environment will also increase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film revolves around the various off-camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic A-List cast. 'Soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era. The film is superbly led by Sally Field, as the neurotic ageing actress Celeste Talbert (She famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like \\"Gloria F*CKING Swanson!\\"). Her supporting cast reads like a who's-who of 90's Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all elevate the film greatly. Goldberg is predictably excellent, whilst Downey Jr.'s and Hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve. In terms of writing, the film is outstanding. There is a really modern edge to the script, which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time. In some ways, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' (1977). Much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, The extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by Carrie Fisher, is both hilarious and honest. 'Soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies Hollywood produced during the 1990's. It's excellent script and A-Class cast make it a must-see. It's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes.","output":"Based on the text, the correct sentiment is (ii) positive.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Horror movies and thrillers need to be your homework, because editing is finally the place where you get to create the real suspense. You could spend years studying editing, but a quick master-class of your favorite movies will do. For each scene, pull out a notepad and write down:  The length of cuts. Do they use long, slow shots, short and quick cuts, or a combination of both? When do they use each? How long is the scene, and at what point does each key event happen. You'll be surprised how similar this is in many movies. What are the music and sound cues? When do they come in, rise, and fall away? What is the lighting like? How does color, tone, and brightness affect the mood of the scene? Pay attention to the length of the cuts, and how the juxtapose against each other. While this rule isn't hard and fast, longer cuts tend to build dread and suspense, with shorter cuts breeding action, excitement, and confusion. This is a good way to play with tension and release -- a key to good suspense.  Watch how some movies \\"fake\\" the release, making you expect a scare, but actually providing nothing terrible (like a cat jumping out). This puts your audience on edge without blowing the big scare. Remember -- suspense comes from worrying about what is going to happen next, or seeing what is happening and being unable to stop it. Note how your favorite movies build this horror. Check the climactic basement scene near the end of The Silence of the Lambs for a master course in long takes punctuated by quick bursts of action. Sound is actually one of the best, if not the best, way to create tension and suspense. Why? Because it hints at things the viewer can't see, increasing worry, confusion, and dread. From floorboard creaks to the whistling of the wind, chirping crickets to sudden, heart-stopping silence, you can mine a lot more tension out of subtle sounds than most movie viewers ever realize.  You can find thousands of free sound effects online with a quick search. For serious movies, consider paying for access to a professional sound bank. Silence is key to suspense, especially when broken by a nerve-clenching noise like a sharpening blade, slowly opening door, or sudden breath or whisper. You can find hundreds of copyright-free suspense songs on the internet, generally using violins, piano, and ambient noises to build quiet dread. When using music, try to be sparing -- you want your scares to come from visual and sound design, using the music as a final touch to pull it together. Keep it in the background, barely perceptible, to subtly impact your audience without pulling their attention from the scene.  No Country for Old Men famously used no music at all, which created its own unique, silent suspense. Summary:","output":"Editing is crucial in creating suspense in horror movies and thrillers. By studying your favorite films, you can identify key elements such as the length of cuts, music and sound cues, and lighting that all contribute to the tension in a scene. Longer cuts often build dread, while shorter cuts create action and excitement. Some movies may \\"fake\\" a scare to keep the audience on edge, and suspense is generated through anticipation or the feeling of helplessness. Sound is an essential tool to create tension, with subtle noises hinting at unseen danger. Professional sound banks can provide high-quality effects, but free alternatives are available online. Silence can also be a powerful contributor to suspense, with sudden noises breaking the silence to create gripping moments. Using music sparingly lets visual and sound design take precedence in building dread; a good example of this is the film \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" which utilized no music at all, creating a unique silent suspense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every year, they celebrate the town's founding by participating in a friendly tournament, the Fairwood Baseball Bonanza, featuring players of all ages. With a rich history of successful baseball players coming out of the town, baseball has become more than just a game, but a way of life. The story revolves around Joe Sullivan, a 12-year-old kid with a passion for baseball. Joe grew up listening to his grandfather's tales of the old days and has always dreamt of participating in the Fairwood Baseball Bonanza. Unfortunately, his father, Tom Sullivan, an ex-professional baseball player, doesn't share his enthusiasm due to a career-ending injury that has built animosity within the family. In the days leading up to the tournament, a mysterious ball pops up behind home plate while Joe practices with his team. This sends the town gossiping and speculating about the origin of the ball. It is rumored to be a legendary ball, said to have been used by the town's founding father, Walter Fairwood, during baseball's infancy. However, nobody has seen the ball in decades, and it was widely believed to have vanished into thin air. Joe and his friends embark on an adventure to uncover the ball's origins, exploring Fairwood's history and meeting various characters from the town's past. Along the way, they learn about the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and the love of the game. Joe discovers the hidden stories of his father's baseball career and his grandfather's cherished memories, realizing that there's more to the game than just winning. During their quest, Tom uncovers his love for baseball again and starts sharing left-out stories with Joe, reconstructing their relationship. Eventually, the ball's true origins are revealed to be connected with the Sullivan family legacy. As the tournament begins, the entire town comes together to cheer on their friends and family. Guided by the newfound bond between Joe and his father, the team enters the championship game with a renewed sense of camaraderie and determination. In the final moments of the game, Joe, inspired by the legendary ball, hits a game-winning home run, solidifying his place in the town's history. The Hidden Ball is an exploration of family, history, and the power of baseball in uniting a community. The journey takes the audience through a tale of love, forgiveness, and self-discovery as the characters are brought together by the legendary ball that once seemed like just a myth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Paul Heyman was born on September 11, 1965 in Westchester County, New York, to Richard S. Heyman (died June 25, 2013), a prominent personal injury attorney, and Sulamita Heyman (died February 27, 2009). His family was Jewish, and his mother was a Holocaust survivor. By age 11, he was running a mail order business selling celebrity and sports memorabilia from his home. While still a teenager, he fast-talked his way backstage at a World Wide Wrestling Federation event at Madison Square Garden as a photojournalist. Context: After departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr.. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed.  At this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Eastern Championship Wrestling, which he did under the ownership of a local pawn shop owner named Tod Gordon. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews, but Gilbert's erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the \\"Ultra Clash\\" event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including Sabu and 911.  A year later, the company was the flagship promotion of the struggling NWA. A tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion Shane Douglas becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president Dennis Coralluzzo to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its \\"tradition\\" after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title's lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a \\"dead organization\\" and declaring his ECW title a world-level championship. The plan for this shoot screwjob was known only to those three.  That same week, Heyman and Tod Gordon rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding \\"Eastern\\" and declaring the promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in Vince McMahon's WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as Terry Gordy and 2 Cold Scorpio. McMahon paid Heyman 1,000 per week to rent Scorpio.  In the final days of ECW, Heyman did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for 2,000,000, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over 100 million in debt), with the company 7,000,000 in arrears, with over 3,000,000 owed to the company by InDemand pay per view. Question: What happened at the Ultra Clash event? Answer:","output":"At the Ultra Clash event on September 18, 1993, Eddie Gilbert's erratic behavior had reached a boiling point, leading to a major falling out with Tod Gordon, the owner of the Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). This incident led to Paul Heyman taking charge of the creative direction of the company, which was a significant turning point in the history of ECW. The event itself, Ultra Clash, was an important showcase for the promotion, featuring several notable matches and feuds. Some key moments from the Ultra Clash event include: 1. A \\"Loser Gets a Haircut\\" match between JT Smith and Tony Stetson, where Smith emerged victorious, leading to Stetson getting his head shaved. 2. A \\"Singapore Cane Match\\" between Tommy Cairo and The Sandman, which Cairo won, earning the right to strike The Sandman multiple times with a Singapore cane. This was an early glimpse into the hardcore and extreme style of wrestling that ECW would become famous for in later years. 3. A \\"Battle Royal\\" featuring several ECW wrestlers, won by Glenn Osbourne, showcasing the talent within the promotion and further establishing its roster. 4. The main event of the evening, featuring The Dark Patriot (Doug Gilbert) defeating JT Smith in a singles match. While the specific details of Gilbert's falling out with Gordon at Ultra Clash are not well-documented, the event marks a crucial turning point in the history of ECW, with Heyman taking the reins of the company, paving the way for the innovation and extreme style of wrestling that the company is known for today. Under Heyman's leadership, the promotion eventually broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and rebranded itself as Extreme Championship Wrestling, evolving into a groundbreaking and influential force within the professional wrestling industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints  . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

The figure turns around and we are introduced to Lilya (Oksana Akinshina), who has recently been badly beaten.The movie is about Lilya's past.Lilya lives a fairly bleak life with her mother in a run down apartment block in a poor town in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union. Lilya is a normal teenage girl albeit poor and pretty impoverished. Lilya's mother (Lyubov Agapova) informs Lilya that they are emigrating to the US with her new boyfriend. At the last minute, Lilya is left behind in the care of her aunt Anna (Liliya Shinkaryova). She is forced to move into a dirty flat (whilst her aunt moved into the bigger and nicer flat that Lilya and her mother used to live in) is just the beginning and a succession of miseries are thrust upon Lilya. Lilya's best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for some extra cash but Lilya decides not to. However, when the friend's father finds money made from prostitution, the friend claims that she was the one sat at the bar whilst Lilya was out sleeping with men for the money. Not only is Lilya's reputation at home ruined but the story begins to spread throughout the school. Now abandoned, Lilya has to turn to prostitution to help her get money together. One glimmer of hope comes in the form of Volodya (Artyom Bogucharskiy), who she forms a close friendship with. He is also abused and rejected by his alcoholic father. Lilya buys him a basketball with the money earned from her prostitution that week but Volodya's father pops it. Lilya's hope is once again reignited in the form of Andrei (Pavel Ponomaryov) who becomes her boyfriend and offers her a job in Sweden.After arriving in Sweden, Lilya is introduced to her future 'employer' (in reality, he is a pimp) and taken to a nearby empty apartment where he imprisons her.

(CNN) -- A conservative billionaire businessman and a former center-left president will face off in a runoff election in Chile's presidential race, based on official early results released Sunday.  With more than 98 percent of polling stations counted, billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera led ex-president Eduardo Frei with 44 percent of the vote to Frei's 30 percent, Chile's interior ministry reported.  \\"This is a victory for all the Chileans who want change,\\" Pinera said Sunday night.

Mercury's axis is tilted; (iii). the gravitational pull of Pluto on the southern hemisphere; (iv). lyrics about winter by popular musicians always mention bundling up;","output":"The correct answer is: (i). our planet's axis is tilted. Explanation: Earth's tilt on its axis causes different parts of the world to receive different amounts of sunlight during the year, creating seasons. In December, in the northern hemisphere, the Earth's tilt causes it to receive less sunlight, making it colder and creating winter. That's why we need to wear heavy clothing during the winter months. Wrong answers: (ii). Mercury's axis has nothing to do with Earth's seasons. Seasons happen on Earth because of Earth's tilt, not other planets' tilt. (iii). Pluto's gravitational pull is very weak and does not significantly affect Earth's tilt or seasons.  (iv). Lyrics about winter by musicians are just their way of expressing feelings and experiences during that time, but they don't cause the cold weather; it's the other way around (cold weather inspires lyrics)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Answer: A diesel-powered submarine would release less pollution when running on its battery backup power. Explanation: Plug-in hybrids, as mentioned in the passage, run for a longer time on electricity and are less polluting than regular hybrids. In the case of a diesel-powered submarine, when running on its diesel engine, it combusts diesel fuel which releases pollutants into the environment. However, when running on its battery backup power, the submarine relies on the stored electrical energy, resulting in zero direct emissions.

Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American television personality and business woman. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification.  Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\".

Expand this summary.","output":"On October 30, 2014, Pennsylvania and federal law enforcement officers finally captured fugitive Eric Frein after an intense manhunt lasting seven weeks. Frein had been on the run in the Poconos Mountains after being accused of the shooting of two state troopers. As officers led him from the courthouse today, the New York Times reports that they halted for a moment, seemingly giving the roughly 150 bystanders a good look at the suspect. Angry shouts of \\"Rot in hell,\\" \\"You're not a real soldier,\\" and \\"You're a coward\\" were hurled at Frein, who displayed no reaction. Frein had been arraigned on charges of murder, attempted murder, and possession of weapons of mass destruction in connection to the attack on the troopers and his time spent evading capture. According to a federal law enforcement official who spoke with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Frein had been anticipating his inevitable arrest. The source revealed that the fugitive had spent a significant amount of time in a hangar at the small airport where he was ultimately caught. Contrary to some rumors, the US Marshals were not acting on a tip when they discovered Frein outside the hangar. The Scranton Times-Tribune reports that they had been employing a grid strategy of searching throughout the manhunt and simply followed through on their procedure in that particular area. Frein was found unarmed at the time of his capture. When queried about the noticeable gash on Frein's nose and bruises on his face, a police official stated that the injuries had not occurred during or after his arrest. Interestingly, the handcuffs used to restrain Frein belonged to the state trooper who lost his life in the shooting incident. The capture of Eric Frein had been a top priority for law enforcement in Pennsylvania and nationwide. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, and the manhunt for him ultimately involved more than 1,000 officers from multiple agencies across the state. Despite the substantial resources invested in tracking him down, Frein had managed to evade authorities for an extended period by taking refuge in the dense woodland of the Pocono Mountains.

Answer the following question: Information:  - An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.  - Night skiing is the sport of skiing or snowboarding after sundown, offered at many ski resorts and mountains. There are usually electric lights  including LED lamps  along the piste which allow for better visibility. It typically begins after a resort's skiing-day ends (sunset), and ends between 8:00 and 10:30 p.m.  - Sunset or sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon as a result of Earth's rotation. The Sun will set exactly due west at the equator on the the spring and fall equinoxes, each of which occurs only once a year.  The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the trailing edge of the Sun's disk disappears below the horizon. Near to the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes the ray path of light from the Sun to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the Sun's disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when sunset is observed.   - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area  a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.  - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\".

Movie title: Breach Movie plot: Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is a young FBI employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a sexual deviant. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \\"shoot guns\\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. He learns that FBI Director Louis Freeh is personally leading the investigation. While the FBI could arrest Hanssen under lesser charges, they want to catch him in an act of espionage, so they can threaten him with the death penalty for treason and possibly induce him to divulge the information he has compromised.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Breach,\\" it is Eric O'Neill, portrayed by Ryan Phillippe, who provides assurance to Robert Hanssen, played by Chris Cooper, that he's not being trailed by Russians or the FBI. O'Neill is a young FBI employee who is assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Hanssen, initially under the pretense of investigating him for being a sexual deviant. However, as O'Neill becomes closer to Hanssen, he learns of the true purpose of his assignment: the FBI suspects Hanssen has been spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years, and has caused the deaths of American agents. As O'Neill gets to know Hanssen, he initially finds no concrete evidence of Hanssen's double life. In the process, O'Neill starts to develop respect for his boss, and they form a bond. O'Neill plays a crucial role in allaying Hanssen's suspicions about being trailed by the Russians or the FBI. This trust between Hanssen and O'Neill is essential for the FBI to collect more evidence against Hanssen and ultimately catch him in the act of espionage. Toward the end of the movie, O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's Palm Pilot, while keeping him occupied as other FBI agents search Hanssen's car. It is during this critical period that O'Neill's role in assuring Hanssen that he is not being trailed by anyone becomes paramount in order to maintain Hanssen's trust and ultimately bring him down."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Sentence 1: \\"there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh\\" 2. Compare Sentence 1 to the provided genres:    - Face-to-face: The sentence could be part of a face-to-face conversation, as it contains informal language and filler words like \\"uh\\" and \\"excuse me.\\"    - Telephone: It could also be part of a telephone dialogue due to the informal language and filler words. 3. Compare Sentence 1 to Sentence 2 and their genres:    Sentence 2: \\"There's bumble patterns there.\\" and its genre is 'telephone.' 4. Determine if they fit the same genre:    Sentence 1 could fit either 'face-to-face' or 'telephone' genres, while Sentence 2 is explicitly from the 'telephone' genre. Since the two sentences can both belong to the 'telephone' genre, the answer is: Y (Yes, they can belong to the same genre)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hypothesis: Jose was a new soldier in the army at the time","output":"Drawing the hypothesis that Private First Class Jose F. Valdez was a new soldier in the army at the time depends on the contextual background provided and the analysis of key information within that context. Based on the provided context, we can gather some supporting and opposing information for this hypothesis: Supporting points: 1. The rank of Private First Class in the United States Army is typically associated with soldiers who have been recently promoted after completing basic training. This could be an indication that Jose was relatively new to the army at the time. 2. By considering his birth date (January 3, 1925) and his date of death (February 17, 1945), we can deduce that he was 20 years old when he died. Depending on when he enlisted, this could support the idea that he was new to the army at the time. Opposing points: 1. His date of enlistment is not provided in the context. It is possible that he could have enlisted earlier in the war and had more experience than this hypothesis suggests. 2. The fact that he received the Medal of Honor posthumously demonstrates that he performed heroic actions during the Battle of the Colmar Pocket. This level of skill and bravery might be an indication of a more experienced soldier rather than a new one. 3. World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945. Given that the Battle of the Colmar Pocket occurred during this time, it is possible that Jose could have been in the army for some time before his death. Without information about his length of service, it is difficult to ascertain whether he was a new soldier or not. Based on the context provided, we can see that there exist both supporting and opposing points that could justify the hypothesis that Private First Class Jose F. Valdez was a new soldier in the army at the time. However, without more information, specifically his enlistment date and length of service, it is difficult to conclusively confirm or refute this hypothesis. To get a more conclusive answer, we would need additional information about Jose's military career, including how long he had served in the United States Army and any other relevant data that could help determine his level of experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Low-income domestic violence victims may find long-term legal help -- representation in divorces or child-custody disputes -- hard to come by, if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost funding. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than 450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child custody, child support, custody and property arrangements for 150 days. Many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time, Milne and Ralphs said. \\"The likelihood a victim will return to her abuser increases if she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish workable support, custody and property arrangements,\\" the funding request to CVR said. The Department of Justice said it denied the grant application, in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration between the organizations and victims' advocates, Ralphs and Milne told CVR board members. While the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well, the organizations cannot appeal the grant denial. Although CVR board members considered giving the money as a loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after Milne and Ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous.

Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Calvin's view of democracy is rooted in his belief in a combination of aristocracy and democracy as the ideal political system. He valued the democratic principle of allowing people to elect their authorities and overlords freely, considering it an invaluable gift from God. Calvin believed that rulers who went against God's divine will should be deposed, as they lost their divine right to rule. To safeguard the rights and liberties of ordinary people, he advocated for a separation of powers through a system of checks and balances, which played a crucial role in resisting political absolutism and contributed to the development of modern democracy. Calvinism's impact on democracy was evident in the 17th and 18th centuries, notably in the Netherlands, which emerged as one of the freest nations in Europe under Calvinist leadership. The country offered asylum to prominent philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle.

Process:  - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather gets cold enough happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If the weather gets cold enough to cause a significant drop in temperature beyond the normal range for hibernation, it may adversely affect the animal's ability to hibernate properly. The potential impact of this perturbation can be explained through various factors: 1. Insufficient energy reserves: If the cold weather arrives earlier than expected or lasts longer than usual, the animal might not have enough time to consume and store sufficient food and energy reserves required for the entire hibernation period. Insufficient energy reserves can lead to malnourishment or even death during hibernation. 2. Difficulty finding or building a suitable den: Drastic or unexpected drops in temperature can make it challenging for animals to locate or build an appropriate den in a timely manner. In extreme cases, animals might enter hibernation without access to a proper den, leading to increased vulnerability to predators, temperature, and moisture fluctuations. 3. Disrupted hibernation cycles: Extreme cold or sudden changes in temperature could disturb the animal's normal hibernation cycle. Frequent disruptions in hibernation cycles can result in increased energy usage and overall stress on the animal. 4. Potential health issues: While hibernating, the animal relies on its physiological adaptations to survive for extended periods without food, water, or elimination of waste. Inadequate hibernation conditions can lead to health problems resulting from limited energy reserves, impaired immune responses, or other biological responses to the cold and lack of resources. 5. Challenges upon emerging: If the extreme cold affects the distribution or availability of food sources upon the animal's emergence from hibernation, it might face challenges in replenishing energy reserves and recovering from the hibernation period. In conclusion, the perturbation caused by extremely cold weather can have both direct and indirect effects on an animal's ability to hibernate properly. These effects can manifest through disruptions in hibernation cycles, inadequate living conditions, insufficient energy reserves, health issues, and challenges faced upon the animal's emergence from hibernation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Sinead O'Connor's Advice to Miley Cyrus: Social Media Weighs In Introduction In a recent open letter to Miley Cyrus, Irish singer Sinead O'Connor shared her concerns about the direction the young pop star has taken in her career, urging her to stop allowing herself to be \\"pimped\\" and exploited by the music industry. O'Connor's comments, which come on the heels of Cyrus' controversial and provocative performances and music videos, have ignited a heated discussion on social media. Are O'Connor's concerns for Miley Cyrus valid, and do they have any bearing on our lives? We took to Twitter to find out. Background Sinead O'Connor's letter advised Miley Cyrus to be wary of those around her who might be taking advantage of her youth and vulnerability for financial gain. Referring to Cyrus' recent raunchy performances and revealing outfits, O'Connor wrote: \\"When you partake in allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping, nothing but harm will come out of it in the long run.\\" Social Media Reaction As soon as the letter went public, social media users began to weigh in on O'Connor's concerns and advice to Cyrus, with reactions ranging from agreement to apathy, and criticism to confusion. Some Twitter users expressed their support for O'Connor's message, appreciating the fact that she had taken the time to voice her concerns about the young star's wellbeing. \\"Sinead O'Connor's letter to Miley Cyrus is a perfect example of how women should look out for each other. It's heartfelt, powerful, and necessary,\\" @johndoewriter wrote. Others, however, felt that O'Connor's involvement was unwarranted and unwelcome, suggesting that the young pop star is simply following her own path in the industry. \\"@MileyCyrus is definitely not the first artist to shock and push boundaries. Sinead O'Connor's letter is a waste of time,\\" @musiclover123 commented. Surprisingly, some Twitter users admitted they had not previously been fans of O'Connor, but her letter to Cyrus had piqued their interest. \\"@SineadOconnorHQ was never on my radar until I read her letter to Miley Cyrus. Listening now and can't believe I was missing out on her music,\\" @newfan2021 tweeted. The Impact on our Lives What's evident is that O'Connor's comments have struck a chord with people on social media, as evidenced by the wide range of reactions. However, the larger issue her letter raises is the debate over the potential exploitation of young artists in the entertainment industry, and whether we as a society should be more mindful of our own role in the \\"pimping\\" process. Beyond the direct advice to Cyrus, O'Connor's plea can be seen as an appeal to all of us to consider our responsibility for promoting and supporting an industry that can be harmful. By consuming media that exploits young artists or promotes harmful stereotypes, are we complicit in perpetuating this culture of exploitation? Conclusion While opinions on Sinead O'Connor's letter to Miley Cyrus may be divided, it's undeniable that her comments have started a conversation about the treatment of young artists in the music industry. As consumers, we have the power to drive change by choosing what content we support and engage with. It is a reminder that we have a role to play in shaping the messages and values within our popular culture. Now, we want to hear from you!

Günümüz Sırbistan'ında yoksulluk ve işsizlik, ülkenin başlıca sosyal sorunlarından bazılarını teşkil etmektedir. Bu sosyal zorluklar, hem hükûmetin ve yerel yönetimlerin hem de sivil toplum kuruluşlarının odak noktasında yer almaktadır. Sırbistan'da ekonomik durgunluk ve istikrarsızlık, uzun yıllardır süren iç çatışmalar ve uluslararası yaptırımların ardından, bu sorunların ortaya çıkmasına katkıda bulunan başlıca etkenler haline gelmiştir. Öncelikle, yoksulluk, Sırbistan nüfusunun önemli bir kısmını etkileyen bir sorundur. Yoksulluk sınırının altında yaşayan çok sayıda kişi bulunmakta ve bu durum, eğitim, sağlık ve yaşam kalitesi üzerinde olumsuz etkiler yaratmaktadır. Yetersiz sosyal güvence ve gelir dağılımındaki adaletsizlik, yoksulluğun daha da artmasına yol açmaktadır. İşsizlik ise Sırbistan ekonomisi için oldukça önemli bir problemdir. Ülke genelinde işsizlik oranı yüksek seviyelerde seyretmekte olup, genç nüfus üzerinde daha büyük bir etkisi olmaktadır. İş imkanlarının azlığı ve eğitim sistemiyle iş piyasasının ihtiyaçları arasındaki uyumsuzluk, işsizliğin önemli nedenlerinden bazılarıdır. İşsizlik, ekonomik olarak geri kalmış bölgelerde yaşayan insanların, daha fazla iş olanaklarını arayarak büyük şehirler ve yurtdışına göç etmesine yol açmaktadır. Hükûmet ve yerel yönetimler, bu sorunları çözmeye yönelik politikalar ve projeler üzerinde çalışmaktadır. Yoksullukla mücadele etmek için sosyal yardım programlarını ve işsizlik sigortasını genişletme, eğitim ve sağlık hizmetlerini yaygınlaştırma ve iyileştirme ve ekonomik fırsatlar yaratma stratejileri benimsemektedirler. Ayrıca, işsizlikle mücadelede, istihdam yaratma ve işgücü eğitimi gibi alanlarda yapısal reformlar gerçekleştirme ve iş piyasasına uyumlu eğitim fırsatları sağlama yoluyla bu soruna çözüm getirmek amaçlanmaktadır. Sivil toplum kuruluşları ve uluslararası örgütler de Sırbistan'ın bu sosyal sorunlarıyla başa çıkma çabalarına destek olmaktadır.

Movie title: Bardelys the Magnificent Context: Bardelys is a wealthy courtier in the court of Louis XIII, with a string of affairs with beautiful women, and a silver tongue. In the middle of a duel with a wronged husband, he manages to reconcile the couple and get them out of his rooms before they discover a more recent conquest hidden behind a door. Meanwhile, Chatellerault, another courtier, has been rejected by the beautiful Roxalanne, whose family opposes the king. Chatellerault returns to find the court laughing at him, and he bullies Bardelys into a bet that he cannot win and marry Roxalanne. His honor at stake, Bardelys travels to Roxalanne's castle, but is wounded en route and is mistaken for a rebel leader. He keeps up the ruse, as Bardelys' womanizing reputation would interfere with his plans. But, falling in love with Roxalanne, he cannot bring himself to marry her under a false name, and plans to return to announce that he's lost the bet. His refusal to pledge his love upsets Roxalanne, who turns him over to the king's guards. The only judge at his trial who knows his true name is Chatellerault, who sentences him to death under the rebel's name. Roxalanne agrees to marry Chatellerault in exchange for Bardelys' life, but Chatellerault still fails to intervene. On the gallows, Bardelys effects an impressive escape, and the king arrives and vouches for his identity. Confronting Chatellerault in a duel, he renders the newly married Roxalanne a widow, and receives the king's blessing on their impending marriage.

Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance.

The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem.

These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden.

You'll notice by the stars I've given this GREAT film that '...before you see it the first time,' is implied. I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). I'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it did. This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. I would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. I don't hold that against this film too much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well. Jeremy Northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam would/could/should fit that bill. He's suave and cultured. He's got a great Bond posture and voice. I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-Earth, as well.

The Stromboli's Puppet show Answer:","output":"Title: Strings Attached Genre: Fantasy/Adventure/Coming-of-age Plot: Once upon a time, in a small, magical village, lived a kind-hearted woodcarver named Geppetto. Geppetto longed for nothing more than to have a child of his own. His wish was granted when a shooting star brought life to one of his most incredible creations - Pinocchio. Pinocchio was no ordinary marionette, for, unlike other puppets, he could move and speak without the support of strings. However, there was one catch; if Pinocchio wanted to become a real boy, he had to prove that he had a pure heart and be free from deceit and lies. The adventure begins when Pinocchio comes across an enchanted map, revealing the whereabouts of the legendary Stromboli's Puppet Show. This magical show was known to bestow unlimited potential and success upon the talented puppets who graced its stage. Intrigued by the prospect of fulfilling his dream to become a real boy, Pinocchio decides to embark on a journey to find the famous puppet show and join its crew of talented marionettes. During his journey, Pinocchio meets Felix the Fox and Whiskers the Cat, two cunning and mischievous animals. They convince Pinocchio that joining Stromboli's Puppet Show will not only grant him an opportunity to showcase his unique skills, but it also could hold the key to solving his problem. By becoming Stromboli's star performer, Pinocchio would earn fame, wealth, and, he is led to believe, the secret to becoming a real boy. Blinded by the promise of transforming into a real boy, Pinocchio follows Felix and Whiskers to the enchanted Puppet Master Stromboli's castle. Upon arriving, Pinocchio, Felix, and Whiskers are welcomed by the charismatic Stromboli, the master puppeteer who can animate puppets with a single touch of his magical wand. Stromboli recognizes Pinocchio's talent and potential and lavishes him with praise and admiration, promising that he would make him the star of his show. As the days pass, Pinocchio becomes increasingly blinded by the glitz and glamour of his newfound fame. He begins to neglect his father, Geppetto, and indulges in the deceptive and nefarious antics influenced by Felix and Whiskers. His nose grows progressively longer with each lie, symbolizing the strings that are pulling him further away from his true self and the possibility of becoming a real boy. Realizing that Pinocchio’s purity and innocence are slipping away, the Blue Fairy, the guardian of wishes, intervenes. The Blue Fairy reveals to Pinocchio that his newfound life is nothing but an illusion, and by pursuing fame and fortune, he has strayed far from the path that could lead to his transformation into a real boy. She further warns him that when the last petal falls from a magical rose that she leaves behind, his chance to become a real boy will be lost forever. Desperate to right his wrongs, Pinocchio, along with the help of his loyal friend and conscience, Jiminy Cricket, embarks on a heartwarming journey to break free from Stromboli’s control and put an end to his manipulative strings. Along the way, Pinocchio learns the importance of honesty, bravery, and love, proving that he has a pure heart beneath the wooden exterior. As the last rose petal falls, the Blue Fairy, moved by Pinocchio's unwavering courage and pure heart, grants him his ultimate wish - transforming him into a real boy. Reunited with his father Geppetto, Pinocchio finally understands that the true meaning of becoming a \\"real boy\\" lies in being honest, kind, and loving. Together, they celebrate as the magic of their love and devotion brings light to the once-dark village, proving that even the most flawed and imperfect beings can learn, change, and ultimately become real in the eyes of those who love them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He argues that this campaign was orchestrated to undermine his team's efforts in assessing Iraq's compliance with the UN's disarmament requirements, ultimately paving the way for the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Blix, who served as the UN's chief weapons inspector from 2000 to 2003, was tasked with overseeing the inspection and eventual dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. During this period, he frequently voiced his concerns and doubts about the presence of WMDs in Iraq, despite the insistence of the U.S. and its allies that the threat posed by such weapons justified military intervention. In response to Blix's skepticism, some U.S. officials allegedly waged a smear campaign targeting him and his fellow inspectors, accusing them of incompetence and even collusion with the Iraqi government. In his statement, Blix contends that the campaign against him was designed to discredit the UNMOVIC and to silence any dissenting opinions concerning the necessity of the invasion. He points out that, in some cases, baseless accusations were circulated in the media, questioning his team's integrity and professionalism, and sowing doubt about their willingness to cooperate with the U.S. government. \\"These false claims,\\" Blix asserts, \\"were deliberately crafted to manipulate public opinion and to build a case for invasion based on lies and deceit.\\" The former UN chief weapons inspector further claims that those responsible for the smear campaign bore a personal vendetta against him, fueled by his outspoken opposition to the war. He accuses high-ranking U.S. officials of orchestrating a systematic attack on his credibility to secure support for an invasion that he believes did not have adequate basis in fact. \\"The smears against me and my colleagues were not simply misplaced criticism,\\" Blix states, \\"but part of a concerted effort to reinforce a predetermined narrative and to undermine the impartiality and independence of the UN inspections process.\\" Blix's statement has reignited the debate surrounding the legitimacy of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the motivations of those who supported it. As the evidence regarding the existence of WMDs in Iraq proved to be unfounded, many critics have decried the invasion as based on falsehoods and politically motivated manipulations. Blix's testimony adds fuel to the fire, suggesting that a deliberate campaign was waged against those who questioned the invasion's rationale, with the goal of silencing them and furthering the pro-intervention agenda. The impact of Blix's accusations remains to be seen, but their consequences could be far-reaching if it prompts further investigation into the conduct of officials involved in promoting the invasion. It seems clear that Blix's statement is not only an indictment of certain members of the U.S. government but also a call for greater scrutiny of the motivations behind the Iraq war. As the world continues to grapple with the consequences of this conflict, the revelation of a smear campaign against those who sought the truth about Iraq's WMD program further complicates an already contentious political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Subtract 61x from 64x. 0 = 3x + 15 Step 3: In order to isolate x, we need to move the constant term, 15, to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 15 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 15 = 3x + 15 - 15 Step 4: Simplify the left and right sides of the equation. -15 = 3x Step 5: Now we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. -15 / 3 = 3x / 3 Step 6: Simplify the left and right sides of the equation. -5 = x So the solution for the equation is x = -5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base... Answer:","output":"Daniel Defoe visited the Chat Moss area in 1724, as mentioned in the article. He encountered this great bog or waste on his way from Warrington to Manchester. The area was difficult to traverse due to its inability to bear the weight of horses or humans unless it was an exceedingly dry season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Input: With this in mind, is it the perfect natural habitat for Conservatives? If you look at a map of the county, it certainly appears to be true blue, with the main exception of the western fringes which border Merseyside. When you look behind the numbers, though, Labour seems to have a good chance of painting more of Cheshire red. The constituency of Weaver Vale is currently held, with a majority of 991, by Graham Evans for the Conservatives. Whilst his party may feel at home in Tory-leaning areas like Frodsham and its rural hinterland, his biggest challenge comes from the part of his patch which includes Runcorn, where Labour have all but five of the 56 seats on the local council. Most of Runcorn and neighbouring Widnes are served by the traditionally safe Labour seat of Halton. That constituency, as well as Ellesmere Port and Neston and Warrington North include areas of considerable deprivation. Warrington South, where the Conservatives' David Mowat is defending a majority of 1,553, is also a key target for Labour. But in 2010 the Liberal Democrat vote meant the seat was a three-way marginal, and the continued popularity of the party in local council elections over the last four years adds another element of uncertainty. If Labour don't take the likes of Warrington South and Weaver Vale, their chances of being the biggest party in Westminster after the general election on 7 May look very shaky. The City of Chester, meanwhile, is the kind of seat Labour needs to secure in order to have any hope of gaining an outright majority. Tory Stephen Mosley has a majority of 5.5% but the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft's polls in the city are looking good for Labour. Lord Ashcroft predicted they would take the seat with a lead of 1% back in October, but a few weeks ago he had them leading with 11% - so high that local Conservatives wrote it off as a rogue poll. The Green Party does not have a history of electoral representation in Cheshire, but across the west of the county it will be hoping to capitalise on the controversy surrounding a number of sites given licenses for hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking. There will not be much of a media focus on the safe Tory seats of Macclesfield or Chancellor George Osborne's Tatton, where he enjoys a majority of more than 14,000. Edward Timpson even looks relatively safe in Gwyneth Dunwoody's former Labour stronghold of Crewe and Nantwich. But in Congleton and the mostly rural constituency of Eddisbury the focus may not be on the 2015 general election but that of 2020. UKIP say they have high hopes of coming second in these seats, helped by a combination of disaffected Tories and traditional Labour voters voting tactically in the aim of upsetting the Conservatives. The Lib Dems nearly tied with Labour in those safer Tory seats in 2010, and with the party widely expected to shed votes the difficult question now is which party will pick them up. Labour will be leading its march eastwards with its national rallying cries about the supposed \\"privatisation\\" of the NHS and, as they put it, the cost of living crisis. But it will be directing those appeals not just at those in more deprived parts of Chester, Runcorn and Warrington - but also at those across the county who regards themselves as being part of what they call the \\"squeezed middle\\". The Tories can point to the fact that a lot of jobs have been created in Cheshire under the coalition government, and bad news stories like the exit of AstraZeneca from its base near Macclesfield appears to have been turned into good news about the site's future. But both parties have two very difficult issues to deal with in the county - the incursion of house builders into the countryside at a time when more houses need to be built, and the role Cheshire may or may not play in the Northern Powerhouse.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose inventions always fail? from the following article ?  Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.","output":"The name of the person whose inventions always fail in the given article is Ishbo."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind.

Answer: King Ferdinand initially refused to go to Madrid and decided to travel to Valencia instead. Upon his arrival in Valencia on 17 April, General Elio approached the King and encouraged him to reclaim his absolute rights. General Elio offered the support of his troops for the King's cause, essentially putting the military power at Ferdinand's disposal. Subsequently, Ferdinand decided to take action and abolished the Constitution of 1812. In an attempt to further consolidate his power, the King dissolved the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May. This marked the beginning of an absolutist rule in Spain, which lasted for six years from 1814 to 1820. However, the political atmosphere in Spain did not remain constant during this period. The constitution was eventually restored during a phase called the Trienio Liberal, which spans from 1820 to 1823.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"?","output":"Question: According to the passage, what are the two main arguments for affirmative action as identified by Terry Eastland, and what are some potential negative consequences of affirmative action as highlighted by Thomas Sowell?

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What are formed where crevasses meet? Context: The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs. A:","output":"Seracs are formed where crevasses meet.

You will be given a task.

Let's dive deeper into some possible sentiment interpretations: 1. Frustration or Disappointment: The primary sentiment that comes to mind when reading \\"and I can't eat any of it\\" is frustration or disappointment. The speaker seems to be in a situation where they are faced with food (or metaphorically a situation) they can't partake in for one reason or another. This sort of sentiment is common for people who are facing dietary restrictions due to health issues or personal choices. 2. Envy or Sadness: This sentiment also suggests feelings of envy or sadness. The author may be in a situation where they see others being able to freely enjoy something that they cannot. This could be a situation like a party or a gathering where they are unable to eat due to various reasons such as dietary restrictions, allergies, religious reasons, or personal preferences, making them feel left out. 3. Resignation or Indignation: Another way to interpret this sentiment is a sense of resignation or indignation. This can be inferred if the author is faced with a predicament where they must abstain from eating something desirable against their will, which could result from situations like a mandatory diet, fasting, or medical restrictions. However, without further context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the sentiment of this tweet. Sentiment analysis often depends heavily on additional information such as what preceded this sentence, the overall topic, or even the general tone of the person’s other social media posts. Moreover, it is crucial to note that understanding sentiment also calls for an understanding of cultural, social and personal nuances. What might sound negative or positive in one context could mean something entirely different in another. Hence, while estimates can be made about the sentiment of the tweet being negative pertaining to feelings of inability or restriction, the precise emotional undertone would require more specific context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Im so glad I can update my review of this place...  Let me tell you all the past and what happened this past week.    My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at.     Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well.  What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up.  For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that.  But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no .75 more.  What??  When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.    Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about 2.00.  So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge .75?  WOW.  She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power.  She kindly mentioned that she was a regular customer and this is the first she's been charged for this. He rudely replied \\"well we have to charge for milk since you dont want ice.  Do you want your coffee or not?\\"    I wont say what i was thinking, but she did.. lol.  She said \\"Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!\\"    Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total,  have never charged to add milk.  In fact, she's such a regular that they usually start making her drink when she walks in.  Was it worth it Starbucks on 43rd??  Get a new manager who actually is nice to the customers.    Im done.

A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches., what would be the answer ?

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series.

Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member.

One day while chasing an errant tenant, he is run over by a bus and killed. He descends into hell (which resembles a corporate business) and meets the Devil's chief henchman Barney Satin (Bill Cosby). He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed to spend eternity at a section called Level 4. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people to sell their souls in exchange for his. Max returns to Earth and begins his frantic quest with two months (ending on May 15) to complete his mission. Barney appears frequently throughout the movie to check up on Max's progress as well as both taunt and persuade him to carry out the plans. A running joke is that nobody, except Max, can see or hear Barney.In addition to being temporarily alive, Max soon learns that he casts no reflection when he looks into any mirror.

Sunlight is a form of radiation that has two forms, ultraviolet a (uva) and ultraviolet b (uvb) radiation. Your main source of vitamin d occurs when uvb radiation strikes your skin. When this happens, the first steps of vitamin d synthesis in your body is triggered. Choose your answer from:  -In addition, the most powerful blue rays that cause vitamin d are found in the sun. Your uvb radiation travels through your entire body including your skin and gets to the spot where you are prone to sunburn.;  -Your skin reacts directly to uvb rays. You don't get the energy necessary to take any \\" sun-enhancing \\" steps yet.;  -After this, the next steps occur in the liver and then the kidneys. Because the rest takes place inside the body, once the body is triggered, you no longer need to be exposed to uvb radiation.;  -Ultraviolet a (uva) is the active radiation that is produced by the sun, but is not useful for biosynthesis. Instead, vitamin d is produced on the uva inner layer of your skin.; Answer:","output":"- After this, the next steps occur in the liver and then the kidneys. Because the rest takes place inside the body, once the body is triggered, you no longer need to be exposed to uvb radiation. Explanation: The correct answer is about the next steps in vitamin D synthesis after exposure to uvb radiation. The other options are incorrect because: 1. There aren't \\"powerful blue rays\\" mentioned in the context, and uvb radiation doesn't travel through the entire body. 2.

Which entity is this text about? Michael Craig Judge (born October 17, 1962) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician. Judge is the creator of the television series Beavis and Butt-Head (1993-97, 2011), and co-creator of the television series King of the Hill (1997-2010), The Goode Family (2009), Silicon Valley (2014-present), and Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus (2017). He also wrote and directed the films Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996), Office Space (1999), Idiocracy (2006) and Extract (2009). Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics. He graduated in 1986 from University of California, San Diego. In 1987, he moved to Silicon Valley to join Parallax Graphics, a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues (\\"The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was\\"), Judge quit after less than three months and became a bass player with a touring blues band.  He was a part of Anson Funderburgh's band for two years, playing on their 1990 Black Top Records release \\"Rack 'Em Up\\", while taking graduate math classes at the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased a Bolex 16 mm film camera and began creating his own animated shorts. In 1991, his short film \\"Office Space\\" (also known as the Milton series of shorts) was acquired by Comedy Central, following an animation festival in Dallas. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with Doyle Bramhall.  In 1992, he developed Frog Baseball, a short film featuring the characters Beavis and Butt-Head, to be featured on Liquid Television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on MTV. The short led to the creation of the Beavis and Butt-Head series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head (both voiced by Judge), who go to High School at Highland High in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the same city where Judge was raised and attended high school). The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, Beavis and Butt-Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.  Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two - Blood Drive/Give Blood and Door to Door - which he described as \\"awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand.\\" The series spawned the feature-length film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America and the spin-off show Daria.  After two decades, the series aired its new season on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. On January 10, 2014, Judge announced that there is still a chance to pitch Beavis and Butt-Head to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.","output":"This text is about Michael Craig Judge, also known as Mike Judge.

Does confidence mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, confidence has different meanings in these two sentences. Although both sentences use the word 'confidence,' each context reveals a distinct connotation and interpretation. In Sentence 1, confidence refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully accomplish a task or handle a situation. It can also be associated with one's self-assurance, self-esteem, or self-efficacy. The phrase \\"Confidence is always borrowed, never owned\\" emphasizes that a person's confidence may be affected by external factors, such as validation, support, or feedback from others. This suggests that confidence is something temporary or situational, rather than an inherent or permanent trait. It implies that individuals might need to continually work on maintaining, regaining, or building confidence based on their experiences and interactions with others. In Sentence 2, confidence takes on a different meaning, associated with trust, secrecy, and privacy. In this context, the word 'confidences' refers to the personal and private information that individuals share with one another based on a foundation of trust. When \\"everyone trusted him with their confidences,\\" it implies that the individual is deemed trustworthy and reliable, so people feel comfortable confiding their secrets, feelings, or sensitive information. This meaning of confidence is not related to the belief in one's ability or self-assurance, but rather focuses on the trustworthiness of the individual, who becomes the custodian of others' secrets. In summary, Sentence 1 uses 'confidence' to represent self-belief or self-assurance, while Sentence 2 employs the term to refer to the trust and private information people share with a trustworthy person. Although both sentences use the same word, they communicate different meanings based on their respective contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The rooms in the Cube are being monitored from a remote observation room by two technicians, Eric Wynn and Dodd, who are unaware of who their employers are. The pair are shown playing chess during work, whereupon Wynn demonstrates mental calculator abilities which he uses to predict Dodd's moves. Wynn has also a hobby of drawing comics that portray him and Dodd as superheroes. Wynn and Dodd are ordered to record the dream of a subject, Cassandra Rains. In her dream, Wynn sees Rains captured while walking in a forest with her daughter. Rains wakes up in the Cube and meets the other occupants: one of them, Robert Haskell, has the same tattoo on his forehead as the soldier who captured her.

Swirl the two together with a spoon until they’re fully mixed.  The antibacterial soap will kill any germs or bacteria on the brushes, while the olive oil will help break down stubborn makeup so the brushes rinse clean. Don’t use a paper plate for mixing the cleaner. The oil will seep through paper. Take the brushes that you plan to clean and run them under lukewarm water. Run your fingers over the bristles to ensure that they’re all completely wet. Be careful to hold the brushes with the bristles facing down when you wet them. If water gets inside the brushes’ ferrell, the part of the brushes just below the bristles that holds them to the handle, it may loosen the glue so bristles start falling out. Coat all of the brushes’ bristles with the soap mixture. Next, run the brushes back and forth over the palm of your hand to work the cleaner in. Keep moving the brushes over your hand until the suds are no longer colored with makeup. For extremely dirty makeup brushes, you may need to wipe off the suds and dip the brushes in the cleaner a second time. Once the soapy residue is no longer colored, run the brushes under lukewarm water until no suds come out of the bristles. Gently reshape the wet bristles with your fingers, and lay them flat to air dry. If possible, lay your brushes flat on the edge of a table or counter so the bristles hang over the edge. That will keep any moisture from seeping into the ferrule. Summary:","output":"To clean makeup brushes, mix 2 parts antibacterial dish soap and 1 part olive oil on a small, non-paper plate.

Context: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" Question: How does Obama feel about the museum?

Additionally, he mentions collaboration spaces for young people, artists, and directors to work on music and community storytelling, emphasizing his goal of fostering creativity and leadership skills.  His excitement doesn't stop at the project itself; Obama has shown a strong commitment to the community through a substantial financial contribution. Both he and Michelle Obama are donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program, demonstrating their dedication to improve the lives of the people in the area and make a lasting impact through their library and museum. Furthermore, Obama's unwavering belief that the library had to be located in the south side of Chicago speaks volumes about his emotional connection to the project and the community.

To do that, we'll add 1 to both sides.  So, when we add 1 to -4, we get -3.  Our equation now looks like: -3 = -s Now, we want to find out what 's' is. Since 's' is being multiplied by -1, we can simply multiply -3 by -1 to get the value of 's'. -3 multiplied by -1 is 3 (because when we multiply two negative numbers, we get a positive number).

No. Although the provided answer does contain some valuable information about Nanjing University Library, it does not directly and clearly answer the question, \\"What is the Nanjing Library's ranking in China?\\" A more detailed and long answer would be: Nanjing Library, also known as Nanjing University Library, ranks among the top university libraries in China. It is the second largest university library in the country, only surpassed by Peking University Library. The library's ranking is largely due to its vast and diverse collections, which consist of numerous valuable and rare items from both Chinese and world history. Established in 1902, Nanjing University Library has grown and expanded over the years, making significant contributions to academic research and education. As of now, the library has a total collection of more than six million volumes, including approximately 1.4 million digital resources. These resources cover a wide range of subjects, supporting research and learning across various disciplines. One of the key factors contributing to the high ranking of Nanjing University Library is its abundant collection of precious works. The library houses around 1.95 million ancient books, the most valuable of which are over 50,000 volumes of old thread-bound Chinese books. Furthermore, the library includes a number of rare manuscripts and inscribed stone tablets dating back as far as the Qin and Han Dynasties. Another aspect that highlights Nanjing University Library's prominence among Chinese libraries is the Modern Chinese Document Archives. These archives contain important historical documents, official records, and personal writings from the early 20th century to the present day, providing researchers a unique insight into contemporary Chinese history. In conclusion, although the Nanjing University Library is the second largest university library in China, it is the fifth largest nationwide. Its ranking can be attributed to the library's impressive collection, both in terms of size and value, as well as its dedication to preserving and providing access to precious works from Chinese and world history.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements.

The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Thing That Couldn't Die Movie plot: A young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), who claims to have psychic powers, lives on a remote ranch with her Aunt Flavia (Peggy Converse). She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster... My question: Why does Jessica  take off her cross? The answer to this question is:","output":"Jessica takes off her cross because her boyfriend, Gordon, removes it from her neck in order to make a cast of it. He does this with the intention of appraising its historical value, unknowingly leaving Jessica vulnerable to Gideon Drew's telepathic influence. This ironic turn of events occurs because while the guest under Gideon's control was unable to remove the protective cross, it is Jessica's trusted protector, her boyfriend, who inadvertently puts her in harm's way by removing it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does The Blair Witch Project ring a bell? Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","output":"The review can be considered as a mixture of both positive and negative sentiments. The positive aspects of the review are evident in phrases like \\"lots of fun\\" and the fact that the reviewer mentions laughter while watching the film. The reviewer's mention of The Blair Witch Project, a successful low-budget horror film, suggests that they acknowledge the potential for the filmmakers to achieve success in a similar manner. On the other hand, negative sentiments can be observed in the reviewer's mention of guilt and their emphasis on the term \\"painfully sincere guys.\\" This suggests that the reviewer finds the characters' authenticity somewhat uncomfortable to watch. Another negative aspect is the reference to the \\"questionable\\" route taken by Mark, implying disapproval or criticism of his choices in the movie. In conclusion, the review leans more towards the positive side, acknowledging the entertainment value provided by the film and its possible potential for success.

Muslim community leader Keysar Trad has accused the Federal Government of exaggerating the home-grown militants problem. There are reports that Islamic radicals have Australia in their sights and that counter-terror agencies are preparing to lift the country's alert status to high. But the president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia (IFAA) says the concerted 'negative campaigns' against the building of mosques is a major part of the problem which has 'radicalised some of our youth'. 'We want to be part of the solution but denying us the ability to build more prayer facilities, enabling us to reach out to those lost souls, is making it too easy for the radical minority to win,' Mr Trad said.

He urged the Federal Government and society as a whole to work together with the Muslim community instead of isolating them and relying on scaremongering tactics. \\"If the government is genuinely concerned about Australia's security, they need to invest in working collaboratively with the Muslim community and its leaders, listening to their experiences and insights, and tackling the root causes of radicalization,\\" Mr. Trad said. \\"Maintaining a rigid, adversarial approach will only push those we need to reach further away and provide fertile ground for extremists to exploit.\\" Many members of the Muslim community feel marginalized and believe that their voices are not being heard. There is a growing number of community leaders, like Mr. Trad, who are attempting to bridge the gap and encourage the government to cooperate with them in addressing the issue together. In response to the potential heightened alert status, Mr. Trad stated that while national security should be a priority, it should not come at the expense, or further alienation, of any group of citizens. He called on all Australians to unite against fear and to avoid targeting specific communities, which can lead to further radicalization. \\"Let us stand together as Australians, regardless of faith, ethnicity, or social background and work together to find the solutions we need,\\" the IFAA founder concluded. \\"Only through unity and understanding can we effectively counter the threat of extremism and create an inclusive, supportive society where all members feel valued and safe.\\" As the government reviews its counter-terrorism measures and debates regarding the construction of mosques continue, it is crucial that open dialogues and cooperation between the authorities and community leaders are maintained.

Answer:","output":"To determine how Robin would feel after watching the movie Titanic repeatedly, let's analyze the given options step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the context Robin has seen the movie Titanic multiple times at the theater. Step 2: Analyze Option I - Crushing on Leonardo DiCaprio This option assumes that Robin would develop a crush on the lead actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, after watching the movie several times. While this is a possibility, it doesn't specifically define how Robin feels as a result of seeing the movie. Step 3: Analyze Option II - a patron who likes Titanic This option represents someone who appreciates and enjoys the movie. Given that Robin has seen it multiple times in the theater, it would be reasonable to assume that they like Titanic. Step 4: Analyze Option III - Wishing for him This option is unclear and doesn't provide enough information about what Robin would be wishing for. It could be referring to wishing for Leonardo DiCaprio or something related to the storyline, but the context is not clear enough.

Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - The canton of Valais is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, situated in the southwestern part of the country, around the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps. The canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks found in Switzerland. The canton of Valais is widely known for the Matterhorn and resort towns such as Crans-Montana, Saas Fee and Zermatt. It is composed of 13 districts (hence the 13 stars on the flag) and its capital is Sion.  - Roman Agaunum, the modern Saint-Maurice in the canton Valais in southwesternmost Switzerland, was a minor post confined between the Rhône and the mountains along the well-travelled road that led from Roman Genava, modern Geneva, over the Alps by the Great St. Bernard Pass to Italy.  - Saluzzo is a town and former principality in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont region, Italy.  - Saint Chiaffredo ( Chiaffredus , Theofredus , Ciafrè , Chaffre , Teofredo , Jafredo , Jafredus , Eufredus , Jofredus , Sinfredus , Zaffredus ) is venerated as the patron saint of Saluzzo , Italy . Tradition considers him a member of the Theban Legion , but instead of being martyred with this legion at Agaunum ( in present - day Switzerland ) , he escaped to Piedmont and was martyred there . A 14th - century account relates that , around 522 , a man fell from a precipice near Crissolo but remained unharmed . The local population attributed his being unharmed to relics discovered by a peasant plowing in the vicinity - a discovery attributed to divine intervention . The mysterious skeleton was given the name of \`\` San Ciafrè '' and the tomb became the focus of a celebrated sanctuary at Crissolo . The first documentary evidence pointing to a cult devoted to Chiaffredo dates from 1387 , when Avignon Pope Clement VII granted indulgences to those who visited the church at Crissolo and helped in its repair . A late 16th century legend written down by Guglielmo Baldesano states that Chiaffredo or Teofredo , soldier of the Theban Legion , escaped to Piedmont to avoid sacrificing to pagan idols and was martyred at Crissolo around 270 .

Until the middle of the first century, 10 cohorts (about 5,000 men) made up a Roman Legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with 6 centuries at 80 men each) and one cohort, the first cohort, of double strength (5 double-strength centuries with 160 men each).  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - Turin ( pronounced ) is a city and an important business and cultural centre in northern Italy, capital of the Piedmont region and was the first capital city of Italy. The city is located mainly on the western bank of the Po River, in front of Susa Valley and surrounded by the western Alpine arch and by the Superga Hill. The population of the city proper is 892,649 (August 2015) while the population of the urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 1.7 million inhabitants. The Turin metropolitan area is estimated by the OECD to have a population of 2.2 million.  - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Cuneo (Italian) or Coni (French and Piedmontese) is a province in the southwest of the Piedmont region of Italy. To the west it borders on the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes). To the north it borders on the province of Turin. To the east it borders on the province of Asti. To the south it borders on the Ligurian provinces of Savona and Imperia. It is also known as the Provincia Granda, the big province, because it is the third largest province in Italy (following the provinces of South Tyrol and Foggia) and the largest one in Piedmont. Briga Marittima and Tenda were part of this province before cession to France in 1947.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Question: What do they call someone born of a parent who practiced witchcraft? Movie title: The Craft Movie plot: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\". To do so, she plans to \\"call the corners\\" by creating a fire on a beach, so that all four natural elements (earth, fire, air, and water) can be called upon by the four separate girls, to grant them further supernatural abilities. On completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning, and all four girls fall unconscious. Afterward Nancy is...

One of these is the classic ensemble of a white shirt and skirt, elegantly complemented by a vest, tie, robe, socks, and shoes. Though it may sound simple, putting together the perfect outfit requires careful consideration and an understanding of the various elements involved. In this article, we will walk you through a step-by-step process of putting together this charming, timeless look that transcends seasons and occasions. Step 1: Wear a white shirt: The cornerstone of this timeless ensemble is a clean, crisp white shirt. A white shirt is versatile and provides the perfect canvas to build your outfit around. Consider opting for a high-quality fabric to ensure comfort and longevity, such as Egyptian or sea island cotton. Additionally, choose a well-fitted shirt that accentuates your body's features without appearing too tight or baggy. Step 2: Find a skirt: Select a skirt that complements your white shirt. Skirts come in a variety of shapes, lengths, and materials, so make sure you pick one that suits your preferences and the occasion you plan to wear it for. A knee-length or slightly below the knee pencil skirt can be an excellent choice for a more formal setting, while a free-flowing midi-skirt can add a touch of elegance to your outfit if you prefer a more relaxed style. Look for skirts in neutral tones such as black, gray, or beige so that they can be easily coordinated with your remaining ensemble. Step 3: Choose a vest and tie: Accessorizing your outfit with a vest and tie adds a touch of sophistication and polish to your look. The vest should be tailored to fit comfortably over the white shirt and not overpower the rest of the outfit. When choosing the right tie, keep in mind that it should either match the dominant color of your skirt or provide a pleasing contrast. You may also opt for a timeless pattern like pinstripe, but be cautious not to choose a pattern that is too busy or overwhelming. Step 4: Select socks and shoes: Your choice of footwear should keep both comfort and style in mind. Depending on the formality of the event, you may choose to wear pumps or high heels, flats, or even a more casual pair of loafers. Neutral colors or shades that complement your outfit would be ideal. As for socks, opt for styles that either match your shoes or provide a subtle contrast. Consider materials like fine wool or cashmere for extra comfort and a touch of luxury. Step 5: Wear a robe: Draping a robe over your ensemble brings an extra layer of refinement and elegance to your outfit. Choose a breathable fabric with a graceful drape, such as silk or satin. The color of your robe should either harmonize with or accentuate the other elements of your ensemble. For an added touch of sophistication, consider wearing a robe with subtle embroidery or a minimalistic pattern. Conclusion: Assembling a classy ensemble that includes a white shirt, skirt, vest, tie, robe, socks, and shoes may be a simple process, but it requires a keen attention to detail and an understanding of style. By following this step-by-step guide, you can create a timeless look that is both fashionable and sophisticated, effortlessly taking you from the boardroom to a gala or from a day at the office to an evening out on the town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Today, we are going to learn how to make a delicious and warm ginger-cinnamon drink. This drink is perfect for a cold day or when you're feeling a little under the weather.  First, let's talk about the two main ingredients: ginger and cinnamon. Ginger is a root that looks a bit like a funky, twisted hand. It has a spicy and zingy taste. Cinnamon comes from the bark of a tree that's been dried and curled into sticks. It smells and tastes sweet and warm. Now, let's make our ginger-cinnamon drink! Step 1: Prepare the ingredients We are going to start by getting our ginger and cinnamon ready to use. First, we need to coarsely grate the ginger. This means we take a piece of ginger and rub it against a grater with big holes to make small, chunky pieces. Be careful not to hurt your fingers! Next, we're going to lightly crush the cinnamon stick. Crushing the cinnamon will help our drink get more flavor. You can ask a grown-up to help you with this. They can put the cinnamon in a plastic bag and gently hit it with a rolling pin or the bottom of a cup. Step 2: Simmer the ingredients Now that our ginger and cinnamon are prepared, we need to cook them. We'll put both the ginger and cinnamon in a pot with some water or another liquid like apple juice. Then, we're going to turn the stove's burner to medium heat. This helps the water become hot, but not too hot. We will let our drink simmer, which means it will cook slowly with little bubbles in the water. We'll do this for about 20 minutes. This will help the ginger and cinnamon release their yummy flavors into the water and make our drink taste amazing! Step 3: Enjoy your drink After 20 minutes, our ginger-cinnamon drink should be ready. We need to be very careful because the liquid will be hot. With the help of an adult, you can strain the drink, which means you will pour it through a small strainer to remove the pieces of ginger and cinnamon.  Now you can pour the ginger-cinnamon drink into a cup and let it cool down for a little bit. When it's not too hot, it's time to enjoy your delicious and warming drink! And there you have it, little friends! We made a yummy ginger-cinnamon drink together. This tasty drink is sure to make you feel cozy and warm. Now you know how to make this drink anytime you want, and you can even share it with your family and friends!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a huge WWII buff, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR.

The excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China (and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It begs the question: If I disliked it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all. I'd be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"I would say this review is negative. The reviewer mentions several criticisms, such as the slow pace, impersonal filming style, and lack of engagement with the characters. Additionally, they express disappointment when comparing this film to the works of other Chinese directors and wouldn't want Chinese cinema to be judged by this film's standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots in late 1323, peasant insurrection escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The uprising in Flanders was caused by both excessive taxations levied by the Count of Flanders Louis I, and by his pro-French policies. The insurrection had urban leaders and rural factions which took over most of Flanders by 1325. The revolt was led by Nicolaas Zannekin, a rich farmer from Lampernisse. Zannekin and his men captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ypres and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture the count himself. In 1325, attempts to capture Gent and Oudenaarde failed. The King of France, Charles IV intervened, whereupon Louis was released from captivity in February 1326 and the Peace of Arques was sealed. The peace soon failed, and the count fled to France when more hostilities erupted. Louis convinced his new liege Philip VI of France to come to his aid, and Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel. Answer this question: What happened first, the attempt to capture Gent and Oudenaarde or the Peasant revolt in Flanders?","output":"The Peasant revolt in Flanders happened first. The revolt began as a series of scattered rural riots in late 1323 and escalated into a full-scale rebellion. The attempts to capture Gent and Oudenaarde occurred later, in 1325, as part of the ongoing insurrection."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What did Chartwell have extensive views of?  Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Storm) is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny & Associates talent agency. The members are Ohno Satoshi, Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999.

Context: Johnny & Associates announced the group's debut on September 15, 1999 through a press conference aboard a cruise ship off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii. Then-president Johnny Kitagawa chose five trainees from the Johnny's Jr. division of the agency to become the members of Arashi, the Japanese word for Storm, and to represent the agency's thrust of \\"creating a storm throughout the world\\". On November 3, 1999, they made their CD debut by releasing the single \\"Arashi\\", which became the theme song for the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup hosted by Japan in 1999. It went on to become a major hit, selling 557,430 copies in its first week and almost a million copies by the end of its chart run.  On April 5, 2000, Arashi released their second single, \\"Sunrise Nippon/Horizon\\", which debuted at number-one on the Oricon weekly singles chart selling 304,340 copies. The next day, the group began their first concert tour at Osaka Hall. In July, the group released their next single \\"Typhoon Generation\\", which debuted at number three on the weekly singles chart with 256,510 copies sold, and continued to chart for nine weeks before leaving the charts. After holding more concerts in August, the group released their last single of 2000, \\"Kansha Kangeki Ame Arashi\\". The single debuted at number two on the Oricon weekly singles chart and had first-week sales of 258,720.  In January 2001, Arashi released their first studio album, Arashi No.1 Ichigou: Arashi wa Arashi o Yobu!. The album debuted at number-one on the Oricon weekly album chart with initial sales of 267,220 copies. Until the release of their tenth anniversary compilation album All the Best! 1999-2009, the album remained the group's best-selling album with overall sales of about 323,030 for nearly ten years. From March 25 to April 30, 2001, the group embarked on their first nationwide concert tour Arashi Spring Concert 2001. The tour took place in Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, Hokkaido, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Kanazawa, Toyama, and Tokyo with an unprecedented twenty-six performances. Before moving to a private record label by the end of 2001, Arashi released \\"Jidai\\" as their final single under Pony Canyon. Used as the theme song for Matsumoto's drama Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo 3, it was named Best Theme Song in the 30th Television Drama Academy Awards. Question: Did that single perform well?.

Question: Little sarah didn't think that anyone should be kissing boys.  She thought that boys had what? Options: - arousal - disease - sweet - halatosis - cooties  Explain why a human would choose \\"cooties\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Cooties\\" The choice of \\"cooties\\" as the answer to this question stems from a culturally ingrained notion that has often been used by children to express their initial aversion to the opposite gender. To understand why a human would choose \\"cooties\\" over the other options, it is essential to explore the concept of cooties, its cultural significance, and its connection to the mindset of a young child like Little Sarah. Cooties are an imaginary, fictional germ that children believe they can catch from members of the opposite sex. The idea of cooties has been prevalent in many cultures, particularly in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The origin of the term \\"cooties\\" can be traced back to World War I, where it was used to describe lice that infested soldiers in the trenches. Over time, this term has evolved and become popular among children. As children grow up and begin to notice the differences between boys and girls, they might feel shy, awkward, or confused about interacting with the opposite gender. This is especially true during the early stages of adolescence when they start to develop opinions on romantic relationships. To cope with this uncertainty, children create a playful narrative of contagion, in which they may attribute catching cooties to touching or being in close proximity with members of the opposite sex. In the context of Little Sarah's thoughts on kissing boys, her belief that boys have cooties reflects her innocence and her lack of understanding of the complexities of relationships. Choosing \\"cooties\\" instead of the other available options highlights her age-appropriate concerns and coping mechanisms. Furthermore, Little Sarah's mindset is consistent with many children her age who are trying to navigate their social environment and understand boundaries between genders. The other options provided - arousal, disease, sweet, and halatosis - may not resonate with her age group and cognitive development stage. Arousal and halatosis are complex terminologies that a young child might not comprehend. Disease might seem far-fetched for her to connect with kissing boys, and sweet might not capture her aversion toward kissing. Therefore, a human would choose \\"cooties\\" to answer the question because it best captures the essence of Little Sarah's thoughts on kissing boys and accurately reflects a common mindset among children her age. The term \\"cooties\\" effectively encompasses her innocence, her attempts to navigate relationships at a young age, and her playful approach to understanding the opposite gender."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I had heard mixed reviews prior to my visit, but I wanted to give it a chance since it's close to my workplace. Unfortunately, my experience can only be described as disappointing, with sub-par food and inattentive service as the main culprits. Upon entering, I was greeted by a host who showed me to my table. The ambiance was decent, and the restaurant was clean, but the mood quickly shifted when it took nearly 15 minutes for the server to approach our table and take our orders. I understand that restaurants can be busy, but it wasn't too crowded during our visit, and there seemed to be plenty of staff members working. We decided to start with the artichoke dip as an appetizer. Unfortunately, the dip had a strange aftertaste and was lukewarm when it arrived at our table, leading me to think it wasn't freshly made. To top it off, the portion size was quite small, despite the dish being sold as a sharing platter. For my entree, I ordered the pan-seared salmon with a side of veggies and steamed rice. While the salmon was cooked well on the outside, it was borderline raw in the center, and the presentation was far from decent. Furthermore, the side of veggies was visibly overcooked and tasted bland, adding to the overall lackluster nature of the dish. My dining partner went for the steak, which they requested medium-rare but received well-done. It was accompanied by mashed potatoes that were mediocre at best and seemed as though they came from a box. Though the steak was of decent quality, it was evident that the dish did not receive the attention required to ensure an enjoyable dining experience. Moreover, throughout our meal, our server seemed preoccupied and rarely checked in to see if we needed anything or to inquire about our thoughts on the dishes. We had to flag down another server to request drink refills and condiments. It definitely made us feel as though our business wasn't valued. Even though I wanted to provide The Bistro Hub with the benefit of the doubt, the combination of mediocre food and subpar service made it impossible for me to justify returning to the establishment. Disappointment would be an understatement, and I feel compelled to share my experience. Hopefully, management takes note and works on improving their offerings, but until then, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone in the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Sent 2: Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. Sent 3: We might call it the first Chinese invention. Sent 4: Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Sent 5: Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. Sent 6: He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Sent 7: Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. Sent 8: And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Sent 9: Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. Sent 10: The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Sent 11: Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. Sent 12: The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. Sent 13: This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. Sent 14: And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. Sent 15: During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Sent 16: Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. Sent 17: And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. Sent 18: The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: Peking Man achieved a mastery of fire in what is currently which nation?. Output:","output":"Part #1: Understand the main focus of the question. Usage: The question asks about the current nation where Peking Man achieved a mastery of fire. This helps to identify which sentence in the paragraph contains the relevant information. Part #2: Identify the sentence containing the information about Peking Man and his mastery of fire. Usage: \\"Sent 2: Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.\\" This sentence mentions Peking Man's mastery of fire and is the starting point to find the nation's information.

Summarize this article: Cut a skinny strip out of white crepe paper or tissue paper. Fold it in half several times, then cut a long, skinny petal shape out of it. This should give you several petals. Repeat this step until you have about 20 to 24 petals. Have the petals taper into a skinny tab at the bottom so that you can secure them more easily. If you used crepe paper, you can gently pull the petals apart at the center to widen them. If you used tissue paper, you can fold the petals over a toothpick or skewer lengthwise to create a slight crease. Make the petals more realistic by cutting a notch into the tip Begin by cutting a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) tall rectangle from green tissue paper or crepe paper. Next, cut a jagged, grass-like fringe into one of the long edges. This will make the base of the daisy and help cover up the bottom part of the petals. Plan on making the rectangle about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long. You can always trim it down later if it's too long. Begin by folding a piece of green tissue or crepe paper in half. Cut a half-oval out of it, then cut notches into the curved edge of the oval. Unfold the oval to reveal your leaf. You can make as many leaves as you want. 2 to 3 would be ideal, however. Summary:","output":"The article provides instructions on making a paper daisy. First, create 20 to 24 skinny petals by cutting and folding white crepe or tissue paper.

Translate to Russian","output":"Баланс также может содержать статьи активов, чья фактическая стоимость отличается от указанной. Балансовый отчет является одним из основных финансовых документов, который отражает финансовое состояние компании или организации на определенную дату. Он состоит из двух частей: активов и пассивов. Активы включают все ресурсы, которыми обладает компания, а пассивы представляют собой обязательства перед внешними сторонами. Важно отметить, что активы и пассивы всегда должны соответствовать друг другу, то есть быть уравновешенными. Однако бывают случаи, когда активы балансового отчета могут содержать статьи, чья фактическая стоимость отличается от указанной. Это может произойти по ряду причин, таких как ошибки, изменение стоимости активов из-за инфляции, устаревание оборудования, снижение стоимости акций и многое другое. В таких случаях компания должна провести переоценку активов, чтобы определить их реальную стоимость и, при необходимости, скорректировать балансовый отчет. Переоценка активов обычно проводится специалистами-оценщиками, которые, опираясь на различные методы оценки, выявляют текущую стоимость активов и сравнивают ее с указанной в балансе. Если обнаружены значительные отклонения, компания должна отразить этот факт в своем финансовом отчете. Иногда компании могут намеренно искажать реальную стоимость активов, чтобы улучшить свою финансовую картику или уклониться от налогов. В таких ситуациях роли контрольных органов, таких как налоговые инспекции и аудиторы, становятся еще более значимыми, так как они несут ответственность за проверку и контроль правильности составления и представления финансовой отчетности. В целом, искажение стоимости активов в балансовом отчете может иметь серьезные последствия как для компании, так и для сторонних инвесторов и кредиторов, которые опираются на эту информацию при принятии решений о сотрудничестве или инвестициях. Поэтому адекватное отражение реальной стоимости активов и своевременное проведение переоценки являются критически важными для поддержания точности и достоверности финансовых данных."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A prologue or prolog ( Greek  prólogos , from pro , \`\` before '' and lógos , \`\` word '' ) is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details , often some earlier story that ties into the main one , and other miscellaneous information . The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo .  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work.  - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.    What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'prologue'?

First, let's combine the t terms on the right side of the equation. So we get: 33*t - 84 = (-3 - 6)*t => 33*t - 84 = -9*t Now let's move the -9*t from the right side to the left side by adding 9*t to both sides. This way, we can get all the t terms together: 33*t + 9*t - 84 = 0 => 42*t - 84 = 0 Now we want to get t by itself, so let's move the -84 to the right side by adding 84 to both sides: 42*t = 84 Now we want to find out how many times 42 must be multiplied to get 84. So we'll divide both sides by 42: t = 84 ÷ 42 When you divide, you find that t equals 2: t = 2 So the solution for t in the equation is t = 2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie.

This is because there is a bumpier surface in the (A) garage floor (B) gravel parking lot.  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"garage floor\\" and  \\"gravel parking lot\\". A:","output":"The car moves more smoothly into the garage than the parking lot because there is a bumpier surface in the \\"gravel parking lot.\\" When a car drives on a gravel parking lot, the rough and irregular surface of the gravel contributes to a bumpier and less even ride. The gravel is made up of uneven stones and rocks, which can interfere with the smoothness of the car's movement as the tires have to traverse the inconsistent terrain. This can result in a rougher driving experience and requires the vehicle's suspension system to work harder in order to maintain the car's stability. On the other hand, the garage floor is typically made of a smoother and more even material, such as concrete. This surface is free from the inconsistencies and irregularities of a gravel parking lot. As a result, the car can move more smoothly and effortlessly when it transitions from the bumpy gravel parking lot to the more uniform garage floor.  The smoothness of the garage floor not only provides a more comfortable driving experience but also minimizes any potential damage to the vehicle caused by continuous exposure to uneven surfaces, such as straining the suspension system or causing premature wear on the tires. For these reasons, it is clear that the bumpier surface resides in the gravel parking lot, and the garage floor offers a smoother and more level driving experience."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The town is an important tourist destination known as Zell am See-Kaprun and is a transportation hub for the region.  - A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski.  - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A piste is a marked ski run or path down a mountain for snow skiing, snowboarding, or other mountain sports.  - The Ski Amadé region of Austria is a network of 28 ski areas and towns that combined, make up the second largest ski area in Europe.

Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area  a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.  - International Ski Federation (FIS; short for Fédération Internationale de Ski) is the world's highest governing body for international winter sports. Founded in 1924, it is responsible for the Olympic disciplines of Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The FIS is also responsible for setting the international competition rules. The organization now has a membership of 118 national ski associations and is based in Oberhofen am Thunersee, Switzerland.  - An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities for passengers travelling between countries. International airports are typically larger than domestic airports and often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel. International airports often also host domestic flights. Some, such as Frankfurt Airport in Germany are very large; others such as Fa'a' International Airport in Tahiti, are quite small.  - Salzburg (literally: \\"Salt Fortress\\") is the fourth-largest city in Austria and the capital of the federal state of Salzburg.  - Saalbach - Hinterglemm is a municipality in the district of Zell am See ( Pinzgau region ) , in the Austrian state of Salzburg .

Q: What do opposite charges do to one another?   Choices:  - strengthen  - weaken  - repel  - attract  A:","output":"The answer is 'attract'. In the context of electric charges, as per the provided paragraph, opposite charges attract one another. This is a fundamental principle of electrostatics, often summarized as \\"opposites attract, likes repel.\\" So, when you have two charges that are opposite, meaning one is positively charged and the other is negatively charged, they will be attracted to each other. This attraction is due to the electric force between them which pulls them together. The greater the charges and the closer they are to each other, the stronger this force of attraction will be. Therefore, given the choices - strengthen, weaken, repel, and attract, the correct answer to the question of what do opposite charges do to one another would be they 'attract'.

Semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction. When a voltage is applied in that direction, current flows only when ionization is produced by radiation, similar to what happens in a Geiger tube. Further, the amount of current in a solid-state detector is closely related to the energy deposited and, since the detector is solid, it can have a high efficiency (since ionizing radiation is stopped in a shorter distance in solids fewer particles escape detection). As with scintillators, very sophisticated information can be obtained from solid-state detectors.

Given the question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible.  Question: suppose the bones are put underground more quickly happens, how will it affect animals eat more of the bones.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: less If the bones are buried more quickly, it will have an effect on the number of bones available for animals to consume. When bones are put underground faster, they are not exposed and accessible to scavengers for as long of a time period. As a result, fewer animals will have the opportunity to find and consume the bones. When an organism dies, scavengers, such as vultures, hyenas, and insects, play a crucial role in breaking down the body and consuming the soft tissue. The bones might take longer to break down, giving scavengers the chance to consume or gather them when they're still on the surface. If the bones are buried more quickly, scavengers will have a reduced chance of finding the bones and will consequently eat less of them overall. In addition to making the bones less available for consumption, the faster burial can also preserve more of the bones from being eaten. The faster burial can protect the bones from being scattered or damaged by scavengers that could have otherwise further broken them apart or carried them off, which would impact the chances of fossilization. However, it is important to note that while faster burial may affect the amount of bones consumed by scavengers, the overall impact on the scavengers might not be significant. Scavengers are opportunistic feeders, meaning they consume a variety of food sources, and bones are just one of many. The reduced availability of bones due to faster burial would likely have a minimal effect on the overall diet and behavior of these scavengers. In conclusion, if the bones are buried underground more quickly, it will cause a decrease in the number of bones consumed by animals, as the bones will be less available and accessible for scavengers to find and eat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dion Dublin (born 22 April 1969) is an English former footballer and television presenter. Born in Leicester and of Nigerian descent, he was capped four times for England. Dublin started his career as a centre-back with Norwich City, but made his name at Cambridge United as a centre-forward. He had spells with Norwich City, Cambridge United, Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic. On 20 September 2006, Norwich City announced that Dublin had joined them until the end of the 2006-07 season. It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3-3 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 14 October 2006 at Loftus Road. Steve Wilson cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind Norwich's 4-1 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates.  Dublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007-08 season. On 2 September 2007, Dublin, whilst a pundit on the Aston Villa v Chelsea game, said that this season would be his last as a footballer, citing the fact that his 'bones have started to talk to him' as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season.  During Spring 2008, Dublin was approached by Jimmy Quinn, then manager of Cambridge United, about joining his old club for the 2008-09 season. However, the player would not change his mind about retiring. He was voted the club's Player of the Year and awarded the Barry Butler trophy on 26 April 2008 in his final season as a footballer, at his penultimate game, and on his final appearance at Carrow Road. Dublin played his final game on 4 May 2008, featuring in Norwich's 4-1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in front of 36,208 fans at Hillsborough - the highest Championship attendance that season. When he was taken off in the 66th minute, Dublin received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters, players and referee Mark Clattenburg.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In an animated sequence, a plane flying through the fictional Bukuvu region in the heart of Africa crashes. A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees, has grown to be King of the Jungle. Ursula Stanhope, a San Francisco heiress, tours Uganda with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters. Ursula is tracked down and joined by her fiancé, Lyle Van De Groot, with two poachers named Max and Thor. Kwame tells the group of the \\"White Ape\\", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the jungle. The next day Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee while Ursula is saved by George. George takes Ursula to his treehouse home and cares for her, introducing her to Shep, an African bush elephant that acts like George's dog, and Tookie, a toco toucan. George is smitten with Ursula and attempts to woo her; Ursula reciprocates his attraction, and her time spent with George makes her no longer wish to return home. Lyle, Max and Thor find the treehouse and Lyle confronts Ursula and George. Max and Thor make to shoot Shep for his ivory, and Ape shouts at Shep to run. Everyone is stunned by the sight of a talking ape and Max and Thor decide to tranquilize and capture him. George runs to stop them and is accidentally shot by Lyle, who thought his gun was a novelty lighter. Lyle and the poachers are imprisoned and Lyle is identified as the shooter by the porters; Max and Thor are released and resolve to capture Ape to make a fortune in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Ursula takes George home to get medical help for his wound and to see the human world he belongs in. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who confronts George and Ursula is Van De Groot. Lyle Van De Groot is Ursula's fiancé who joins her in the jungle expedition with the intention of taking her back home. He eventually finds Ursula and George at the treehouse, which leads to the confrontation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"William III of England, also known as William of Orange, was born on November 4, 1650, in the Binnenhof, The Hague, Netherlands. A key figure in the Protestant Reformation, he followed the Calvinist religion.  William III ascended to the throne as the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland on February 13, 1689, following the Glorious Revolution, which saw the overthrow of King James II (his father-in-law and uncle), known for his Catholic ideology. William's reign marked a significant turning point in British history, as it limited the power of the monarchy in favor of a parliamentary system, affirming the principle of the constitutional monarchy. During his reign, William III fought against Louis XIV of France, forging a series of alliances with other European countries in an effort to maintain a balance of power and curb French expansion. He achieved this through multiple conflicts, such as the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714). Despite facing several challenges, including Jacobite rebellions and conflicts with Parliament, William III made notable contributions to British politics. He played a pivotal role in establishing the Bank of England, reforming the nation's finance system, and passing multiple Acts of Parliament that enshrined civil liberties and religious toleration. William III's portrait was immortalized by the celebrated painter Sir Godfrey Kneller. The famous signature \\"WilliamIII Sig.svg\\" is attributed to the monarch as well. On March 8, 1702, William III died at Kensington Palace in London. His death marked the end of his reign and, since he had no direct heir, led to the ascension of his sister-in-law, Queen Anne, to the throne. William III's legacy remains prominent in British history, as he played an instrumental role in shaping the modern concept of constitutional monarchy and ensuring the continued dominance of Protestantism in England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The simplest way to do this is to insert two fingers into the shackle loop and use them to force the shackle away from the top of the lock. This will put the locking pins inside the lock into the right position for a quick crack-job.  Make sure you’ve eliminated all excess slack from the shackle. If you don’t, you won’t be able to knock the lock loose, no matter how many times you hit it. Don’t try to grip the body of the lock itself—that’s where you’ll be aiming your hammer. More specifically, you want to target the side that contains the fixed end of the shackle, as the pins are located just underneath. Pound the lock over and over again using quick, short strikes. Eventually, you’ll disengage enough of the pins to “bump” the lock open. You can also use the handle of a screwdriver or another hard, blunt item if you don’t happen to have a hammer handy. The best part about coaxing a padlock open with a hammer is that it should still work like nothing ever happened afterwards, so long as you don’t hit it hard enough to damage any of the pins. As soon as you get done breaking your lock, give it a test run. If it fastens properly, hold onto it for future usage. If not, chuck it in the trash. This method can be useful if you need to remove your padlock without the keys but don’t want to destroy it in the process.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What authority did Neilston remain under until 1975? ?  Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the unitary East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority. Neilston remains part of Renfrewshire for purposes of registration and Lieutenancy. Neilston forms part of...

Ukraine ceasefire extended for 3 days Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has extended a ceasefire with insurgents in the nation's east for three days. Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavron had earlier said it was hoping for an extension of the truce, but warned that Ukraine must not simply delay an \\"ultimatum\\" for separatists to lay down their arms. \\"We hope that this does not only mean a postponement of the ultimatum for three days,\\" Lavrov was quoted by Interfax news agency as telling reporters in Moscow after Itar-Tass news agency reported that Kyiv had decided to extend the ceasefire. In an interview with the Guardian and four other European newspapers, Poroshenko said Ukrainian soldiers have been targeted in more than 150 attacks since the ceasefire began and that five soldiers have been killed on Friday alone. Poroshenko said Russia has done \\"nothing\\" to end the \\"distastrous\\" war. On Thursday, he said he might not extend the truce if it appeared that rebel groups were using the break in fighting to rearm. When he announced the ceasefire on June 20, he offered rebels amnesty if they lay down their weapons. Pro-Russian separatist leaders and mediators for the Kyiv government met in the city of Donetsk on Friday in new consultations on ending the fighting in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, a spokeswoman for the rebels said. Interfax news agency said the rebels were talking to the so-called \\"contact group\\" which includes former President Leonid Kuchma, Moscow's ambassador to Kyiv and representatives of the OSCE rights and security watchdog. A first round of talks was held last Monday and ended with a rebel commitment to honour the ceasefire. But the Kyiv government says the rebels have carried out numerous breaches of the ceasefire over the past week, including the downing of a military helicopter on Tuesday killing nine service personnel. In a separate development, Poroshenko on Friday signed a trade and economic pact with the European Union, saying it may be the \\"most important day\\" for his country since it became independent from the Soviet Union. It was the decision of his pro-Moscow predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, to back out of the same EU association agreement in November that touched off massive protests in Ukraine that eventually led to Yanukovych's flight abroad, Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists remain heavily armed in Ukraine's Donetsk region. (Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters) Later Friday, EU heads of state and government were expected to consider whether to ramp up sanctions against Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine. Before the signing ceremony, Poroshenko brandished a commemorative pen inscribed with the date of EU's Vilnius summit where Yanukovych balked at approving the agreement. \\"Historic events are unavoidable,\\" he said. At Friday's proceedings, the European Union signed similar association agreements with two other former Soviet republics, Moldova and Georgia. Businesses in the three countries whose goods and practices meet EU standards will be able to trade freely in any of the EU's 28 member nations without tariffs or restrictions. Likewise, EU goods and services will be able to sell more easily and cheaply to businesses and consumers in Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. \\"It's absolutely a new perspective for my country,\\" Poroshenko said. \\"There is nothing in these agreements or in the European Union's approach that might harm Russia in any way,\\" insisted EU President Herman Van Rompuy. But almost immediately, Moscow made clear it was reserving the right to react. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, told Russian news agencies that the Kremlin would respond to the EU-Ukraine accord \\"as soon as negative consequences arise for the economy.\\" But Peskov dismissed the threat of immediate action against Poroshenko's government. \\"In order for those (consequences) to arise, the signed agreement needs to be implemented,\\" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously imposed trade embargoes against its neighbours in response to political or economic moves that the Kremlin views as unfavourable. (Bernadett Szabo/Reuters) Russia has previously imposed trade embargoes against its neighbours in response to political or economic moves that the Kremlin views as unfavourable. European Commission experts estimate implementation of the deal is expected to boost Ukraine's national income by around 1.6 billion US a year. EU Enlargement Commission Stefan Fule said the trade bloc has made clear to Moscow its willingness to demonstrate that Russian economic interests will not be harmed. Perhaps more important than the trade clauses is an accompanying 10-year plan for Ukraine to adopt EU product regulations. Such rules ease the way for international trade beyond Europe. The deal also demands that Ukraine change the way it does business. Adopting EU rules on government contracts, competition policy and the copyright for ideas and inventions should improve the economy by making it more investor-friendly and reducing corruption. Reminding EU leaders of the Ukrainians who died opposing Yanukovych's government and in the ongoing battle against the pro-Russian insurgency in the country's east, Poroshenko said Ukraine \\"paid the highest possible price to make her Europe dreams come true.\\" He asked EU leaders to take a further step, and formally pledge that one day Ukraine will be able to join the EU as a full-fledged member. That \\"would cost the European Union nothing, but would mean the world to my country,\\" he said. Meanwhile, Putin called Friday for a long-term ceasefire in Ukraine to allow talks between representatives of Kyiv and eastern regions where rebels are waging an armed insurgency. Poroshenko has warned a ceasefire now in place may not be extended beyond Friday night when it is due to expire if peace talks with pro-Russian separatists fail to yield a favourable outcome. \\"Most important is the securing of a long-term ceasefire as a necessary condition for substantive talks between the authorities in Kyiv and representatives of the southeastern regions,\\" Putin said. \\"We sincerely strive to help the peace process,\\" he told delegates at a diplomatic ceremony in the Kremlin. Western governments have piled pressure on Putin to take steps to disarm the rebels who Kyiv accuses of numerous breaches of the truce aimed at giving the two sides time to find a political solution to the crisis. Putin also said that the violence in Ukraine had forced tens of thousands of Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, including in Russia.

Ford anticipates demand for 3-cylinder cars Ford Fiesta, left, with the Ford Focus 1.0-liter EcoBoost model. (Ford) The Ford Focus 1.0-liter EcoBoost sets records over two days at CERAM test circuit in France. (Ford) Dan Carney of Motor Matters discusses Ford’s 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine: Government fuel economy requirements are driving renewed consideration of three-cylinder engines by carmakers. Improved technology will make them more acceptable to consumers. We’ve seen relatively few cars with three-cylinder engines. The 1990 Suzuki Swift 1.0-liter 49-horsepower minicar was one. Based on current EPA fuel economy standards, the Swift would be rated today at 38 miles per gallon in the city and 45 mpg on the highway. The 1988 Subaru Justy with its 66-horsepower, 1.2-liter engine was another three-cylinder engine. The all-wheel-drive model would score 26 mpg city and 32 mpg highway today. There wasn’t much other than fuel economy to recommend these cars. They were cramped, slow, noisy, rough-riding and incredibly unsafe in a crash. To succeed, such cars must offer competitive power and performance in a package meeting modern expectations for safety and comfort. Safety and comfort add weight, which dings both fuel efficiency and performance. Efficiency and performance can normally be traded one for the other so it’s tough to have both, yet customers demand performance. Turbocharging is increasingly a part of the answer — and it is the foundation of Ford’s EcoBoost technology. We’ve seen convincing demonstrations of the muscle and economy of EcoBoost in brawny vehicles like the F-150 and Explorer, so we know that smaller-displacement engines can replace bigger ones while delivering fuel economy. So when Ford introduced the tiny 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine, I was hopeful that it might actually deliver acceptable performance to go with its superlative efficiency. To underscore this point, Ford attempted to establish new world speed records for the 1.0-liter engine category, with a record run at the CERAM test track north of Paris. The test car was a 125-horsepower Focus EcoBoost 1.0, a configuration already for sale in Europe. Here in the U.S., the smaller Fiesta is a good bet to be the first American model to carry the little EcoBoost engine. By setting the record with the bigger, heavier, roomier and more comfortable Focus rather than the Fiesta, Ford underscored the point that the three-cylinder engine can propel a larger, more comfortable car at record speed. While turbocharging is increasingly common and most drivers are getting comfortable with the idea that using speeding exhaust gas to spin a turbine that compresses air coming into the engine, Ford decided the test would not only be one of speed, but also one of endurance. Ford aimed to set speed records — and they invited me to help with the driving. On May 23 and 24, the gathered group of automotive journalists and Ford employees hammered Focus EcoBoost 1.0-liter test cars around the high-banked CERAM oval for 24 straight hours. In the end the Ford team tentatively set 24 new world speed records (pending official certification). Drivers saw lap speeds as high as 122 mph, the cars averaged 119 mph around the oval for an hour and the average speed for the full 24 hours, including pit stops for driver changes and refueling was 107 mph. This from a car that is rated at 56 mpg in Europe. Once it was clear the cars were taking the pounding just fine, we got the green light to drive flat-out for the last three hours of the run. Gas pedal on the floor, leg cramping to hold it down, for 60 straight minutes each, for three consecutive drivers. For the amazing test cars, it was no fuss, no muss, with no smoke, smells or other typical signs of strain. The temperature gauge never reached the halfway mark. There was a time when turbos were respected for their performance boost, but suspected for their reliability compromises. No more. Modern computer-aided engineering helps prevent hardware inadequacies. Modern computers keep an eye on the software side, ensure the engine never gets outside acceptable conditions, and modern ideas of durability demand extras like a supplemental water cooler for the turbo bearing to ensure it never gets too hot. Now the turbo is just another engine part, rather than a temperamental add-on. This test is the latest confirmation of that. If we didn’t break these cars, nothing will. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Ford's 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine and how it demonstrates improved technology in three-cylinder engines due to government fuel economy requirements. The author discusses the past limitations of three-cylinder engines and how Ford's EcoBoost technology has provided better performance and efficiency in vehicles.

Help as much as you can. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. This task involves annotating the answer type to a given question that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). Note that the questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. There are 3 possible answer types (i) spans, (ii) numbers and (iii) dates. If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \\"span\\". If the answer is a number, label as \\"number\\". Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Passage: After the defeat at Marignano, the League no longer possessed the ability or the will to continue the war. Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara. In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war. Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy , effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521-26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption. Question: What year was Sforza removed from the throne?

In the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing Niccolò Machiavelli and his friend Francesco Guicciardini initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the \\"effectual truth\\" instead. Their contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) said, \\"If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings.\\" Who did Machiavelli disdain?","output":"Machiavelli disdained writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals, instead of focusing on the \\"effectual truth.\\" He believed that it was essential to study and understand the practical realities and aspects of politics for better knowledge acquisition, instead of relying solely on theoretical or idealistic principles."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],j={key:0},N={key:1};function z(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
