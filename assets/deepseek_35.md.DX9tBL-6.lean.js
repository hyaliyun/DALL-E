The military called it its final \\"tactical road march.\\" A series of 110 heavily armored, hulking trucks and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles carrying about 500 soldiers streamed slowly but steadily out of the combat zone. A few minutes before 8 a.m., the metal gate behind the last MRAP closed. With it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years, its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions. The quiet American exit, shrouded in secrecy until it occurred, closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than 800 billion. The decision to invade Iraq was met with both support and opposition, but as the years went on and casualties mounted, the war's true costs became increasingly apparent. The conflict resulted in the deaths of over 4,400 American soldiers, tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and the displacement of millions more. The human toll, combined with the financial burden and the region's ongoing instability, has left many questioning whether the sacrifice was worthwhile. Throughout the course of the war, the U.S. faced numerous challenges, including managing a complex and evolving insurgency, addressing serious sectarian strife within the country, and attempting to promote stability and democratic governance in a region plagued by constant upheaval. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces was often a slow and arduous process. Additionally, strained relations with the Iraqi government and an increasing war-weariness among the American public significantly contributed to the pressure on the U.S. military to withdraw. As the final American convoy exited Iraq, the remaining troops reflected on their experiences and sacrifices. Many expressed mixed emotions about leaving, with some highlighting concerns that the country might not yet be prepared to handle the daunting task of maintaining its own stability and security without international assistance. At the same time, many soldiers expressed a sense of relief and accomplishment, having played a role in toppling a brutal regime and giving the Iraqi people a chance to rebuild their nation. The withdrawal marked the end of an era in American military operations and a contentious period in U.S. foreign policy. The consequences and lasting effects of the war will undoubtedly continue to be debated for years to come. As soldiers return home to reunite with their loved ones, the legacy of the war will remain ever-present in the lives of those who fought, those who lost, and those who were forever changed by the conflict. In the years following the withdrawal, the U.S. has continued to grapple with the repercussions of its actions in Iraq. The rise of ISIS and the continued instability in the region have underscored the ongoing challenges of crafting effective policies in an increasingly interconnected and volatile world. The lessons learned from the conflict in Iraq will undoubtedly continue to inform and shape American foreign policy, with the true consequences of the war still unfolding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): === The answer to the above question is  - Fans of macaroni and cheese.; - Overweight or obese.; - not enough information; - University researchers.; Answer:","output":"Overweight or obese."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility.

Identify the major highways in Maine for Question 1 and Kansas for Question 2. 3. Compare the major highways in California with those in Maine and Kansas. 4. Determine if the answers to the two questions are the same or different based on the comparison. Step 1: Identify the major highways in California. - I-5 (Interstate 5): This is a major north-south route that runs along the western coast of the United States, connecting the Mexican and Canadian borders. - I-10 (Interstate 10): This is a major east-west route that runs from Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida. - I-80 (Interstate 80): This is another major east-west route that runs from San Francisco, California to Teaneck, New Jersey. - US-101 (U.S. Route 101): This is a significant north-south route that runs along the Pacific Coast, connecting California, Oregon, and Washington. Step 2: Identify the major highways in Maine and Kansas. - Major highways in Maine:   - I-95 (Interstate 95): This is a major north-south route that runs from Miami, Florida to Houlton, Maine near the Canadian border.   - I-295 (Interstate 295): This is a shorter auxiliary route that connects Portland and other areas along the coast. - Major highways in Kansas:   - I-70 (Interstate 70): This is a major east-west route that runs from Cove Fort, Utah to Baltimore, Maryland.   - I-35 (Interstate 35): This is a major north-south route that runs from Laredo, Texas to Duluth, Minnesota. Step 3: Compare the major highways in California with those in Maine and Kansas. - Comparing California and Maine:   - California has more major interstate highways (3 vs 1).   - California's highways cover larger distances and connect more states compared to Maine's highways.   - Both states have a coastal route; California has US-101, while Maine has I-295. - Comparing California and Kansas:   - Both states have comparable numbers of major interstates (California has 3 major interstates, while Kansas has 2).   - California's highways cover larger distances compared to Kansas's highways.   - California has coastal routes (I-5 and US-101), while Kansas does not have any coastal highways. Step 4: Determine if the answers to the two questions are the same or different based on the comparison. - The answers to the two questions are different because the comparisons between California and Maine major highways and California and Kansas major highways have distinct attributes. The number of major interstates and the presence of coastal routes are different between the two comparisons.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

However, there is no direct information regarding the emotional state (i.e., being livid) of that group. It does mention that a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, but that doesn't automatically imply that the group the speaker guarded her from was livid.

Question: What chemical causes emeralds to be green? Is Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.\\" is a good answer to the question. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, you can add more information on how chromium influences the color, the composition of emeralds, and other factors that can contribute to the green color. Emeralds are a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18), which in its pure form is colorless. The green color in emeralds is primarily caused by trace amounts of chromium (Cr) and, in some cases, vanadium (V) ions replacing aluminum (Al) ions in the beryl crystal structure. This substitution causes the absorption of certain wavelengths of light, leading to the characteristic green coloration. When chromium ions replace aluminum, a phenomenon called intervalence charge transfer occurs. In this process, the chromium ions absorb light in the yellow-orange and blue-violet regions of the spectrum, effectively reflecting and transmitting the corresponding complementary color, which in this case is green. This occurs because energy in the form of light is transferred between two different oxidation states, Cr^3+ and Cr^2+, within the crystal structure. Vanadium can also cause a green color in emeralds, although they generally produce a more bluish-green hue compared to chromium-rich emeralds. Similar to chromium, vanadium ions replace aluminum ions in the beryl crystal lattice. The coloration caused by vanadium is due to the d-d electron transitions within the vanadium ions. These transitions lead to the selective absorption of light in the different regions, creating the appearance of green color. Another factor contributing to the green color of emeralds is the presence of iron (Fe) ions. Although iron's influence is usually minimal, it can contribute to the intensity and hue of the green color. Emeralds with higher iron content may appear more bluish-green, while those with lower iron content can exhibit a more saturated and pure green hue. It is important to note that the impurities and the concentration of chromium, vanadium, and iron, as well as the specific crystal lattice structure, will determine the exact shade and intensity of the green in emeralds. This variability in color can be seen in emeralds sourced from different regions across the world. In summary, the primary cause for the green color of emeralds is the presence of chromium ions replacing aluminum in the beryl crystal lattice. In some cases, vanadium ions and iron ions can also play a role in coloration. The specific shade and intensity of the green color depend on the impurity concentrations and crystal structure of an individual emerald."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recruited into a fierce and all-female ISIS brigade, Khadija underwent extensive training to become a lethal weapon herself. This included learning how to clean, dismantle, and fire various guns and other weaponry. Through this training, she was indoctrinated into the ideology and tactics that ISIS employs to maintain its power and control. The female ISIS brigade's members were skilled and ruthless, carrying out punishments in line with the group's rigid and brutal interpretation of Islamic law. However, despite her training and commitment to the cause, Khadija could not turn a blind eye to the senseless brutality and destruction that ISIS wreaked upon innocent people. As time went by, she became disillusioned with the group's actions and ideology, causing an internal struggle between her loyalty to the brigade and her own conscience. Her decision to defect from the group was a dangerous one since she was marked as a traitor and would be relentlessly hunted down if found. Defectors from ISIS are often met with gruesome consequences, so choosing this path meant that Khadija was putting her life at risk. Seeking refuge in Urfa, Turkey, she hid her identity with tremendous care, aiming to leave her past behind and start afresh. Her interview with CNN was the first time she had ever opened up about her experiences with the group and her brave decision to leave it all behind. Khadija's story serves as a testament to the extreme lengths that terrorist organizations go in recruiting and training their soldiers, even women who once held a secondary status within these groups.

Paragraph: Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.  Question: \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\" Answer: \\"The Russian Revolution\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct. The economic upsurge that the zaibatsu conglomerates took advantage of was not directly related to the Russian Revolution. The zaibatsu conglomerates thrived due to the rapid industrialization and expansion of Japan's economy during the early 20th century, including increased raw-material production, manufactured goods, and heavy industry development.

Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\"  However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives. Many Democrats believe a focus on Trump could help them retake control of the House next year. \\"You can sort of smell when a wave is beginning, no guarantee it continues, but it is likely to,\\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\"And that smell that was in the air in 2005 is in the air now.\\" Trump's approval ratings remain historically low for a first-year president — with several recent polls showing him below 40 percent — which could be a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections.  \\"If the president is where he is today, I think that is going to be very difficult for the party to even hold the House of...

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Problem:This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men. But Madras(played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is no actor, but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well. Still, they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film. If you liked buddy cop films, cheesy 80's movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie. Solution:","output":"The task here involves an analysis of a movie review, categorizing it as either positive or negative based on the details provided within the review.  Looking at the guidelines provided:  1) Positive: If the details of the review are generally optimistic, praising the film or specific elements of the film, or recommend viewers to see the movie, it is categorized as positive. 2) Negative: If the details of the review are generally negative, criticizing the film or specific elements of the film, or discourage viewers from seeing the movie, it is categorized as negative. For this review, it mentions that the movie has \\"genuinely amusing parts\\" and \\"ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie\\". Additionally, the reviewer states that if you are a fan of buddy cop films, cheesy 80s movies, or are interested in seeing Jay Leno as an actor, then they would recommend the movie. Therefore, based on these details, it is clear the review is largely favorable of the movie.  Hence, we can categorize this review as a \\"Positive\\" review as it aligns with the guidelines provided for positive movie reviews. It's important to note that a positive review can still contain some criticism, as long as the overall tone commends the film. In this case, the reviewer seems to enjoy the movie despite pointing out some absurdity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Almost 150 whales die in mass stranding      A group of up to 145 pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on Stewart Island in New Zealand.      The animals were discovered by a walker late on Saturday, strewn along the beach of Mason Bay.      Authorities said half the whales had already died by then, while the other half were put down as it would have been too difficult to save them.      In separate incidents, 12 pygmy whales and a sperm whale also beached in New Zealand over the weekend.      'A heart-breaking decision'      The pilot whales were beached in two pods about 2km (1.2 miles) apart on a remote beach on Rakiura or Stewart Island off the coast of South Island.      \\"Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low,\\" Ren Leppens of the regional Department of Conservation (DOC) said in a statement.      \\"The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise.\\"      \\"However, it's always a heart-breaking decision to make.\\"      The DOC said in a statement that whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand and that there are about 85 incidents a year. In most cases, though, it's just a single animal that is beached, not a whole pod.      It's not fully known why whales or dolphins strand, the agency said. Possible reasons might be sickness, navigational errors, falling tides or being chased by a predator.      Also over the weekend, 12 pygmy whales were found stranded at the northern tip of North Island. Four of them have died.      There are hopes that the remaining eight can still be rescued and efforts are under way by local marine mammal charity Project Jonah.      The group said it planned to re-float the whales on Tuesday and has asked for volunteers to help.      On another North Island beach, a 15m (50ft) sperm whale died on Saturday morning. ||||| More than 140 pilot whales die in 'heartbreaking' New Zealand stranding      More than 140 pilot whales have died on a remote New Zealand beach, the latest in a recent string of whale strandings and deaths in the country.      On Saturday night the Department of Conservation [DoC] was informed of a mass whale stranding in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.      A hiker camping in the remote location told authorities of the tragedy, with the number of whales equating to two pods.      DOC Rakiura operations manager Ren Leppens said at least half of the whales were dead by the time staff arrived at the scene.      Indonesia: dead whale had 1,000 pieces of plastic in stomach Read more      “Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low. The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales’ deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise,” said Leppens. “However, it’s always a heartbreaking decision to make.”      The local Māori, tribe, Ngāi Tahu, is now working with DOC to bless the dead whales and make plans for burial of the bodies.      Marine strandings are common in New Zealand, with the country a “hotspot”, according to DOC, who respond to about 85 incidents a year, usually of single animals.      Since 1840, more than 5,000 strandings have been recorded around the New Zealand coastline.      According to DOC the reasons for whale strandings are not fully understood, but contributing factors can include “sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather”.      Project Jonah, a whale rescue group says New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, with an average of 300 whales and dolphins beaching themselves every year.      A series of whale strandings occurred over the weekend in New Zealand, but the incidents are so far thought to be unrelated.      Eight pygmy whales remain stranded on 90 mile beach in Northland, with two others from the same pod euthanised over the weekend.      A 15-metre male sperm whale beached and died at Doubtful Sound on Saturday, while a female pygmy sperm whale washed up dead at Ohiwa over the weekend.      Last year more than 400 pilot whales were stranded in Golden Bay, the largest whale stranding in New Zealand’s history. Although hundreds of locals participated in a mass civilian rescue effort, more than 300 whales died. ||||| Summary:","output":"A lot of whales got stuck on a beach on an island in New Zealand, and sadly, almost 150 of them died. People tried to help, but it was very difficult to save them. Whales sometimes get stuck on beaches, and nobody knows exactly why, but it could be because they are sick or having trouble finding their way. This happened to some other whales in New Zealand too, but these cases might not be related. People are trying their best to help the whales that are still alive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:-  Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the rock cycle is the transformation of the metamorphic rocks back into magma, completing the cycle and starting the process anew. This occurs when the metamorphic rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure, typically due to subduction or geological events such as volcanic activity. In detail, when the metamorphic rocks are exposed to these high temperatures and pressures, they begin to melt and transform into a semi-molten or fully molten state. This molten material, now referred to as magma, will slowly rise towards the Earth's surface due to its lower density compared to the solid rocks surrounding it. As the magma continues to rise, it may be stored within chambers in the Earth's crust or upper mantle, where it could reside for thousands to millions of years.  Over time, the conditions in these magma chambers may change, leading to the development of new magma compositions and the growth of various minerals. The magma will eventually reach the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions, fissures, or other geological pathways. As the magma is released onto the Earth's surface as lava, it cools and solidifies, forming new igneous rocks. The newly-formed igneous rocks are then subjected to various processes of erosion and weathering, including wind, water, ice, and chemical reactions. Over time, these forces break down the igneous rocks into smaller fragments, known as sediments. These sediments are transported and then deposited in various environments, such as riverbeds, lakes, oceans, or deserts, where they eventually accumulate and lithify, transforming into sedimentary rocks. As the Earth's tectonic plates continue to move and interact, the sedimentary rocks may be buried, subjected to significant heat and pressure, and eventually transform into metamorphic rocks. These metamorphic rocks can then be remelted into magma, thus completing the rock cycle and allowing the process to begin once again. This cyclical nature of rock formation and transformation is a vital part of the Earth's geological history and helps shape the landscapes and environments we see today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason wanted to sell the house.. (ii). Michael wanted to sell the house..","output":"Jason had been a trusted contractor in the community for years, known greatly for his attention to detail and exceptional craftsmanship. When Michael had approached him about doing a bathroom renovation on his home, Jason was eager to take the project on and deliver exceptional results. Every tile, fixture, and finish was chosen with precision, and Michael was thrilled with the outcome. However, when it came time for Michael to sell the home, things took a turn for the worse. During a routine home inspection, the house failed to pass various requirements, and Michael was mortified. It turned out that there were several issues in the newly renovated bathroom, despite Jason's previous claim of expertise and adherence to codes and regulations. The first issue arose from an improper installation of the bathroom's electrical outlets. The outlets were not equipped with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), a potentially lethal oversight. This type of outlet is crucial in areas with water and functions to automatically cut off the power when a ground-fault is detected, helping to avoid disastrous outcomes, such as electrocution. Secondly, there appeared to be issues with the renovated bathroom's plumbing system. The inspector discovered improper sloping of the bathroom floor, which led to pooling water and raised concerns about the possibility of water damage and mold growth in the future. In addition to this, the plumbing beneath the sink was not up to code – trap arms were installed at incorrect angles, contributing to slow drainage and the risk of sewer gas infiltrating the house. Thirdly, poor ventilation had been flagged by the inspector as a significant concern in the renovated bathroom. The bathroom's internal humidity needs to be managed efficiently to prevent the development of harmful mold and mildew. Unfortunately, Jason had neglected to install a vent fan during the renovation, despite this being an important aspect of bathroom construction and code requirements. Among these infractions, the inspector also noted that the showerhead installed by Jason was not compliant with water-efficiency standards. As ecological consciousness and sustainability become increasingly integral to contemporary home construction and renovation, the non-compliant showerhead was an unwelcome surprise for Michael. Naturally, Michael was disillusioned and disappointed with Jason's work on his bathroom renovation. He confronted Jason about these shortcomings, feeling extremely betrayed by a man who had provided exceptional service to countless others in the community. Jason, in turn, was shocked that his work had failed inspection and felt tremendous remorse for the predicament he had put Michael in. Taking responsibility for his errors, Jason set out to rectify each issue in Michael's bathroom, ensuring everything is up to code and the house would pass the inspection. In the meantime, Michael had to temporarily postpone the sale of his home and inform potential buyers of the ongoing situation, which resulted in lost opportunities and mounting frustration. Once Jason had completed the necessary adjustments and repairs to the renovated bathroom, Michael was able to proceed with the sale of his house. Though this crisis had put a serious strain on their relationship, their shared experience ultimately led to a stronger understanding of each other's values and the importance of adhering to the highest possible standards in construction. Despite the challenges and setbacks, Michael was grateful for Jason's commitment to fixing the problem and taking responsibility for his actions. In the end, Michael sold his house, surpassing its original market value, and Jason emerged from the experience as a more conscientious and skilled contractor, dedicated to refining his craft and righting the wrongs that had arisen in Michael's bathroom renovation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Indian Navy Officer Sadly Passes Away in Accident on Ship in Mumbai Once upon a time in a big city in India called Mumbai, there was a large place where people were building ships. This place was called a dockyard. Ships are big boats that can travel on water and carry people and things from one place to another. Many people work at dockyards to make sure the ships are built safely and can sail without any problems.  One day, there was a group of special people called naval officers. They work for the Indian navy, which is a group of trained people who protect their country on the water. Naval officers are very important and have many responsibilities, like making sure ships are built correctly and being in charge of the people who work on them. Sadly, something went wrong while building a ship at the dockyard in Mumbai. An accident happened, and one of the naval officers was hurt so badly that he didn't survive. An accident is when something unplanned and not good happens, like tripping and falling or a glass breaking on the floor. Sometimes accidents happen even when people are very careful. The people who work at the dockyard and the Indian navy got very sad when they heard about the accident. They talked to each other and tried to find out what caused the accident, so they can prevent more accidents in the future. They also want to make sure the family of the navy officer who passed away is taken care of.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience.

According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

Question: Given the background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  Answer the following question: Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions? Answer:","output":"Given the provided background and situation, the town that would likely have more cyclists riding in slippery conditions is the town where Bob's bike repair shop is located. This is because Bob's town is described as having a hilly area with more precipitation. These conditions can lead to slippery surfaces, especially during or after precipitation. Furthermore, the town is full of bike trails which attract more cyclists. In contrast, Rob's town, located in the valley and near the parks, isn't specifically described as having such conditions.

With Congress seeking official numbers on immigrant/child separation along the southwest border and officials refusing to provide it, the Times dug up federal data showing that over 700 children (100 of them under age 4) have been separated from adults in the past six months. The Department of Homeland Security eventually acknowledged the numbers but said it was to \\"protect the best interests of minor children crossing our borders\\" and not to deter illegal immigration. Such children torn from families are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which try to find a US guardian or relative to take the child—but if none emerge, the child can remain stuck in custody. Last year, as secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly floated the idea of child/guardian separation at borders, telling CNN he was considering it \\"in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network. ...

However, reports of child/guardian separations have surfaced despite no official policy announcement, leading to questions about the border practices in place. Evidence of child/guardian separations: The New York Times found that over 700 children, 100 of them under age four, have been separated from adults along the southwest border in the past six months. As Congress sought official numbers on immigrant/child separations and faced refusal from officials, the Times' discovery of this federal data exposed the discrepancy between the official narrative and actual border practices. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later acknowledged these numbers, but argued it was to protect children's best interests. Growing concerns and backlash: Such separated children are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which attempt to locate a US guardian or relative to care for the child. In cases where no suitable guardian emerges, children can remain in custody for extended periods. Critics argue that these practices cause unnecessary trauma to children and families, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents, seeking to halt further separations. Conclusion: The issue of child/guardian separations at borders remains contentious and underreported. The existing system is challenged by the varying narratives provided by government agencies and the interests of immigrant families. As legal battles ensue, the future of separated children and the policy's influence on immigration remains unpredictable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read the following article and answer the question. He held so tightly that his knuckles turned white , and his body flickered with a purplish shimmer . He had to stay in control . He had to . What might be true of him ?","output":"Based on the given information from the article, several potential interpretations and truths about the character can be inferred: 1. Emotional turmoil or struggle: The character's grip being described as \\"so tightly that his knuckles turned white\\" suggests that he might be experiencing strong emotions, which could include fear, anger, desperation, or stress. His determination to stay in control speaks to an ongoing struggle within him, heightening the implication that he is dealing with a difficult situation, both emotionally and mentally. 2. Holding onto something of great importance: The tight grip could also imply that the character is holding onto an object or person that is crucial to him at this specific moment. The urgency to stay in control could mean that losing that grip could result in disastrous consequences. 3. Possessing supernatural or extraordinary abilities: The description of the character's body \\"flickering with a purplish shimmer\\" implies that there might be something otherworldly or magical about him. This could mean that he is a supernatural being or a human with extraordinary powers. In this context, staying in control might refer to managing his powers to prevent any unintended harm to himself or others around him. 4. A critical situation: The combined description of his physical grip, the purplish shimmer, and the urgent need to stay in control could indicate that the character is in a high-stakes, potentially life-threatening situation. He may be trying to prevent a disastrous event, protect someone, or overcome a dangerous foe. 5. A pivotal character moment: The intense description of the character's actions and emotions might be highlighting a significant moment in the character's development. The struggle for control might represent his effort to rise above the challenges and problems he has faced up to this point. Overcoming this particular hurdle may ultimately lead to personal growth and transformation, impacting the remainder of his story. In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint a single, specific truth about the character based only on the provided excerpt. However, it can be inferred that he is experiencing a significant struggle, be it emotional, situational, or supernatural. The situation seems to be resulting from an intense, perhaps critical event, and his personal stakes are high.

Today, we're going to talk about a special bird called a cockatiel. These cute birds are super fun to have as pets, but just like any other animal, they might get scared or upset sometimes. If they feel scared, they might bite us. Ouch! But don't worry, we can learn how to be friends with them. I'll tell you some tips on what to do if a cockatiel bites and how to make the birdie feel calm and happy! 1. Staying Calm If a cockatiel bites us, it doesn't mean it doesn't like us. Maybe the little birdie is just scared or not feeling well. If this happens, it's essential to stay calm and not make any fast or loud movements. Just take a deep breath and slowly move your hand away. That way, our birdie friend will feel safer too. 2. No Punishments Even though it might hurt when a cockatiel bites us, we mustn't get angry or punish the bird. Remember: birds and animals don't understand punishment like we do. Instead of making the bird feel better, punishing it might make it even more scared or upset. We want to help our cockatiel friend feel happy and comfy around us. 3. Gently Petting the Cockatiel Cockatiels love being gently touched and petted on their head or neck. But we can only pet them if they're calm and relaxed. That means no sudden moves or loud noises! Just hold out your hand slowly and let the birdie come to you. If the cockatiel is calm and lets you touch it, you can gently give it a little pet. 4. Making the Birdie Happy To make sure our cockatiel friend stays happy and relaxed, we should spend time with it every day to play and talk. We can also give it yummy treats and toys to keep it busy. Remember, happy and healthy cockatiels are less likely to bite or feel scared. In conclusion, kids, it's crucial that we learn how to stay calm, not punish the bird, and only pet the cockatiel if it's relaxed to become friends with our lovely feathered pals. If we follow these tips, we'll have a great time with our cockatiel friends, and they'll be feeling safe and happy around us!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: -  The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can take her to lunch, or go for a walk somewhere you both enjoy. Research has shown that mildly depressed people’s moods improve when a task diverts attention to something external such as an activity. Being in a better mood can make it easier for you to be able to open up and talk about your feelings. If you're not in the mood to do an activity, don’t feel pressured to plan one. A conversation over a cup of tea at the kitchen table or on the couch can suffice. The best way to start is to tell her that you have something important you want to share, so she knows not to take your conversation lightly.  If you don't know how to bring it up or feel uncomfortable, try saying something like, \\"Hey, I’ve been feeling kind of weird/down/upset lately. Do you think we could talk about it?\\" Make it clear from the beginning of the conversation whether you want her to listen and hear what you have to say, or want her opinion or suggestions. Be sure to let your friend know whether what you're telling them is private or if they are permitted to communicate your difficulties to other people on your behalf. Be as specific and direct as possible. Don't dance around what you need or what you're requesting. It's okay if you get a little tongue-tied and shaky as you talk. Just talking is the hardest part!  If you’re having a hard time dealing with your emotions during the actual conversation, it’s okay to admit this to your friend. Letting them know how hard the conversation is for you might even be helpful to your friend to understand your state of mind and how serious the situation is. If you begin to feel overwhelmed at any point during the conversation, it’s okay to take a break, take a deep breath and gather your thoughts. If your friend seems uneasy, break the tension by thanking her for being there and listening, or apologizing for taking up her time or having a hard time talking about it (if that is true). Individuals with depression are sometimes prone to feeling guilty. Guilt can be persistent, but it can also be managed and minimized. If you feel guilty during your conversation, one useful way to manage this perceived guilt is to remember that guilty thoughts are not facts. You are not burdening your friend by sharing your feelings. Your friend is more likely to feel grateful that you trusted her with this information and eager to help your recovery than she is to feel the \\"burden\\" you envision. For your conversation to work, your friend needs to be listening to you completely. There are many ways to hold her attention, including making eye contact, using gesturing and body language (e.g., facing the person, not having your arms or legs crossed), speaking clearly, and avoiding outside distractions (e.g., background noise, people passing, cell phones ringing).  Look for signs of active listening. When a person is listening closely, they are deeply focused, trying to understand what you're saying. Check for cues like eye contact, nodding, or meaningful responses to what you're saying (even \\"uh-huh\\" can be meaningful!). People also show that they understand a conversation with their contributions to that conversation. They might repeat or paraphrase what was said, ask follow-up questions, and otherwise be working to keep the conversation going.   When people stop understanding or are at a loss for words, they may use filler words. Filler words are “go to” words and can vary from person to person. They may use the same phrases over and over again (e.g., “that is interesting”). They may also trail off (i.e., not finish sentences) or not be working to keep the conversation going. Be aware, however, that these responses can vary from person to person. For example, some people think more clearly when they aren't making eye contact and may deliberately avoid it in order to concentrate on what you are saying. Think about how your friend talks and how she acts when she's paying attention. \\" When a person (like your friend) wants to help, she wants to know what actions she can take. This is part of human psychology: we feel good when we do something for others. Helpful actions can also alleviate some of the guilt your friend might feel when she sees you in distress. You should talk about your feelings as much as you need to, but it helps to end the conversation with something concrete or specific your friend can help you with (such as letting you vent about your feelings for half an hour or taking you out to get your mind off your problems). Recall what you had decided to request or hope for when you were preparing for this conversation and tell your friend about that. Pay attention to your friend and how the conversation is going. When you feel it's time to move on, suggest a different topic or move to end the conversation by saying something like, “We should be getting home,” or, “I’ll let you go, I don’t want to take up too much of your time.” This move is mostly likely up to you, as your friend may feel uncomfortable ending the conversation.

One of the biggest factors in most students' graduate program evaluation is how each program ranks nationally. These rankings can give you a better idea of how a given program stacks up to other programs across the country, typically broken down into factors like graduation rate, internship opportunities, and cost of tuition. Choices: (1). Most certificates will cover basic analytical reasoning, or just written down in a way that the student can easily memorize. The academic rating rating for each program is very specific, and some programs do not have any assessment standards at all. (2). The most recent graduate on the rankings will usually major in a top-tier program. Since that ranking would be a relatively small percentage of students' success, the designation will be fairly secure. (3). Start by talking to friends, colleagues, and professors to find out what type of reputation a given school's program has. Read objective rankings online that compare programs across the country. (4). Many programs will not require an mba. Most programs in a graduate program will require that you have a 5-year degree, more frequent hours of practice and an experience with mba programs in addition to a brief course of study.","output":"When choosing the right MBA program, it is essential to consider several key factors to ensure that the program aligns with your personal and professional goals. To make an informed decision, follow these steps: 1. Determine your goals and objectives: Clearly identify your short-term and long-term objectives, such as the industry you want to work in, the specific type of job, or whether you plan to start your own business. Your choice of MBA program should be aligned with these goals. 2. Research the program's academic ranking: As mentioned above, academic rankings are crucial when evaluating MBA programs. Utilize trustworthy ranking sources, such as US News & World Report, Financial Times, and Bloomberg Businessweek, to compare programs on factors like graduation rate, faculty credentials, and internship opportunities. 3. Examine the curriculum and specialization options: Ensure that the program offers coursework and areas of focus that align with your interests and career goals. Some MBA programs may have stronger focuses on certain industries, such as technology, healthcare, or finance. 4. Assess the reputation and network: Reaching out to friends, colleagues, and professors for their insights on different schools can provide valuable information about each program's reputation. Additionally, consider the strength and size of each program's alumni network, as connections can be invaluable for career advancement. 5. Calculate the return on investment (ROI): An MBA program is a significant investment, so there needs to be a balance between the cost, potential salary increases, and opportunities that the program will provide. Analyze factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, program duration, and post-graduation salary potential. 6. Consider the program format: MBA programs come in various formats, such as full-time, part-time, and online. Assess which type of program suits your needs based on your availability, work commitments, and personal preferences. 7. Visit the campus and attend information sessions: Touring the physical campus and attending information sessions, either in-person or virtually, can help you gain a better understanding of the learning environment, facilities, and campus culture. This can be an important factor for many students when choosing the right MBA program. 8. Evaluate faculty credentials: Research the backgrounds, educational experiences, and professional achievements of the faculty members. A strong team of professors with industry experience can enhance the learning experience for MBA students. 9. Focus on internship and job placement opportunities: A good MBA program should have strong connections with companies in various industries, providing students with valuable hands-on experience and job placement possibilities. Research the career services and networking events offered by each program. 10. Speak with current students and alumni: Reach out to current students and alumni to gather more insight into their experiences with a particular program. This will help you understand the program from their perspective, which can provide valuable information when making a decision. By considering these factors and doing thorough research, you will be well-equipped to choose the right MBA program that aligns with your goals, preferences, and professional aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: 'No threat found' after 19,000 students evacuated on Prince Edward Island More than 19,000 students in the small Canadian province of Prince Edward Island were evacuated on Wednesday after police received a threat saying that bombs had been placed at a number of schools. Police said nothing suspicious was found after officers searched all of the schools in the province. “The minister of public safety just informed me that all of the schools’ children and personnel are safe. The situation is under control,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said at a news conference in Ottawa. Sgt Kevin Baillie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the Prince Edward Island threat came via fax on Wednesday morning, and that schools on the normally sleepy island were notified within 10 minutes. “There’s been no threat found. Everybody is safe,” he told reporters. The threat was faxed to police in Canada’s capital of Ottawa, Baillie said. “The message stated that the bombs had been placed at a number of schools and would be detonated today,” he said. A senior police official said a “swatting”-style computer distributed a threat to jurisdictions across Canada and in the US and authorities were trying to locate the source. Swatting is when someone contacts emergency services to deceive officials and report a bogus threat so that emergency personnel go to a scene. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation. Police in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the central part of Canada are also investigating a threat against the city’s largest school division that appears similar to the one on Prince Edward Island. Police say the Winnipeg school division received a faxed message about 8.30am that contained a threat to all schools within its jurisdiction. Schools were not evacuated or placed in lockdown. Students at more than 60 English language and French language schools in Prince Edward Island were taken to safe locations by staff outside the schools, where buses met them. Baillie said bomb threats were hard to evaluate for credibility, but said authorities like to err on the side of caution. “This disrupts a lot of lives,” he said. Parents and guardians were asked to wait for further instructions before picking up their children. Trudeau said he empathized with parents. “As a parent, I know how worrisome this type of situation can be. I know the affected parents must be having a difficult day,” Trudeau said. Parker Grimmer, the island’s director of public schools, said police had contacted the school system on Wednesday morning about “a threat that was of a significant nature” and asked for the evacuation of all schools. He said he expected all students to return to classes on Thursday. “This is new to us, so we are reacting in a new way,” Grimmer said. “But we have plans and procedures and I think we followed them.” At Holland College in the provincial capital of Charlottetown, a woman burst into the classroom to tell everyone to pick up their books and evacuate immediately, student Morgan McNeil said. Outside, everyone was in a panic and helicopters were flying overhead, he said. Baillie said similar threats had been made to schools and colleges in the nearby province of Nova Scotia, where the Nova Scotia Community College Marconi campus, Cape Breton University and the NSCC technology campus in Halifax were evacuated. At least one school in the US was also threatened, he said. It was not immediately clear which one was involved or if it was evacuated.

Not long after, Alan passed away. Hours after news broke that the Golden Globe-nominated actor had died, Carter, 19, took to social media to pay tribute to the father of three. “Today I lost my best friend and my idol, and the world lost one of it’s finest. You are a legend and I love you Pops. Until next time,” Carter tweeted alongside a photo of him standing next to his dad. Alan was born in Canada and enjoyed playing ice hockey — Canada’s most prevalent winter sport — with Carter. In July 2015, Alan shared a sweet photo of the father-son duo on the ice rink. “Like Father, like son. The Thicke apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. #CanadianAndProud #Hockey #TBT,” he captioned the picture of the two donning hockey uniforms. Following his father’s passing, Robin Thicke spoke to the Los Angeles Times about the man he greatly respected and loved. Robin, 39, told the newspaper that his father was “the greatest man I ever met” and said of Alan, “the good thing was that he was beloved and he had closure.” Although his death was unexpected, the musician told the Times that he recently spent time with his father, during which he shared his great love and respect for the Growing Pains actor. “I saw him a few days ago and told him how much I loved and respected him,” Robin said about seeing his dad just days prior to his death.

It combines party identification and political ideology without offering a clear breakdown by party. It states that 29% of CNN viewers said they were Republicans, and 36% called themselves conservatives. This information does not allow us to deduce the percentages of CNN viewers who describe themselves as Democrats or Independents. Similarly, we don't have information about the percentage of Fox viewers who identify as conservatives or liberals. In conclusion, the two sentences do not mean the same, as they present incomparable and incomplete information about the political affiliations of Fox and CNN viewers. For a meaningful comparison, we would need percentages for all three party affiliations (Republican, Democrat, and Independent) and the political ideologies (conservative, liberal, and moderate) for both networks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American television personality and business woman. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification.  Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\".

This transition is characterized by the completion of physical, mental, emotional, and social development from childhood to a mature stage. We can break this down further into several aspects that contribute to this transformation: 1. Physical growth: As the child continues to grow, their body undergoes various changes, such as increased height, weight, muscle mass, and bone density. Puberty is initiated during this stage, with the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of the reproductive capacity. Physiological processes and organ systems also continue to mature, ultimately reaching optimal functionality in adulthood. 2. Cognitive development: The brain undergoes significant growth and development during childhood and adolescence. This period is characterized by improvements in various cognitive abilities, such as memory, problem-solving, decision-making, and abstract thinking. By the time an individual reaches adulthood, they possess the necessary intellectual skills to navigate complex tasks and responsibilities effectively. 3. Emotional development: Emotional maturity is also a critical aspect of the transition to adulthood. As children grow, they develop the ability to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions. They also learn to empathize with others and establish healthy social connections. By the time they reach adulthood, individuals should have a robust emotional understanding and awareness that allows them to maintain stable relationships and cope with life's challenges. 4. Social development: The development of social skills and interpersonal relationships plays a crucial role in the child becoming an adult. As children and adolescents interact with their peers, family members, teachers, and other individuals, they learn essential social skills such as communication, empathy, cooperation, and conflict resolution. By adulthood, they become fully integrated into society, actively participating in social, professional, and civic engagements. 5. Independence and responsibility: A significant hallmark of adulthood is the ability to be self-sufficient and take responsibility for one's actions. As children grow, they gradually learn to manage their time, finances, and other responsibilities. By the time they reach adulthood, individuals are expected to be capable of making informed decisions, fostering healthy relationships, and contributing to society meaningfully. In summary, the final step in this process involves a multitude of developmental changes that culminate in the child becoming a fully mature and functioning adult. This includes physical growth, cognitive and emotional development, social aptitude, and the ability to make responsible decisions and be self-sufficient in society. It is worth noting that everyone's journey to adulthood is unique, with individual experiences and influences shaping each person's path."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the expedition's scientists, contacts the Earth ship. He states no assistance is required, warning the starship not to land; he cannot guarantee their safety. Commander John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) insists on landing co-ordinates. Adams, Lieutenant Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly), and Lieutenant \\"Doc\\" Ostrow (Warren Stevens) are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius' residence. There, Morbius claims that an unknown \\"planetary force\\" killed nearly everyone and finally vaporized their starship, the Bellerophon, as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes) and their daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) were somehow immune. Morbius fears that the Earthmen are in danger, and (silently) that Altaira is intrigued by them. The next day, Adams finds Farman educating Altaira on kissing; furious, he dismisses Farman and berates Altaira for her naivety and revealing clothes. Altaira is frustrated, but designs a new, more conservative dress to please Adams. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages equipment aboard the starship. Adams and Ostrow go to confront Morbius the following morning. Waiting for Morbius to exit his study, Adams steps outside, only to encounter Altaira wearing her new dress. Adams sincerely apologizes and Altaira notes that she tailored her dress for him. Realizing mutual affection, they kiss.

A solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely or not considered to be basic? Answer:","output":"A solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely not considered to be basic. In fact, it is considered to be highly acidic. To understand this concept, it is essential to learn about the pH scale and the properties of acidic and basic solutions. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (neither acidic nor basic). Solutions with pH values below 7 are considered acidic, whereas solutions with pH values above 7 are considered basic, or alkaline. The scale represents the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. Acidic solutions have a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) compared to basic solutions, which have a higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-). As the pH value decreases from 7 to 0, the acidity of the solution increases. Conversely, as the pH value increases from 7 to 14, the alkalinity of the solution increases. Now, considering a solution with a pH value of 1, it falls within the acidic range of the pH scale. Moreover, it is an extreme value, indicating that the solution is a very strong or highly acidic solution. Examples of such highly acidic solutions might come from strong inorganic acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In these cases, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution is significantly high. On the other hand, a basic solution with pH values closer to 14 would be considered highly alkaline, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) solutions. These solutions have a high concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and a low concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). In conclusion, a solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely not considered to be basic. Rather, it is considered highly acidic, owing to its high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and its position on the lower end of the pH scale (well below the neutral value of 7)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In 2012, the official currency of Croatia was the Croatian Kuna (HRK). The Croatian Kuna has been in use since May 30, 1994, when it replaced the Yugoslav Dinar (YUM) following Croatia's independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The name \\"Kuna\\" translates to \\"marten\\" in English, which is a small mammal found in the region. The name originates from medieval times when the pelts of these animals were utilized as a standard unit of value in trading. The Kuna is further divided into 100 smaller units known as \\"lipa,\\" which translates to \\"linden tree\\" in English. This naming was influenced by the use of linden tree leaves for currency in ancient times. Both coins and banknotes are issued for the Croatian Kuna. Coin denominations available are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 lipa, as well as 1, 2, and 5 Kuna coins. Banknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 Kuna. The design of the currency reflects Croatia's rich history, cultural identity, and pride, featuring images of notable Croatian individuals, landmarks, and animals. In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member of the European Union (EU). As a result, there have been discussions about the possibility of Croatia adopting the Euro (EUR) as its official currency in the future. This would replace the Kuna and place Croatia within the Eurozone, alongside other EU member countries who have adopted the Euro as their official currency. However, requirements such as meeting the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary stability must be fulfilled before Croatia can join the Eurozone. Additionally, public sentiment and potential pre-referendum polls may influence the adoption of the Euro in Croatia. In summary, the Croatian currency in 2012 was the Croatian Kuna (HRK), featuring a range of coins and banknotes that celebrated the country's rich history and cultural identity. The possibility of adopting the Euro as Croatia's official currency remains on the horizon but is subject to various economic criteria, public sentiment, and political decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers.

Both happened in Newport RI when I was in the US Navy. First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen.

Article:","output":"Title: How to Safely and Effectively Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails Introduction Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, friendly pets that require regular grooming to maintain their health and well-being. One essential aspect of their grooming routine is nail trimming, which, if neglected, can lead to painful ingrown nails, infections, and difficulty in walking. Trimming your guinea pig's nails can be a challenging task, especially if you're a beginner. However, with proper preparation, tools, and technique, you can quickly master this skill and ensure your furry buddy stays comfortable and healthy. This article will guide you through the steps necessary to safely and effectively trim your guinea pig's nails. Step 1: Gather the Necessary Supplies Before you begin, it's important to have the proper tools and supplies at hand. Here's a list of items you'll need for a successful nail trimming session: 1. Nail clippers: Choose a pair of nail clippers specifically designed for small animals, such as guinea pigs. Human nail clippers may not be suitable due to their size and shape. You can find small animal nail clippers at most pet stores or online. 2. Styptic powder or corn starch: In case you accidentally cut too short and cause the nail to bleed, you'll need a styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding. These products help promote clotting and can be found at pet supply stores or in the first aid section of your local pharmacy. 3. Hand towel: A soft, clean hand towel or small blanket is useful for swaddling your guinea pig during the nail trimming process. This can help reduce stress and keep your pet still for easier nail trimming. 4. Treats: It's a good idea to have some of your guinea pig's favorite treats on hand to reward them after the task is done. This positive reinforcement will help build a good association with the nail trimming experience. Step 2: Prepare the Area for Nail Trimming Setting up a comfortable and secure area for nail trimming is crucial for a smooth experience. Follow these steps to prepare the area: 1. Find a quiet, calm space without any distractions, such as loud noises or other pets. This will help your guinea pig stay relaxed during the process. 2. Clean a flat surface, like a table or countertop, where you can comfortably sit and work with your guinea pig. Ensure the area is dry and slip-free to prevent any accidents. 3. Place the hand towel on the surface, then spread out all the supplies you gathered in step 1 within easy reach. Step 3: Safely Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails With everything prepared, you are now ready to trim your guinea pig's nails. Follow these steps for a safe and successful nail trimming: 1. Gently wrap your guinea pig in the hand towel, leaving their head exposed for comfort. This swaddling method will help keep them calm and secure. 2. Hold your guinea pig with one hand, supporting their chest and hindquarters. With your other hand, gently extend each of your guinea pig's paws one at a time. 3. Using the small animal nail clippers, carefully trim each nail below the \\"quick,\\" which is the blood vessel that runs through the nail. The quick is easier to see in lighter nails and often appears as a pinkish area. If your guinea pig has dark nails, shine a flashlight on the nail from behind to help locate the quick. 4. Clip only a small portion of the nail tip at a time to avoid cutting the quick. If you happen to accidentally cut the quick, use the styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding promptly. Apply pressure with a clean cloth or gauze to help with clotting. 5. Repeat the process for each nail, ensuring your guinea pig stays comfortable throughout. If they show signs of stress or discomfort, take a break and allow them to rest before continuing. Step 4: Post-Trimming Care and Reward Once you've successfully trimmed all of your guinea pig's nails, it's essential to reward them for their patience and cooperation. Offer their favorite treat as positive reinforcement, and place them back in their habitat to roam freely. In conclusion, trimming your guinea pig's nails is an essential aspect of their overall health and grooming care. With the proper tools, preparation, and attention to detail, you can create a stress-free and successful nail trimming experience for you and your furry companion. Remember to maintain a regular grooming routine and be patient with your guinea pig as they become accustomed to this process. Happy grooming!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\"  Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given...

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Question: suppose the heating system breaks down happens, how will it affect the person does not sweat.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"Let us analyze the situation step by step: 1. The heating system breaks down, resulting in a possible decrease in ambient temperature. 2. A person not sweating has no sweat on their body. 3. Since there is no sweat on their body, the cooling effect caused by sweat evaporation, as mentioned in the process, does not occur for this person. Now, to answer the question, we need to determine how the breakdown of the heating system would affect a person who does not sweat: A. More: The person might be more affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation to counteract a potential drop in temperature. However, given that the heating system has broken down, it's not necessarily the case that the person would be more affected by a decrease in temperature. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer. B. Less: The person might be less affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation taking place, which might have intensified the decrease in temperature due to the broken heating system. However, the broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature and, regardless of the absence of sweat, the person may still be affected. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer either. C. No effect: The person's ability to maintain their body temperature will not be affected by the absence of sweat and its cooling effect. The broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature, but the effect on the person not sweating may not be much different from someone who does sweat. In this scenario, the absence of sweat does not play a significant role in how the person is affected by the broken heating system. Answer: C: no effect"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film","output":"The phrase \\"the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film\\" can be considered as having both positive and negative aspects. We can analyze the sentiment by breaking it down into its constituent elements. 1. The phrase's subject is \\"uncle ralph.\\" In this context, it seems to be referring to a specific character in a film, rather than a real-life individual. This, in itself, is neutral. 2. The character is described as \\"evil.\\" This word carries a definite negative connotation. Evil characters typically engage in harmful or morally reprehensible actions, and are often viewed as antagonists or villains in a narrative. 3. The descriptor \\"subtle\\" suggests that the character's evil nature isn't immediately evident or overt. This subtlety can make the character more intriguing and complex, as it adds an element of depth to their portrayal. In this sense, it could be considered positive because it could imply that the character is well-crafted and the actor's performance is nuanced. 4. The word \\"complexly\\" serves to emphasize that the character's evil nature is multifaceted and intricate. This description could also be viewed as a positive aspect, as it suggests a well-developed and engaging character, rather than a one-dimensional portrayal often found in less skillfully crafted films. 5. The phrase \\"I've ever seen in the many film\\" indicates that the speaker has watched multiple movies, and among those, this specific portrayal of \\"uncle ralph\\" stands out as being particularly noteworthy in its subtlety and complexity. This is a positive statement, as it implies that the movie featuring this character has managed to surpass others in terms of quality and impact. In summary, the negative aspect of the phrase stems from the character being described as \\"evil,\\" which usually signifies malicious intent and actions. However, the positive aspect is derived from the intricate, subtle, and complex nature of the character and its portrayal, suggesting a well-developed and engaging narrative. Overall, it's a combination of both negative and positive aspects, depending primarily on which aspect an individual chooses to focus on: the character's malevolent nature or the creator's and actor's ability to present this evil trait in a subtle and complex manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Investigators also asked the public for information on the family missing for two weeks from their home in Kenai, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage. A desperate search is underway for Michelle Hundley, five, (pictured left) and her sister, three-year-old Jaracca (right) who went missing from their Alaska home with their mother and her boyfriend last month. 'Don't assume information isn't worthwhile; we want to hear anything that may help,' Police Chief Gus Sandahl said. Adams last had contact with relatives May 27, the day after Memorial Day. The latest physical evidence of a sighting for Adams, Sandahl said, was an appearance with her children on a video surveillance recording May 18 at a Kenai business. Local police received a call. from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was. lying open at the family's home. Five. days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report. that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days. Lanell. Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister,. said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.' Rebecca Adams, 22, (left) vanished last month from her apartment in. Kenai along with her partner Brandon Jividen (right) and her two young. daughters. Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend. 'She. sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know. that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.' 'Growing. up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie' and you. always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou. shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?' She said, ''Don't ask me that right. now. Just know that I love you.' Police began investigating last weekend, and the FBI joined in the search. The family lives in a four-plex near the Wildwood Correction Facility, but they failed to pay rent this month. Residents tell the Peninsula Clarion the neighborhood is quiet but has a transitory nature. 'We don't know everybody in our building, much less buildings down the street,' said Amy Murrell-Haunold, who lives on the same street as the missing family. The FBI are looking for the two sisters who went missing with their mother and her partner in rural Alaska. Jeff Pfile and Anna Haave manage the building where the family has lived for two years. They said it was unusual for the Adams and Jividen to be late with a rent payment. 'If I felt they were going out of town I would have been the first person they called because they are so responsible (for paying their rent on time),' Haave said. 'For them to not say anything is not normal.' Police say vehicles belonging to Jividen and Adams remain parked at the four-plex, and their cellphones have been turned off. The family's brown and white English springer spaniel named Sparks also is missing. The father of her two girls, Jaramiah Hundley, died in a motorcycle crash in May 2012. Besides local police and the FBI, fire officials, canine units and wilderness search groups from across Alaska have been brought to Kenai to help search. Alaska State Troopers provided a helicopter to help search from the air, and police have used all-terrain vehicles on trails in woods near the home. The search area has expanded to areas north of the correctional facility. Dog teams. and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding. Kenai. On the lookout: A massive search for a family of four in Alaska is focusing on nearby woods and the behavior of one of the missing, a mother of two young children. The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress. Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where. they have gone or where they might be. 'The investigation. does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into. the investigation of the missing persons.' Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern. with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within. her relationship [to Brandon].' A Facebook group called Seeking. Alaska's Missing  shared a picture of the missing family and urged. anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The. poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27. Police say they receive new information about the missing family every day, but nothing that would lead to finding them or even a specific location to search. 'We remain optimistic we will be able to reunite them with their family,' Sandahl said. 'We want nothing more at this point and hope they are safe.' Family members have put up fliers of the missing family members in popular fishing areas the family frequented on the Kenai Peninsula, and police statewide have been alerted, Sandahl said. No detail about their possible whereabouts is insignificant, he said. Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.

Context: Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts. A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century. Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas, and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul.

Kamal Hamade, the well-known and loved Lebanese owner of Taverna du Liban, made sure every visitor to his restaurant had a piece of gooey cake on the house, and then some. On Saturday, the Taliban attacked the cozy Lebanese restaurant in Afghanistan's capital. One man detonated a suicide vest while two others stormed into the restaurant and fired at those inside, killing 21 people, 13 of them expatriates. One of them was Kamal. Taverna had a decent security routine in place: Visitors drove up and knocked. The Afghan guard slid open the peep hole to take a look. The patron was searched before being let in to the restaurant a short distance away from the metal-door entrance. In January 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a supermarket popular with expatriates and middle-class","output":"Afghan families, marking a shift in the insurgents' tactics toward targeting civilian spaces that were once considered relatively safe. The attack on the Finest supermarket that day shook the international community in Kabul, causing an unprecedented level of fear and uncertainty about the future. Security measures were tightened not just around embassies and official buildings, but also in restaurants, shopping centers, and other places where foreigners and affluent Afghans were known to frequent. Despite these increased security precautions, the attack on Taverna du Liban served as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and brutal nature of the Taliban's insurgency. Those who had once enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and delicious food at Kamal's restaurant now found themselves mourning the loss of a beloved community fixture. Friends and patrons from around the world expressed their heartfelt condolences on social media, sharing stories of their experiences at Taverna and cherishing the memories of Kamal's infectious smile and warm hospitality. The days following the attack saw a city enveloped in shock and grief. Families and friends of the victims held somber memorial services to honor their lost loved ones. Non-governmental organizations and foreign missions considered relocating their staff to safer locations or even leaving the country altogether. For both local residents and the expatriate community, the once-thriving social scene in Kabul had become yet another casualty of the ongoing conflict. But amidst all the pain and sorrow, there were also faint glimmers of hope and resilience. In the wake of the Taverna tragedy, Kabul's residents began to rally together, embracing a spirit of unity and defiance against the terror that had been inflicted upon their city. Vigils were held, and fundraising events were organized to support the families of those who had perished. International and Afghan artists came together to create murals, installations, and other works of art to commemorate the victims and symbolize the city's determination to rise above the violence. As life slowly started to regain some semblance of normalcy, the memories of Kamal and his famous chocolate cake continued to live on in the hearts and minds of those who had been fortunate enough to experience his generosity and warmth. People from all walks of life spoke of their resolve to keep his spirit alive by fostering a culture of camaraderie, openness, and friendship in the face of adversity. And so, while the tragic events of that fateful Saturday night in January 2011 may have cast a long shadow over Kabul, the enduring legacy of Kamal Hamade and Taverna du Liban serves as an inspiring testament to the power of community, compassion, and love in the darkest of times. The best chocolate cake in Kabul and its creator left a bittersweet taste that would forever remind the city and its people of all that they had lost, as well as all that they had gained in the process of healing and rebuilding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.  - Satan (\\"satan\\", meaning \\"enemy\\" or \\"adversary\\"; \\"shaitan\\", meaning; \\"astray\\", \\"distant\\", or sometimes \\"devil\\") is a figure appearing in the texts of the Abrahamic religions who brings evil and temptation, and is known as the deceiver who leads humanity astray. Some religious groups teach that he originated as an angel, or something of the like, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but fell because of hubris, seducing humanity into the ways of falsehood and sin, and has power in the fallen world. In the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the devil, who possesses abhorrent qualities. Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, \\"Satan\\" is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty.  - Reign in Blood is the third studio album and the major-label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released on October 7, 1986, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was the band's first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band's sound evolve. \\"Reign in Blood\\" was well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. \\"Kerrang!\\" magazine described the record as \\"the heaviest album of all\\". Alongside Anthrax's \\"Among the Living\\", Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\\" and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Reign in Blood\\" helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since then.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in December 1988, the band has released thirteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a cult following began to build after the release of the 1991 album \\"Butchered at Birth\\", and 1992 album \\"Tomb of the Mutilated\\". As of 2015, they had achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them the top-selling death metal band of all time.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - RED Distribution, LLC (formerly Relativity Entertainment Distribution) is a Sony Music Entertainment-owned sales and marketing division that handles releases for more than sixty independent record labels. It is also home to 'stache media, a marketing and brand partnership agency based in New York City.  - \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" is a 2006 single by the American thrash metal band Slayer, taken from their 2006 album \\"Christ Illusion\\". The lyrics explore an American soldier's mental anguish following his return home from the second Gulf War, and are based on an article entitled \\"Casualty of War\\" in \\"Texas Monthly\\" magazine. \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" was written by vocalist Tom Araya during pre-production for the album. The song was generally well received by critics, and also peaked #15 on the Danish singles charts.  - Lars Ulrich ( born December 26, 1963) is a Danish musician, songwriter, actor, and record producer. He is best known as the drummer and co-founder of the American heavy metal band Metallica.

Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.  - Kirk Lee Hammett (born November 18, 1962) is the lead guitarist and contributing songwriter for the heavy metal band Metallica and has been a member of the band since 1983.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:We all know that the normal human daily cycle of activity is of some 7-8 hours' sleep alternating  with some 16-17 hours' wakefulness and that the sleep normally coincides with the hours of darkness. Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed  routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts  are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently. The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence   of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work. This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the pressure of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature. People occupied in normal daytime work will have a high temperature during the hours of wakefulness and a low one at night; when they change to night work the pattern will only gradually go back to match the new routine and the... It is possible to find out if a person has adapted to the changes of routine by measuring his body temperature because  _  . A) body temperature is higher when the cycle of sleep and wakefulness alternates B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back C) the temperature reverses when the routine is changed D) people have higher temperatures when they are working efficiently A:","output":"The answer is B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back. This is because a person's body temperature tends to be higher during hours of wakefulness and lower during sleep. When they switch from day work to night work, it takes time for their body temperature pattern to adjust to the new sleep/wake cycle. By measuring body temperature, it's possible to determine if someone has successfully adapted to a change in their routine."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the question \\"Where does the conversation most likely take place?\\" and the answer \\"At a hospital.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

In a restaurant, the primary focus would be on food, and the mention of bringing books from somewhere else wouldn't be relevant to the setting.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters.

The £40m cycle and pedestrian bridge will stretch from Nine Elms to Pimlico in south London. The council hopes the bridge will boost growth in Nine Elms. Westminster City council said concerns over the proposed bridge's location had been raised by Pimlico residents. Movement by bikes and walkers in both directions at peak times is a key criteria of the proposed designs. The bridge must also be high enough to allow large boats to pass below, but not too steep for pedestrians and cyclists to climb.

Give me the correct facts to answer this: what did isaac newton discovered as a mathematician? The answer to this question is:","output":"Isaac Newton, as a mathematician, discovered and made significant contributions to several fields, most notably: 1. Calculus: He developed the mathematical framework known as calculus, which is essential for understanding various branches of mathematics and science including physics and engineering. Newton is often credited with developing the concept of a mathematical limit and the fundamentals of differential and integral calculus. 2. Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation: Newton formulated the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics and revolutionized our understanding of the physical world. 3. Optics: Newton made significant discoveries in the field of optics, including the nature of light and color. He developed the theory of color and demonstrated that white light breaks into its constituent colors when passed through a prism, leading to the development of the field of spectroscopy. 4. Newton-Raphson Method: In numerical analysis, Newton devised a powerful method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function, known as the Newton-Raphson method. Remember, while Newton is best known as a physicist, his work as a mathematician played a crucial role in shaping the course of modern science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock.   - Memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the county seat of Shelby County. The city is located on the fourth Chickasaw Bluff, south of the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Washing Machine is the ninth studio album by the American experimental rock band Sonic Youth , released on September 26 , 1995 by DGC Records . It was recorded at Easley Studios in Memphis , Tennessee and produced by the band and John Siket , who also engineered the band 's previous two albums .

Upon release , Washing Machine reached No. 58 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 39 on the UK Albums Chart . Two songs from the album , \`\` The Diamond Sea '' and \`\` Little Trouble Girl '' , were released as singles . The album received generally positive reviews from music critics , who praised the band for exploring new challenges as well as the guitar playing between band members Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo . In 1996 , the album was ranked at No. 18 in The Village Voice '  s Pazz & Jop critics ' poll for 1995 .  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend. After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the Eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus \\"Amphechinus\\" was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.  - The gymnure, also called a hairy hedgehog or moonrat, is a type of mammal belonging to the subfamily Galericinae, in the family Erinaceidae and the order Eulipotyphla. Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents: they are instead closely related to hedgehogs. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews.  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games.  - Pince-nez is a style of glasses, popular in the 19th century, that are supported without earpieces, by pinching the bridge of the nose. The name comes from French \\"pincer\\", \\"to pinch\\", and \\"nez\\", \\"nose\\".   - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - Amphechinus is an extinct genus of hedgehog of the family Erinaceidae, which lived in Asia and Europe during the Oligocene and in North America, Africa, Asia, and Europe during the Miocene.  - A shrew or shrew mouse (family Soricidae) is a small mole-like mammal classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are also not to be confused with West Indies shrews, treeshrews, otter shrews, or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Development of \\"Sonic 3\\" began shortly after the release of \\"Sonic 2\\" in November 1992. It was developed simultaneously with \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\"; as the games were originally developed as a single title until time constraints and cartridge costs later forced the team to split them in two projects. The \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" cartridge features \\"lock-on\\" technology that allows it to be physically attached to the \\"Sonic 3\\" cartridge, creating a combined game, \\"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses).  - Echidnas , sometimes known as spiny anteaters, belong to the family Tachyglossidae in the monotreme order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species, together with the platypus, are the only surviving members of the order Monotremata and are the only living mammals that lay eggs. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the Americas. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea.  - The biological family Canidae  The cat-like feliforms and dog-like caniforms emerged within the Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present. The caniforms included the fox-like \\"Leptocyon\\" genus whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11.9 million YBP into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines).  Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6 ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4 in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals.  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an ovum. Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some do not, such as scorpions and most mammals.  - In main line of video games, Dr. Eggman is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Eggman possesses ability of creating machines and robots (including wide variety of Badniks), as notably in early games, he has served as a recurring boss in almost every level for piloting one of his created vehicles.  - Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes are slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or \\"brush\\").  - Obsessive love is a hypothetical state in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom one feels a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, some people argue that obsessive love is considered to be a mental illness similar to attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and erotomania. Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves. They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love. Obsessive love has been frequently used and/or exaggerated in mass media, often with a woman having such affections for a man in either a comical or terrifying fashion.  - Mad scientist (also mad doctor or mad professor) is a caricature of a scientist who is described as \\"mad\\" or \\"insane\\" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist may be villainous (evil genius) or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane, eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - A snout is the protruding portion of an animal's face, consisting of its nose, mouth, and jaw. In many animals the equivalent structure is called a muzzle, rostrum or proboscis. The wet, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose of some animals is known as the rhinarium (colloquially this is the \\"cold wet nose\\" of some animals). The rhinarium is often associated with a stronger sense of olfaction. The snout is considered a weak point on most animals: because of its structure, an animal can be easily stunned, snapped or even knocked out by applying sufficient force.  - Eulipotyphla (\\"truly fat and blind\\") is an order of mammals suggested by molecular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, and includes the laurasiatherian members of the now-invalid polyphyletic order Lipotyphla, but not the afrotherian members (tenrecs and golden moles, now in their own order Afrosoricida). Lipotyphla in turn had been derived by removing a number of groups from Insectivora, the previously used wastebasket taxon.  - The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as \\"caudate\\" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective \\"caudal\\".  - The Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise began in 1991 with the game Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis , which pitted a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic against a rotund human man named Doctor Eggman ( or Doctor Ivo Robotnik ) . The sequel , Sonic 2 , gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails . Shortly afterward , Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose , a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic , and Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna , Sonic 's rival and , later , friend . All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games . The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years . These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E- 123 Omega , as well as human characters like Eggman 's grandfather Gerald Robotnik . The series also features two fictional species : Chao , which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements , and Wisps , which have been used as power - ups . The Sonic games keep a separate continuity from the Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and other Sonic media and , as a result , feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters .  - Monotremes are basal mammals that lay eggs (Prototheria) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials (Metatheria) and placental mammals (Eutheria). The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea, although there is evidence that they were once more widespread. The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas. There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy.  - , originally nicknamed Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character in Sega's \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series. She is a pink anthropomorphic hedgehog with a cheerful, competitive personality. Amy is known for her unrequited and obsessive love for the series' main character Sonic. They have saved each other's lives on a number of occasions, however, and are good friends. During the series' early years, her appearance changed several times.  - The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.  - Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two families of animals, the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the clade Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within Hystricognathi.  - Knuckles debuted as an antagonist in \\"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\\" in 1994; Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime. He is one of the series' most popular and recognizable characters.  - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\".  - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.  - The Sega Genesis, known as the in most regions outside North America, is a 16-bit home video game console which was developed and sold by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. The Genesis was Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega first released the console as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, followed by a North American debut under the Genesis moniker in 1989. In 1990, the console was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, by Ozisoft in Australasia, and by Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, the systems were distributed by Samsung and were known as the Super Gam*Boy, and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To brown butter","output":"Browning butter is a simple, yet transformative process that unlocks intense nutty and complex flavors from regular unsalted butter. When done right, brown butter can elevate various dishes, from sautés and pasta sauces to cookies and brownies. Here's a detailed guide to help you achieve perfectly browned butter: 1. Choose the right butter: It is essential to start with good-quality unsalted butter since the flavor of the final product greatly depends on it. Lower-quality butter might contain more water, which can affect the browning process. Unsalted butter is preferred as it allows you to control the salt content of your dish. 2. Prepare the tools: For optimal results, you'll need a light-colored pan with a heavy bottom, like stainless steel or enameled cast iron. The lighter color allows you to monitor the color change more easily, avoiding burning. Additionally, the thick bottom conducts heat more evenly, preventing the butter from scorching. You will also need a heat-resistant spatula or a wooden spoon for stirring and a bowl to collect the browned butter. 3. Cut the butter into small pieces: This ensures that the butter melts evenly and more quickly. It'll also help you to monitor the browning more effectively. 4. Heat the pan: Place the pan on the stove over medium heat and let it get warm. 5. Melt the butter: Add the butter to the pan and stir gently to promote even melting. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides to prevent any butter from sticking and brown spots from forming. 6. Monitor the stages: Keep an eye on the color change and listen to the changes in sizzling sounds. It will go through three main phases:    a. Foaming: In this first stage, the butter will foam up as the water content starts to evaporate. The sizzling will get louder and the foam will rise. Keep stirring, watching, and listening.    b. Subsiding foam: The foam will begin to subside and the butter will start to smell nutty. At this point, the milk solids will separate and sink to the bottom, so keep stirring to prevent them from burning.    c. Browning: The butter will reach a golden brown color, and the milk solids at the bottom will turn brown as well. The sizzling sound will subside, indicating that most of the water content has evaporated. 7. Keep a watchful eye: This is the critical stage when the milk solids can easily go from browned to burned. Make sure not to walk away and pay close attention to the smell, color, and sound. 8. Remove the pan from heat: As soon as the butter reaches a deep golden brown color and has a fragrant nutty smell, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the milk solids in the pan, so it is essential to remove it from the heat source at the right time. 9. Pour the browned butter into a bowl: To stop the cooking process and prevent the brown butter from burning, transfer it immediately to a heatproof bowl using the spatula or spoon to scrape every last bit. 10. Cool and store: Let the brown butter cool down before using it in your recipes. You can store it at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to a month. If refrigerated, it will solidify and require gentle reheating before using it in your dishes. By following these steps and paying attention to the visual and audible cues, you'll be able to master the art of browning butter, which is sure to indulge your senses and enhance your culinary creations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Such individuals may openly challenge or express doubt about the religion's teachings. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens to independent thinkers in this context: 1. Independent thinking is identified: When a person starts to question or express disagreement with the doctrines and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses, they are considered to be engaging in independent thinking. 2. Discouragement: Witness publications aim to suppress independent thinking, discouraging followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body. They emphasize the importance of trusting the organization as a part of \\"God's organization.\\" 3. Warning: Members are warned to avoid independent thinking, as it is said to be introduced by Satan the Devil. The religion teaches that independent thinking will cause division among its members. 4.

The highlight of the rally was the Super Special Stage in the Athens Olympic Stadium (SSS). In 2005, it was announced the Rally of the Year.  - Mikko Hirvonen (born 31 July 1980, Kannonkoski) is a Finnish former rally driver, and a current Rally-Raid driver, who drove in the World Rally Championship. He placed third in the drivers' championship and helped Ford to the manufacturers' title in both 2006 and 2007. In 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 he finished runner-up to Sébastien Loeb.

Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898.

This role is particularly critical in high-end rally competitions such as WRC. Co-drivers are also often called on to perform maintenance on the car during road sections and special stages, such as changing a wheel.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard.

They may be your friends, your teachers or your parents. Anyone can be a difficult person to someone else. It is important to see if you are with a difficult person. The first solution  to any problem is that you realize the problem. Most of the time, difficult people do not realize  they are difficult. They think what they do is just normal. But do you know how to cope with  difficult people? The best way is not to care what they said. If this does not help, think about the following: *Difficult people are easy to be very angry, and you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. *Difficult people do not even hear the words you say, but are only guessing the meaning of your words according to their own thought.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who succeeded in 1873 with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine?, using the article: Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante,  presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy  Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day., what would be the answer ?

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell.

The question is: \\"Name something a grown woman might lie about but a young girl wouldn't.\\" Answer: A grown woman might lie about her age, but a young girl usually wouldn't. Reasoning: In many societies, there is a perceived pressure on women to look and feel younger, as youthfulness is often associated with beauty and vitality. As a result, a grown woman may feel the need to lie about her age to conform to society's expectations or her own personal desires. On the other hand, young girls typically do not experience this pressure yet, as they are often eager to grow up and feel more mature. Hence, they are less likely to lie about their age.

To encourage men to get off the couch; (4). not enough information; Given those answer options, answer the question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

Article: The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane  treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as \\"cute pets\\". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create \\"entertaining\\" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic  settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose.  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly.  WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity  be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes. Question: According to the passage, what is WAZA in favour of? Options: A: Stopping importing chimpanzees. B: Never dressing any animals in human clothes. C: Taking good care of all the animals kept in places like zoos. D: Not showing Wonderful Friends on TV again after it is finished.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - In early versions of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium (see: \\"The History of Middle-earth\\"), Tol Eressëa was an island visited by the Anglo-Saxon traveller Ælfwine (in earlier versions, Eriol) which provided a framework for the tales that later became \\"The Silmarillion\\". The name is Quenya for \\"Lonely Island\\". In early versions, the Cottage of Lost Play is located in Kortirion, the island's main city, and it is here that Eriol the Mariner comes. There is an early poem by Tolkien, entitled \\"Kortirion\\", several versions of which can be found in \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", Volume I.  - Sindarin is a fictional language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien for use in his fantasy stories set in Arda (popularly called Middle-earth). Sindarin is one of the many languages spoken by the immortal Elves, called the \\"Eledhrim\\" or \\"Edhellim\\" in Sindarin. The word \\"Sindarin\\" is itself a Quenya form. The only known Sindarin word for this language is Eglathrin, a word probably only used in the First Age (see Eglath).  - In the fictional universe, or legendarium, described in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Vanyar are the fairest and most noble of the High Elves. They are the smallest of the three clans of the Eldar, and were the first to arrive in Aman. According to legend, the clan was founded by Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, with his wife Iminyë and their twelve companions. Ingwë was the Vanya Elf to travel with Oromë to Valinor, and became their king. The Vanyar speak a dialect of Quenya called Vanyarin.  - Valinor (\\"Land of the Valar\\") is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the realm of the Valar in Aman. It was also known as the Undying Lands, along with Tol Eressëa and the outliers of Aman. This latter name is somewhat misleading; the land itself, while blessed, did not cause mortals to live forever. However, only immortal beings were generally allowed to reside there. Exceptionally the surviving bearers of the One Ring were allowed to dwell there for a time  Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee  and perhaps Gimli son of Glóin who, it is said, accompanied his friend Legolas to Valinor.  - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Teleri, \\"Those who come last\\" in Quenya (singular \\"Teler\\") were the third of the Elf clans who came to Aman. Those who came to Aman became known as the Falmari or \\"sea elves\\" and these are the Elves who are generally known as Teleri, though the term also includes their Middle-earth cousins the Sindar, Laiquendi, and Nandor of Middle-earth.  - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\".  - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin).  - Aman is a fictional place in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , also known as the Undying Lands or Blessed Realm , it is the home of the Valar , and three kindreds of Elves : the Vanyar , some of the Noldor , and some of the Teleri .

Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music.

It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading.  - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus.  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.  - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire .

At that time , Sir John 's great - grandson , also Sir John , had to surrender the estate in return for a pardon after having murdered a certain John Enhold of Nettlebed . Ockwells was then owned by Sir John 's uncle , Sir Thomas Fettiplace . It passed through the Fettiplace family , before being owned by the Day family .  - White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and 'greenspace' which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism.

The central section and a large portion of the line, between in central London and in the south-east, are due to open in December 2018; at that time the service will be named the Elizabeth line. The western section beyond Paddington, to in Berkshire and Heathrow Airport, is due to enter operation in December 2019, completing the new east-west route across Greater London. Part of the eastern section, between and in Essex, was transferred to a precursor service called TfL Rail in 2015; this section will be connected to the central route through central London to Paddington in May 2019.  - Taplow is a village and civil parish in the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, England. It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design.  - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun.

Article: In April 2014,the world's oldest known message in a bottle was discovered floating in the Baltic Sea. It had spent 101 years lost in the ocean!The message was finally sent to the author's granddaughter. A German fisherman named Konrad Fischer found the brown bottle near Kiel,Germany. He said he nearly threw the bottle back into the water after pulling it out of a fishing net. Then he noticed something inside. The bottle in good condition contained a Danish postcard with two German stamps,dated May 17,1913. Although dampness had made most of the writing illegible ,the readable part of the message asked whoever found it to return it to an address in Berlin. It even contained two stamps to pay for postage. From the address,researchers found that the postcard was written by a man named Richard Platz,who was 20 years old when he wrote the message. While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his. Sure enough,they were able to find his 62-year-old granddaughter,Angela Erdmann,who still lives in Berlin. \\"It was almost unbelievable,\\"Erdmann said upon being presented with her grandfather's bottle and message.\\"That was a pretty moving moment. Tears rolled down my face.\\" Erdmann never knew her grandfather,who died in 1946,but says that the discovery of the bottle has made her want to learn more about him. The bottle remained on display at the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg until May 1.After that,the researchers examined the postcard and tried to figure out the meaning of the rest of the message. Previously,the oldest message found in a bottle spent nearly 98 years at sea and was discovered in April 2012,according to Guinness World Records.

Just like when you don't want anyone peeking while you're playing with your toys, right? So, to know if someone might be a stalker, we can look for some clues: 1. They keep showing up in places you go, even when it's a surprise! It's like playing hide and seek, but they always find you super fast. 2. They send you too many messages, like asking \\"What are you doing?\\" all the time, even when it's not fun anymore. 3. They might try to find out a lot about you, like what you like and don't like, where you live, or where you go to school. That's like someone who keeps asking you questions about your favorite cartoons or snacks, and they don't stop. If you see these clues and you don't feel safe or happy, it's important to tell a grown-up, like your mom, dad, or teacher, to help you.

A:","output":"A: The oldest signer of the Declaration of Independence was Benjamin Franklin. Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, he was 70 years old when the Declaration was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.  Benjamin Franklin was a polymath, who contributed significantly to the fields of science, writing, and politics. Among his many accomplishments, he is best known for his experiments with electricity, his role in drafting the U.S. Constitution, and his influence as a founding father of the United States. His inventions, such as the lightning rod and the bifocals, greatly impacted society at that time and even today. In 1729, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he started a printing business and eventually published the well-known \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" He also founded several civic organizations, such as the Library Company of Philadelphia (America's first lending library) and the American Philosophical Society. He dedicated much of his life to public service, holding multiple positions such as Postmaster General of the colonies and the President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Franklin was an early and passionate advocate for colonial unity and independence. As a member of the Continental Congress, he was among the five individuals (including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston) appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776. From 1776 to 1785, Franklin served as the U.S. envoy to France, where he played a significant role in building French support for the American Revolution. He helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) and the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the war. Upon returning to the U.S., Franklin was elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and played a crucial role in shaping the U.S. Constitution. He took initiative in advancing the procedures of the Great Compromise, which focused on balancing representation between large and small states. Although Benjamin Franklin did not hold formal political office by the end of his life, his influence and contributions as a statesman, scientist, and writer left a lasting impact on the development of the United States. His advanced age during the signing of the Declaration of Independence affirmed his long-standing commitment to the cause of freedom and the birth of a new nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph states that the state attorney general is the chief legal advisor and chief law enforcement officer in each of the 50 U.S. states and territories. Additionally, it mentions that in some states, the attorney general serves as the head of a state department of justice, with responsibilities similar to those of the United States Department of Justice.  However, the paragraph does not provide specific information about the qualifications or capabilities of each attorney general to be the head of the respective department. It is also important to note that the roles and responsibilities of attorney generals can vary from state to state, owing to differences in state laws and regulations. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that attorney generals must be highly knowledgeable and competent in the field of law since they are the chief legal advisors and law enforcement officers in their respective states. Their qualifications and experience are likely to be scrutinized during the appointment or election process.

In an incident that authorities are describing as a stroke of luck, a helicopter pilot has managed to walk away unscathed from a serious crash in Northern California. The accident occurred between San Francisco and Sacramento, with the helicopter going down near Byron Airport, which is situated south of the crash site. The brave pilot, whose identity has not yet been disclosed, is being lauded for his navigational skills, allowing him to land the aircraft in a relatively safe area and avoid further damage or injury. Emergency services were quick to respond to the scene, providing immediate assistance and ensuring that there were no fires or other hazards as a result of the accident. Fire officials, who are coordinating the response to the crash, took the opportunity to emphasize how extremely lucky the pilot is to have survived the accident. \\"Helicopter accidents of this nature typically result in severe injuries or even fatalities. The fact that the pilot was able to walk away is nothing short of miraculous,\\" a spokesperson stated. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing the helicopter descending rapidly, and many feared the worst as they observed the crash. However, those fears were quickly allayed as the pilot was seen safely disembarking from the wreckage. The cause of the helicopter crash is currently under investigation, as authorities seek to ascertain the events leading up to the accident. Officials are expected to closely scrutinize the pilot's actions, as well as the mechanical and structural integrity of the aircraft itself. Byron Airport, a public-use airport located in Contra Costa County near the town of Byron, attracts both general aviation pilots and cargo companies, and has a reputation for safety and professionalism. The management at the airport were quick to express relief that the accident had not resulted in any fatalities or major injuries. The incident comes amidst an overall decline in aviation accidents in the United States. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 2019 saw a significant reduction in the number of fatal general aviation accidents, continuing a downward trend observed over several years. While the outcome of this particular accident was undeniably fortunate, the event serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with aviation in general. Air travel, despite its impressive safety record compared to other modes of transportation, is not without its dangers. As investigators continue to probe the circumstances surrounding this helicopter crash, one fact remains abundantly clear: the pilot's remarkable escape has become a testament to both his skill and the role that luck can sometimes play in the most harrowing situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\".  Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year.  The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.)  The band attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart. Question: Were the songs successfull?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, many of the songs by the Police and Stewart Copeland were successful. The Police became one of the top bands of the 1980s, and their singles like \\"Don't Care\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" entered the UK Singles Chart. They had many popular songs, and Stewart Copeland's solo album, The Rhythmatist, was also the official soundtrack for a movie.

Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Context: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders.

How is \\"We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire.\\" said in French?","output":"In French, the phrase \\"We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire\\" can be translated as: \\"Nous ne souhaiterions pas assumer la responsabilité de l'échec de quelque chose que nous désirons\\".  Breaking down the translation: - \\"We would not like\\" is translated as \\"Nous ne souhaiterions pas\\", where \\"nous\\" refers to \\"we\\", \\"ne...pas\\" is the negation, and \\"souhaiterions\\" is the conditional form of the verb \\"souhaiter\\", meaning \\"to wish\\" or \\"to like\\". - \\"to take responsibility\\" is translated as \\"assumer la responsabilité\\". \\"Assumer\\" means \\"to take\\" or \\"to accept\\" and \\"responsabilité\\" means \\"responsibility\\". - \\"for the failure\\" is translated as \\"de l'échec\\", where \\"de\\" means \\"of\\" or \\"for\\" and \\"l'échec\\" means \\"the failure\\". - \\"of something\\" is translated as \\"de quelque chose\\". \\"Quelque chose\\" means \\"something\\" in French. - \\"that we desire\\" is translated as \\"que nous désirons\\". \\"Que\\" is a relative pronoun that is equivalent to \\"that\\" in this context, \\"nous\\" refers to \\"we\\", and \\"désirons\\" is the present form of the verb \\"désirer\\", meaning \\"to desire\\".

College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder.

We are trying to find the value of 'b' in the equation: 0 = -1885 * b - 14726 - 13549  1. First, let's add 14726 and 13549 together: 14726 + 13549 = 28275 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -1885 * b - 28275 2. Next, let's add 28275 to both sides to isolate the -1885 * b term: 0 + 28275 = -1885 * b - 28275 + 28275 28275 = -1885 * b 3. Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by -1885 to find the value of 'b': 28275 ÷ -1885 = (-1885 * b) ÷ -1885 -15 = b So the answer is b = -15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning. The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb docēre (dɔˈkeːrɛ) 'to teach'. It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first Doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted \`\`Dr'' or \`\`Dr.'', it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree. See options at the end. Can we conclude that is everyone with a phd called a doctor? Choose from: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[II] Yes, typically everyone with a PhD is called a Doctor.

Doctoral degrees are awarded across a wide range of disciplines and fields, including the sciences, humanities, arts, and professional studies. A person who has completed a PhD has demonstrated significant independent research, advanced knowledge, and expertise in a specific area of study, making them eligible for the title. The title \\"Doctor\\" signifies the level of education and achievement acquired. However, it is important to note that in some casual or informal settings, people with PhDs may not be referred to as \\"Doctor.\\" Furthermore, the designation \\"Doctor\\" for medical practitioners, regardless of whether they hold a doctoral-level degree, is more commonly associated with their profession, due to the historical context of the title being used for medical doctors. It is also essential to be aware of any context-specific or cultural norms surrounding the use of academic titles. In some cultures or settings, reference to someone's academic title may not be as important or expected, whereas, in others, it might be a standard part of addressing an individual with such accomplishments.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two questions are essentially paraphrases of each other, as they both aim to understand the reason behind people's self-centered nature. Self-centeredness, also referred to as egocentrism or narcissism, is the tendency to focus on oneself and one's interests, needs, and emotions. People display self-centeredness to varying degrees, and there are numerous factors that contribute to this behavior. Some primary reasons for self-centeredness include: 1. Psychological Factors: - Low self-esteem: Individuals with low self-esteem may become overly self-centered as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from feelings of inadequacy or insecurity. - Lack of empathy: People who lack empathy may have difficulties understanding and appreciating the perspective of others, which may contribute to a self-centered approach to life. - Narcissistic personality disorder: This is a mental health condition characterized by an excessive need for admiration, lack of empathy, and an inflated sense of self-importance. People with narcissistic personality disorder are typically highly self-centered. 2. Social Factors: - Parenting styles: Overindulgent or overly protective parents may inadvertently create self-centered children who grow up believing the world revolves around them. - Cultural norms: In some societies, individualism and personal achievement are highly valued, which can encourage self-centered tendencies. - Social media: The digital age has enabled personalized experiences, where social media platforms allow people to project an idealized version of themselves, sometimes fostering self-absorption. 3. Evolutionary Factors: - Self-preservation: From an evolutionary standpoint, it is advantageous for individuals to prioritize their own needs, ensuring survival and procreation. - Competition: In the context of scarce resources, being self-centered can be beneficial for achieving success, outdoing rivals, and maximizing individual gains. 4. Cognitive Factors: - Egocentrism: During some developmental stages, particularly in early childhood, people tend to believe that their perspective is the only one that matters. Although most people outgrow this phase, some may continue to feel and act as if the world revolves around them. - Confirmation bias: People tend to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs, which could reinforce their tendency to focus on themselves and their experiences. It is crucial to recognize that self-centeredness can exist on a spectrum, and individuals may exhibit these traits to varying extents. In some cases, moderate self-centeredness can be beneficial, enabling individuals to protect their own well-being, set boundaries, and pursue personal goals. However, excessive self-centeredness can damage relationships, hinder collaboration, and result in a lack of social support. Understanding the multifaceted nature of self-centeredness can foster awareness, empathy, and improved communication among individuals."},{"instruction":"Q:A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre.

A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others?

To find a vet that works with frogs, contact local veterinary schools or look online for lists of veterinarians that work with amphibians. For example, you can look at the website of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians.  If there are several vets in your area who work with amphibians, make sure the vet you choose is the one that has the most experience with tree frogs. It's a good idea to find a vet before your frog is actually sick. Having an established relationship with a veterinarian that treats tree frogs will make it easier to get your pet quick care when it needs it. It is best to have your frog checked out by a veterinarian if you see a symptom of illness. While you may end up bringing your pet in for a problem that is non-existent, it is better to be safe than sorry. Some diseases require quick treatment in order to be eliminated. If you suspect that your tree frog is sick but you are unsure about bringing it in to be seen by a vet, at least call the veterinary office and talk to them. Tell them about your pet's symptoms and ask them if they think your frog needs treatment. If your tree frog is indeed ill, your veterinarian will begin its treatment and will give you instructions on how to continue treatment at home. Follow these directions and be sure to continue treatment for as long as your veterinarian suggests, even if your tree frog seems completely healed. If treatment is not minimizing your frog's symptoms or they are getting worse, contact your vet once again. It may be that your frog needs a different type or amount of treatment.

Now, a team of scientists in Sweden has proved that these birds fly for tremendously long periods of time. They affixed data loggers onto a total of 19 of the master fliers in 2013 and 2014, and recaptured the birds months or years later. Researchers found that the birds can spend almost their entire 10-month nonbreeding period on the wing.      The data loggers gathered information on acceleration and flight activity, and those installed in 2014 also included light trackers for geolocation.      The results were astonishing. For example, according to research published in Current Biology, one of the birds stopped for just four nights in February in 2014 — and the next year it stopped for only two hours. Other birds stopped for longer periods of time. But \\"even when swifts settle to roost,\\" the researchers say, \\"the amount of time not flying is very small.\\"      The birds are known to travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa — but they apparently don't touch down there, as National Geographic reports. Researchers say they have never found roosting sites in sub-Saharan Africa.      The scientists say that the rarity of the stops during nonbreeding season suggests that the bird may only take a pause because of bad weather. The fact that some birds fly continuously during nonbreeding periods indicates that the species may not actually need to land for sleep. In fact, it's unclear \\"when and to what extent swifts need to sleep,\\" the paper states.      \\"They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,\\" researcher Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden tells National Geographic. \\"They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can't really land on the ground.\\"      The birds' shape contributes to this finding; their \\"wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface,\\" the magazine reports.      The researchers suggest that one driving force behind the bird's incredibly long flights could be its diet. \\"[S]pecializing in high-altitude aerial insects as a main food source requires the suite of adaptations for efficient flight shown by swifts, ... which compromises terrestrial locomotion and make swifts vulnerable to predators and parasites had they been landing more often,\\" the paper states.      This may remind some eagle-eyed readers of another species with extraordinary flight habits: the frigatebird. As NPR's Christopher Joyce recently reported, those aquatic birds can \\"stay aloft for weeks at a time,\\" and fly to heights thousands of meters above the sea. And in a recent study, \\"one of the tagged birds soared 40 miles without a wing-flap.\\" ||||| Every July, young common swifts leave their European roosts and migrate to western and central Africa. They’ll only be back in the following June, and they’ll spend the intervening 10 months almost continuously in the air. They might travel to Africa, but their feet never meet African soil.      “They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,” says Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden. “They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can’t really land on the ground.” That's because their wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface.      View Images Common swifts soar in Merseyside, England. Photograph by Alan Williams, Nature Picture Library      As a result, common swifts are among nature’s greatest aeronauts, superbly adapted for a life spent largely in the skies.      People have long suspected that swifts stay airborne for long stretches of time, but no one could confirm it. Åkesson and her husband, Anders Hedenström, both from Lund University, did so by fitting 19 of the birds with lightweight data loggers in 2013, and recapturing them one or two years later. The loggers had regularly recorded local light levels, which the duo could use to pinpoint the birds’ global position. And they had recorded the swifts’ acceleration, activity, and body positions, which revealed if they were flying or resting.      The data revealed that some swifts were almost never inactive during their long migrations. For example, between September 2013 and April 2014, one of the birds rested for just four nights in February. The following year, it never rested for a full night; over the same period, it stopped for just two hours.      View Images A common swift (Apus apus) at the Budapest Zoo Photograph by Joel Sartore, National Geographic Photo Ark      A few other swifts did rest more often. Åkesson and Hedenström suspect that this was because they hadn’t finished replacing their wing and tail feathers during their annual molt. The old feathers might have compromised their ability to stay permanently aloft, or their inability to molt fully might reflect some underlying health problem that affected their flight. Either way, it’s not like they were actually grounded. If they rested, it was just for a few hours. At most, they spent just 0.64 percent of their migration on terra firma.      Other scientists have found similar results. In 2013, Felix Liechti from the Swiss Ornithological Institute used similar data loggers to show that three alpine swifts probably flew nonstop for 200 days, on their long migration from Switzerland to Africa and back again. That was especially surprising because alpine swifts are twice the size of common swifts, with wingspans of up to 22 inches.      Such long nonstop flights imply that swifts must be able to sleep while flying. This August, Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany proved that frigate birds—large seabirds with piratical tendencies—do the same. He fitted brainwave sensors to 15 frigatebirds and showed that they sleep mid-flight, for about 40 minutes a day and just a few seconds at a time.      There’s no brain sensor small enough to record their mental activity of a flying swift, but they surely must be taking midair naps too. Maybe they do what dolphins do, sending one half of their brains to sleep at a time so they can stay continuously alert. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A team of scientists from Sweden have proven that the common swift bird has the ability to remain in the air for strikingly long periods of time during their annual migration. Through using data loggers affixed onto the birds, researchers discovered that during their 10-month nonbreeding period, these birds almost entirely remain airborne. Even when they seem to be at rest, the time they spend not flying is minor. These birds travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa without touching the ground. The swifts' long wings and short legs, which hinder take-off from flat surfaces, explain their mostly airborne lifestyle. While it's still unclear to what extent swifts need to sleep, the research suggests that these birds are capable of taking midair naps. Their diet of high-altitude insects could also be driving the extended flight periods. Scientists suggest that their efficient flight prevents them from becoming prey to predators and parasites that would threaten them if they were on the ground more often. These discoveries prove the common swift to be among the nature's greatest aeronauts, living most of their life in flight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the first senator to publicly call on her colleague, Al Franken, to resign after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.      No one in Congress is more associated with the Me Too movement than Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Long before Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer became infamous creeps, Gillibrand was focusing her attention on sexual assault and harassment in the military, on college campuses and in the workplace.      But the two-term senator cemented her prominence in the movement last year when she called out members of her own party. In November, she said that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the following month, she became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct.      Franken announced his resignation the following day.      Speaking out has consequences. Women who come forward about the abuse they’ve faced are often barred from further job opportunities. And even someone in power like Gillibrand who tries to be an advocate for victims can find themselves facing a negative response from a previously friendly community.      Eight women accused Franken of groping them. Yet he remains beloved by many Democrats, who say he was one of the party’s strongest champions on progressive issues. His questioning in Senate hearings landed both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in hot water, and if he were still around, he’d no doubt play a big role in taking on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.      His defenders say he was pushed out too early for transgressions that, while unfortunate, didn’t rise to the level of what some members of the GOP have done and didn’t make him a threat who needed to leave immediately.      Gillibrand wasn’t the only senator to publicly call on Franken to step down, but she was the first (but only by minutes) in a wave of female senators ― who were eventually joined by many of their male colleagues on the same day, Dec. 6 ― to do so. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, reportedly told Franken in private that he needed to go beforehand.      But Gillibrand has received the brunt of the blame for what happened, with many of her detractors saying the reason she came out against Franken was that she’s an “opportunist” who was positioning herself for a presidential run in 2020. Some Democratic Party donors have been reconsidering whether they would support her in a primary.      Most prominently, Gillibrand has attracted the ire of billionaire George Soros, who has long funded Democratic candidates and causes. Soros recently said he wasn’t sure whom he was supporting for 2020, but that it absolutely wouldn’t be Gillibrand. He accused her of going after Franken, “whom I admire,” to “improve her chances” for president.      “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him,” Gillibrand said in a statement to HuffPost. “But I won’t hesitate to always do what I think is right. For nearly a year, we have seen countless acts of courage as women and men have spoken hard truths about sexual assault and sexual harassment and demanded accountability.”      “I stand with them in this new watershed moment of important change in our society on what we deem as acceptable,” she added. “It is clear that we must put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty. When someone does something wrong, you have to speak up and be counted, whether it’s President Trump, or a Democratic colleague.”      ‘I Think It Was A Big Mistake’      HuffPost spoke to dozens of elite donors who contributed significant amounts of money to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Gillibrand, at one time, was part of the tight, loyal Clinton world. The Clintons were early supporters of hers and Hillary wrote the foreword to Gillibrand’s book.      Many of these donors said that either they were unhappy with Gillibrand or knew plenty of people who were. The 2020 race is still years away, but as donors start to shop around, her comments on Clinton and Franken could be a factor.      “I viewed it as self-serving, as opportunistic ― unforgivable in my view,” said Rosalind Fink, a New York donor. “Since then, I have not purposely attended any fundraiser where she was there. And there is absolutely no way I will support her.”      Fink said she condemned Franken’s behavior, but she believed the Senate should have investigated the allegations thoroughly before forcing him out.      “I think it was a big mistake,” said Irene Finel Honigman, another Clinton donor from New York, adding, “I was not that impressed with her to begin with. I think she certainly had potential, but as for many people, this kind of sealed the deal.”      Another donor, who like many others asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly, called Gillibrand a “ruthless opportunist.”      “That’s the knock on her, and that’s what this proved,” he said. “She saw an opportunity to be out front, and regardless of the ramifications, she took it.”      Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic Party donor who has championed female politicians, also said she was reconsidering her support for senators who called for Franken to resign.      On social media, it’s easy to find anti-Gillibrand posts. No matter the issue, Gillibrand has detractors who circle back to what she did to Franken.      Hope Kirsten Gillibrand is happy with her handiwork. https://t.co/vg6Dmpko9B — Bruce Bartlett (@BruceBartlett) July 31, 2018      Because of Al Franken, I will never in a million years vote for Kristen Gillibrand. — Burke Omalley (@burke_omalley) June 17, 2018      So maybe all the women Senators who were so fucking threatened by Al Franken in the Senate need to God Damn find out where the thousand girls are ... like now      Looking at you Gillibrand      https://t.co/PZyveKjept — NTXProgressive (@NTXProgressive) June 17, 2018      There’s also a theory, readily found on social media, that Franken was the target of a right-wing hit job centered around Leeann Tweeden, the first woman to accuse Franken of groping her without her consent, who appears to be conservative-leaning. But besides Tweeden, there were seven other women who said Franken harassed them, and four of them were on the record. Several of the incidents also occurred while he was either in office or running for office.      Part of the reason Franken faced so much pressure to resign was that there was a heated campaign to win the U.S. Senate race in Alabama underway. Franken’s problems were a distraction at a time the party was hammering Republican Roy Moore, who was facing allegations of pursuing teenage girls while he was an adult. The senator resigning without a fight was no doubt, in part, an acknowledgment to the politics of the moment.      Jill Farber Bramson, a Democratic donor and activist in Michigan, said she knew a number of women ― who tended to be older ― who were deeply disappointed when Gillibrand spoke out against Franken.      “They had always really liked Kirsten Gillibrand very much,” she said. “They really respected her. ... They were just devastated that she pushed, they felt, all too hard and all too soon to have him resign.”      ‘Why Are We Making This About Her?’      Gillibrand still has plenty of supporters ― including some former Clinton donors ― and many of them are standing by her even more fiercely since she faced the Franken attacks. They are deeply worried about the damage her principled stand may have done to her political future.      “Why are we blaming Sen. Gillibrand for what Sen. Franken did?” asked Risa Levine, a New York donor who is friends with the senator. “Why are we making this about her? It’s not about her.”      “She’s not the one who put her hand on all those women’s asses and boobs. She didn’t do that,” added another donor. “Why does she have to sacrifice her career, her brand, her authenticity, for the sake of Franken?”      Gillibrand, after all, isn’t a newcomer on the issue of sexual misconduct. In addition to her work on women in the military and on college campuses, she has an organization devoted to promoting women running for office and introduced the Me Too Congress Act in the Senate, legislation devoted to combating sexual harassment in Congress.      In fact, if she hadn’t spoken out, she likely would have lost credibility with her core group of supporters for deciding to suddenly be silent when it came to one of her colleagues. It seemed like no matter what she did, she couldn’t win.      “She’s either a shrew with no power who’s just trying to make a name for herself, or she’s so all-powerful that her saying one thing made a man who has made decisions for himself for 60 years crumble like a cheap suit,” said a Democratic activist, summing up the way Gillibrand has been characterized.      There’s a good chance Gillibrand would have been attacked if she had remained silent on Franken. In Minnesota, a GOP-aligned group sent out a mailer attacking state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the Democratic minority leader in the House, for signing a November statement expressing support for the senator after four women had come forward. Hortman, too, has been outspoken in her support for women’s rights.      HuffPost A mailer by the GOP-aligned group Minnesota Jobs Coalition went after a Minnesota lawmaker for supporting Al Franken.      Gillibrand isn’t the only woman to face a backlash for the Franken resignation. In November, Lindsey Port, then a Democratic candidate for the state legislature, accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of sexual harassment. Schoen resigned, and Port initially received an outpouring of support.      But after Franken announced he was leaving the Senate, the tide turned. Port lost financial support for her campaign and her nonprofit, with some people alleging that she “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation by speaking out about the sexual harassment she faced at the hands of a totally different man. Others even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative.      Many Democrats say they see the split on Gillibrand and Franken as generational, with younger voters ― both men and women ― more likely to support Gillibrand, or at least be sympathetic to what she did.      In June, Gillibrand spoke at the Washington, D.C., chapter of The Wing, an all-female social club that attracts a younger crowd, and she addressed the reason she spoke out on Franken. An attendee said the audience was supportive of her answer and applauded her.      Gillibrand has also had other discussions in the wake of the matter, including calling some other prominent Democratic women in the San Francisco area who are friends with Tompkins Buell. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, the senator reached out to them to explain why she believed Franken needed to go, and she’s been willing to talk about her views with people who are skeptical and have questions.      “Times change, and this is time changing for the better. This is about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Are we for that?” said a Democratic donor. “People just have to get over it. They should expect people to speak up and take a position on it.”      “Did she do it because she wanted to position herself for president? Gee, I’m shocked. People do that all the time. Why is this issue a no-go? Is Bernie [Sanders] taking advantage of single-payer and putting people in an uncomfortable position by being so aggressive about that? We say it’s not the same, but it is the same. It’s getting a different frame because it’s squeezing the old-boy network.” ||||| Nearly a year after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand led the charge in calling for former Sen. Al Franken's resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images 2020 Election Franken scandal haunts Gillibrand’s 2020 chances ‘Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank,’ said one top donor.      Just a month after Al Franken formally resigned from the Senate amid sexual misconduct allegations, the former senator met with an intimate group of Bay Area supporters at the home of major Democratic Party financiers Mary and Steve Swig.      As Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, made the rounds, thanking supporters in the philanthropists’ San Francisco home at the February 2018 event, the conversation broke off into another subject: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York Democrat had, in their opinion, pulled the rug out from under Franken, a Minnesota Democrat beloved by the group, forcing him out without any real vetting of the allegations facing him.      Story Continued Below      “It was said not in front of Al to impress him; it was said privately in a corner. A group of us were standing there talking about it. He was one of our best weapons against this administration, his presence on these committees. [Gillibrand] did the damage that Republicans could not do themselves,” one of the attendees told POLITICO. “There were other people at this event who were saying the same thing. They said, ‘Absolutely, I will never do anything for her.’”      Today, nearly a year after Gillibrand led the charge in calling for Franken’s resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors across the country.      More than a dozen prominent West Coast, New York and national donors and bundlers — many of them women — said they would never again donate to or fundraise for Gillibrand or would do so only if she ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee.

Gillibrand has defended her approach by insisting she placed deeply held personal values over party loyalty.

Among those donors is Susie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and co-founder of Esprit and the North Face clothing brands, who said the matter remains fresh in her mind and among those in her circles. The episode, she said, “stained [Gillibrand’s] reputation as a fair player.”      “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself, and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” she said. “I heard her referred to as ‘She would eat her own,’ and she seems to have demonstrated that. I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this rush to judgment. I have heard [that] some of her women colleagues regret joining her.”      The anger is at least in part a testament to donors’ fondness for Franken, a comedian who rose to fame as a “Saturday Night Live” cast member and remains in the eyes of his supporters one the Senate’s greatest champions for women — even after his resignation. Several of those who talked to POLITICO also spoke of an inner-party struggle to keep Franken from resigning, fearing he was swept up in a panic at the time. A Change.org petition opposing Franken’s resignation had 75,000 signatures. Some blamed the media for rushing to publish allegations without a full vetting.      “I could stay on the phone all afternoon talking about this,” said a Manhattan-based member of the ‘Majority Trust’ of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, an elite group of top donors, who has donated to Gillibrand in the past. “Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank.”      Another major Manhattan-based donor said the episode raised suspicions that it was a craven political move by Gillibrand.      “I thought she was duplicitous,” the donor said. “Once the whole thing happened with Al Franken, it was confirmed 1 billion percent that she’s not to be trusted. I think that she hurt the Democratic Party. I think that she hurt the Senate. I think that what she did for women in politics was dreadful.”      The Franken accusations came in the weeks after a parade of powerful men were toppled by the #MeToo movement; among them Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K. and Garrison Keillor. The wounds over Franken’s ouster were reopened, some Democrats say, during confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual misconduct allegations but still was seated on the Supreme Court.      One major national Democratic fundraiser told POLITICO the level of residual anger runs the gamut, but it’s still very much present.      “I know Kirsten well, and I know Al well. ... It’s tragic what happened to Al, and a lot of my donors feel anywhere from strongly to adamantly about anger at Kirsten for what she did. Others see that it was a way to kind of grab the high ground with no ambiguity,” the fundraiser said. “Personally, I lean towards I think Kirsten overdid it. It’s such a shame that Al couldn’t just go through the process and be reprimanded, or censured. At the moment it happened, it was understandable.”      Gillibrand has stood her ground, never publicly backing down from the criticism, even when it came from the Democratic Party’s most prolific donor, George Soros. In June, he told The Washington Post he blamed Gillibrand for cornering Franken into resigning, accusing her of doing so “in order to improve her chances” in 2020.      In August, Gillibrand responded specifically to Soros, telling HuffPost in a statement : “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.”      Gillibrand’s campaign recently pushed back against the criticism, asserting that the senator did the right thing by speaking up.      “Leadership means standing up for your values when it's hard. Kirsten has never been afraid to stand up for what she believes in and never will be. You can disagree with her views, but holding her accountable for someone else's behavior towards women is wrong, and her values aren't for sale,” Gillibrand spokesperson Glen Caplin said in a statement to POLITICO. “One year later, after the special election in Alabama, the Kavanaugh hearings and the historic number of women who took back the House in the midterms, there is just no case to be made the Democratic Party would have been better off with a different outcome. We have to put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty.”      On Monday, Gillibrand herself sounded off on Twitter. “Silencing women for the powerful, or for your friends, or for convenience, is neither acceptable, nor just,” she wrote above a link to this POLITICO story.      NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said “history will laud” Gillibrand for her actions.      On its face, the revolt against Gillibrand seems counterintuitive. At a key moment in the “#MeToo” movement, Gillibrand stood up to a revered colleague in her own party. She led the call for Franken’s resignation after he was accused of groping or trying to forcibly kiss more than half a dozen women. A chorus of senators quickly followed her. It raised Gillibrand’s national profile, almost immediately branding her as a fierce female leader who told the establishment that when it comes to sexual harassment, “enough is enough.”      It’s unclear whether or to what extent a donor backlash could debilitate Gillibrand’s possible 2020 campaign. In the era of small-donor, digital fundraising, major donors arguably don’t hold as much sway — but that’s typically true only for candidates who catch fire, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Beto O’Rourke.      From 2013 through this year, Gillibrand’s campaign committee raised nearly 18 million for her 2018 reelection bid. Almost 60 percent of that amount came from high-dollar donors, but Gillibrand also raised nearly 6.5 million, or about 30 percent of her total, from small-dollar donors who gave less than 200.      Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy, called Gillibrand’s response “important and courageous.”      “It probably made her more enemies than friends,” said Archila, who famously confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in a congressional elevator this summer during the Kavanaugh hearings.      If Gillibrand is unpopular with a certain subset of the Democratic donor class, it didn’t hurt her in her most recent reelection bid in New York in November, when she won roughly two-thirds of the vote against her Republican opponent and garnered 3.73 million votes — the most for any candidate in New York in this election cycle.      She earned almost 400,000 more votes than Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible 2020 Democratic contender himself. In 2012, when she was running for her first full Senate term, she garnered 350,000 more votes than President Barack Obama, who led the Democratic ticket, received in New York.      Franken, who declined to comment for this story, posted on Facebook over the Thanksgiving holiday thanking supporters for well wishes over the past year — and offered a reflection.      “I’ve also spent a lot of time over this past year thinking about the broader conversation we’ve been having about the experience of women in this country. I know that, for so many people, this issue raises a lot of powerful and painful feelings,” Franken wrote. “This conversation can also be incredibly complicated. I don’t think it’s my place to weigh in on all the debates — but I will continue to listen and learn.”      Carla Marinucci contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a major advocate for the Me Too movement, faces criticisms and potential loss of support from some Democratic Party donors after her calls for the resignation of then-Senator Al Franken (D-Minn) due to multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.

In the equation, there are two terms involving g: -63*g and -6*g. Combine these two terms. -63g - 6g = -69g There are also two constant terms: 880 and -121. Combine these two terms. 880 - 121 = 759 Now the simplified equation is: -69g + 759 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To do this, subtract 759 from both sides of the equation. -69g + 759 - 759 = 0 - 759 -69g = -759. Step 3: Solve for g. To find the value of g, divide both sides of the equation by -69. g = -759 / -69 g ≈ 11 The solution to the equation is g ≈ 11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On one hand , some people might say that without the help of the media , this incident will not occur and thus role models and celebrities do not play any part in instilling values to the people today . Why does the writer feel so negatively about the effect of the media on young people ?","output":"The writer feels negatively about the effect of the media on young people for several reasons, as listed below: 1. Negative influence of celebrities and role models: The writer believes that the statement made by a celebrity or role model has had an adverse impact on the youth, leading them to indulge in promiscuous acts. By referring to this specific incident, the writer demonstrates their belief that celebrities and role models have the power to influence young people's decisions and actions in a detrimental manner. 2. Lack of positive values: By stating that role models and celebrities do not play any part in instilling values in people today, the writer implies that the media's focus is more on sensationalism and entertainment rather than fostering positive values and behavior. This lack of emphasis on teaching values can contribute to young people making wrong decisions, as they are not receiving positive guidance from the people they look up to. 3. Amplification of negative incidents: The writer believes that the media plays a considerable role in amplifying the negative incidents involving celebrities and role models. By providing extensive coverage of such incidents, the media inadvertently promotes and reinforces undesirable behavior, making it more likely for young people to follow them. 4. Absence of personal responsibility: The writer suggests that young people are using the media's portrayal of celebrities as an excuse for their actions, rather than taking personal responsibility for their behaviors and choices. This situation demonstrates that young people are heavily reliant on the media for guidance, further reinforcing the negative impact of the media on young people's lives. 5. The power of social reinforcement: The article implies that the media not only influences young people individually but also contributes to a collective mindset. This social reinforcement of negative behaviors makes it more challenging for young people to resist these influences, as they might feel pressured to conform to the behaviors widely accepted by their peers. In summary, the writer feels negatively about the effect of the media on young people because they believe that the media plays a significant role in promoting undesirable behaviors and attitudes among the youth. Instead of instilling positive values and providing constructive guidance, the media's portrayal of celebrities and role models contributes to a culture that amplifies negative incidents and fosters a climate of irresponsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - injury - beauty - late - mistakes - annoyed  Explain why a human would choose \\"late\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"late\\" as the answer to the question above because it most accurately reflects the potential consequences of a grooming appointment taking longer than expected. The other options, while they may be relevant in some situations, do not directly address the impact on the next appointment. Let's analyze them one by one: 1. Injury: While it's possible that an injury could occur during a grooming session, it wouldn't be the natural consequence for the next appointment if the current grooming appointment runs late. The injury would primarily concern the individual involved and the groomer. 2. Beauty: Beauty could be a positive outcome of an excellent grooming session, but it doesn't address the effect on the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than planned. 3. Late: When a grooming appointment runs longer than expected, it can cause a domino effect on the other scheduled appointments. As a result, the next appointment would likely be delayed, causing the clients to experience a late start to their sessions. Furthermore, this can lead to a backlog throughout the day with each subsequent appointment starting later than anticipated. 4. Mistakes: While mistakes can happen during a grooming session, they don't inherently cause the next appointment to be affected. If mistakes were made in the current appointment, the groomer would likely need to address and fix the issues on hand. However, mistakes don't necessarily lead to an extension in appointment duration, and even if they do, it doesn't directly connect to the effect on the next appointment. 5. Annoyed: Clients might become annoyed if their appointment is delayed or if they have to wait for an extended period. This emotional response might be a consequence of the next appointment being late, but it doesn't thoroughly explain the direct impact on the appointment scheduling. Therefore, a human would choose \\"late\\" as the most logical and fitting answer, as it directly correlates with the consequences of the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than expected. A late appointment can lead to a variety of issues, such as dissatisfaction among clients, inefficiency in the grooming service, and potential loss of clientele due to chronic lateness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014, joined again by Godrich. In 2015 they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich's father, and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. In the same year, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to The Panic Office, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia, and Junun, a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson. On Christmas Day 2015, Radiohead released a new song, \\"Spectre\\", on the audio streaming site SoundCloud. It had been commissioned for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre, but was rejected by the film producers as \\"too dark\\".Radiohead's ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released in May 2016 on Radiohead's website and online music stores, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles \\"Burn the Witch\\" and \\"Daydreaming\\", the latter directed by Anderson. The album includes several songs written years earlier, including \\"True Love Waits\\", and strings and choral vocals arranged by Jonny Greenwood and performed the London Contemporary Orchestra. It was Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in the award's history, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for \\"Burn the Witch\\") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Article: While drunken driving may be on the decline, traffic safety experts remain puzzled over how to deal with another alcohol related danger: drunken pedestrains. Pedestrians struck and killed by cars often are extremely drunk. In fact, they are intoxicated  more frequently and with higher blood alcohol levels than drunken drivers who are killed in accidents, various studies have shown. Forty percent of adult pedestrians involved in fatal crashes have a blood alcohol level of at least 0.10 which by law in most states signifies intoxication compared to only 25 percent of drivers in deadly accidents, according to recent federal data. Some types of pedestrain accidents have been declining nationally, especially those involving children, but the number of adult pedestrians who are drunk when killed in traffic has remained  ly steady at 2500 a year. The total number of pedestrians killed annually in U.S. traffic accidents is at least 7000, or one of every seven highway accidents resulting in death. \\"We're dealing here, we think, with a very severe drinking problem that leads to a severe highway safety problem,\\" said Richard Blomberg, president of Dunlap and Associates Inc, in Norwalk, Coon. w.w.^w.k.&s.5*u.c.#om.... Blomberg, whose consulting company found a very high rate of alcohol involvement in a controlled study of pedestrian accidents in New Orleans, was among several researchers who spoke on the topic at the annual meeting of the Research council's Transportation Research Board(TRB)  in Washington in January. Pedestrian accidents have not received enough attention in the past, according to Kay Colpitts, who chairs the board's committee on pedestrians. Few methods exist to monitor walking habits, she said, and researchers have been mystified about how to prevent disasters.

Emily knew how to cook many different recipes but Jessica did not, so","output":"Emily decided that it was time to take Jessica under her wing and teach her the art of cooking. The two friends had always bonded over their mutual love for food, so Emily thought there was no better way to spend quality time together and help Jessica expand her culinary skills. To begin with, Emily organized a cooking class at her home once a week. She made sure to buy all the ingredients beforehand and chose a variety of simple recipes that Jessica could easily follow. From homemade pasta and sauces, to fresh salads and soups, Emily ensured that each class covered a different type of dish to keep Jessica engaged and excited to learn. At their first cooking class, Emily taught Jessica the basic techniques of chopping and sautéing ingredients while they made stir-fry. Emily emphasized the importance of using proper knife skills and being mindful of heat control. Jessica was a quick learner, and Emily could see her confidence grow as the weeks went on. As Jessica's knowledge expanded, so did her appreciation for the diversity of flavors and textures in various dishes. Emily introduced her to a wide array of seasonings and taught her how to balance the flavors in each meal. Jessica found herself more and more intrigued by world cuisine and even suggested they try making a Thai coconut curry one week, much to Emily's approval. Over time, the two friends delved deeper into their culinary exploration, gradually learning about the complexities of various ingredients and techniques they could use to elevate their dishes. From homemade bread and sauces to mastering the art of perfectly cooking different types of protein, Jessica's understanding and appreciation of food grew exponentially. Their weekly cooking sessions became more than just an educational experience; it evolved into an opportunity for them to catch up and bond over their shared love of food. The friendly atmosphere, combined with the satisfaction of learning new dishes, created the perfect environment to nurture their friendship and strengthen their bond. With each class, Jessica grew more comfortable in the kitchen. She even started to experiment with recipes on her own, tailoring them to her personal taste and adding her own unique twists. Emily was consistently impressed by Jessica's progress and found joy in watching her friend find so much enthusiasm and excitement in cooking. What started out as a simple gesture between friends soon transformed into a rich and rewarding learning experience that brought them even closer than before. Not only did Jessica learn the art of cooking, but the time invested in the process helped forge a stronger bond between them. Their shared love for food transcended the act of cooking and allowed them to create cherished memories that would last a lifetime. As they continued on their culinary journey, Emily and Jessica discovered new recipes together and experimented with new combinations of flavors and ingredients.

What is the best way to: To create an easy heating pad for your period, Options are: (1). put some rice into a bowl and microwave it. (2). put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Answer:","output":"The best way to create an easy heating pad for your period is Option 2: put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Step 1: Select a clean, microwave-safe fabric sack or a small cloth bag that will comfortably fit the desired amount of rice. This bag will be used as the heating pad, so it should be soft and comfortable when placed against the skin. Step 2: Fill the sack with uncooked rice, leaving enough space for the rice to move around and distribute evenly within the bag. You can also add a few drops of essential oils like lavender for added relaxation, if desired. Step 3: Seal the sack properly, ensuring that no rice can spill out. This is important for microwave safety and cleanliness. Step 4: Microwave the rice-filled sack on a microwave-safe plate. Start with a low power setting and warm the bag for about one minute. Check the temperature of the bag carefully to avoid burns and overheating. If it is not warm enough, continue microwaving in 15-30 second increments, checking the temperature after each interval until it reaches the desired warmth. Step 5: Place the warm rice heating pad on the affected area to alleviate period pain and discomfort. Option 2 is better than Option 1 because microwaving rice in a bowl can lead to uneven heating, spillage, and difficulty in applying the rice directly to the affected area. Using a sack provides a more convenient and safer way to create a heating pad. Additionally, the rice-filled sack can be reused multiple times, making it an efficient and eco-friendly choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

Comprehensive schools are a type of educational institution that emerged as a response to the selective nature of traditional schools, especially in countries like the United Kingdom. Comprehensive schools aim to provide an inclusive and accessible education for all students, irrespective of their social background, abilities, or future aspirations. The primary features and goals of these schools can be understood in terms of the following aspects: 1. Inclusivity: One of the core principles of comprehensive schools is to be inclusive and break down barriers between students from different social, economic, and educational backgrounds. This commitment to inclusivity and social cohesion is evident in their diverse student populations, which contributes to a shared learning environment that promotes understanding and cooperation between students of all backgrounds. 2. Non-selective admission: Comprehensive schools follow a non-selective admission policy, meaning that they admit students based on their residential area rather than any particular academic or intellectual criteria. This is in contrast to selective educational institutions like grammar schools, which require passing entrance exams to be admitted. This ensures that every student has equal opportunity to access high-quality education, without being subject to entrance examinations or barriers. 3. Broad Curriculum: Comprehensive schools are designed to cater to a wide range of skills, interests, and abilities among their student body. To achieve this, the schools offer a broad curriculum that includes a range of academic, vocational, and extracurricular subjects. This allows students to explore their strengths and interests and ensures that they have the flexibility to develop various skills, which is essential for personal and professional development. 4. Mixed-ability teaching: A significant aspect of comprehensive schools is their approach to mixed-ability teaching. Students are not segregated based on their academic ability but are instead taught in the same classrooms. This helps prevent the development of a divide between high-achieving students and others and fosters an environment of support and collaboration. 5. Personalized learning: Recognizing that students may have different learning needs, comprehensive schools strive to provide personalized learning experiences for their students. This includes providing targeted support and resources for those who require them, as well as ensuring that teaching methods and resources accommodate various learning styles and preferences. 6. Career guidance and support: Comprehensive schools recognize the importance of preparing students for their future careers and provide a range of services to achieve this goal. This includes offering career guidance and counseling services, as well as connecting students with internship, volunteering, and job opportunities. Overall, comprehensive schools aim to equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. 7. Community integration: Comprehensive schools often act as community hubs, fostering connections between the school, parents, and the wider community. By organizing and participating in various community events, projects, and initiatives, comprehensive schools aim to promote a sense of belonging and shared responsibility among all stakeholders. In conclusion, the primary features and goals of comprehensive schools center around promoting inclusivity, delivering a broad curriculum, fostering mixed-ability teaching, and providing personalized learning experiences, career guidance, and community integration. Through these features, comprehensive schools strive to offer a well-rounded and accessible education that caters to every student's unique needs and interests."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Rabindranath Tagore FRAS ( ( listen); Bengali: [robindronath thakur]), also written Ravindranatha Thakura (7 May 1861 - 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \\"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\\", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \\"elegant prose and magical poetry\\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Context: Dutta and Robinson describe this phase of Tagore's life as being one of a \\"peripatetic litterateur\\". It affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that \\"Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ...\\" Tagore confided in his diary: \\"I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity.\\" To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy--and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic karma, as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious implications. He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal, and detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed Satyajit Ray's film Apur Sansar. Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works Punashcha (1932), Shes Saptak (1935), and Patraput (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas-- Chitra (1914), Shyama (1939), and Chandalika (1938)-- and in his novels-- Dui Bon (1933), Malancha (1934), and Char Adhyay (1934).  Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in Visva-Parichay, a 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude. He wove the process of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in Se (1937), Tin Sangi (1940), and Galpasalpa (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest. A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in. The date is still mourned. A. K. Sen, brother of the first chief election commissioner, received dictation from Tagore on 30 July 1941, a day prior to a scheduled operation: his last poem.  I'm lost in the middle of my birthday. I want my friends, their touch, with the earth's last love. I will take life's final offering, I will take the human's last blessing. Today my sack is empty. I have given completely whatever I had to give. In return if I receive anything--some love, some forgiveness--then I will take it with me when I step on the boat that crosses to the festival of the wordless end. Question: Did he eventually die? Answer:","output":"Yes, Rabindranath Tagore eventually passed away. He experienced chronic pain and illness in the last years of his life. Tagore died on August 7, 1941, at the age of 80, in the Jorasanko mansion where he grew up."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Tuxeck -  The Tuxeck (or Tuxegg) is a 2226 m AA high mountain in the Kaisergebirge range in the Austrian state of Tyrol.

It is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 70-80 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom live in Turkey. Turkish is part of the larger Altaic linguistic group, alongside languages like Mongolian, Korean, and Tungusic (it's should be noted, however, that the classification of Turkish as Altaic is somewhat controversial in academic circles). Turkish evolved from a language known as Proto-Turkic, which was spoken in northeast Mongolia around the first millennium B.C. The Turkish language underwent several significant reforms in the 20th century that drastically transformed its lexicon, syntax, and morphology. Most famous among these reforms was a 1928 decree which switched the writing system from the Perso-Arabic script to the Latin script. The language has uniform pronunciation, with vowels and consonants pronounced with no alterations throughout the sentence. Turkish is agglutinative, meaning that it frequently uses suffixes, and it follows a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure. The excerpt you've provided \\"Mesele, anayasa ve Ohrid Anlaşması'nda bu şekilde yer aliyor ve bu anlaşma, ülkedeki siyasi partiler ve uluslararası toplumun temsilcileri tarafından da imzalanmıştır\\" when translated into English says: \\"The matter is stated in this way in the constitution and the Ohrid Agreement, and this agreement has also been signed by the political parties in the country and representatives of the international community.\\"  Turkish is also known for its honorific system, which distinguishes between formal and informal ways of addressing people and often shows respect to age, social status, and professional rank.

Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick \\"Mac\\" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

Hypothesis: The Hubble Space Telescope's success was praised recently in a Newsweek cover story. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise provided states that Newsweek's cover story celebrates the success of the Hubble Space Telescope. This directly implies that the hypothesis stating the Hubble Space Telescope's success was indeed praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. To further analyze and break down the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, let's look at the key aspects of both statements: 1. The central subject of both the premise and the hypothesis is the Hubble Space Telescope. This telescope is a major scientific instrument that has significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe by capturing high-resolution images of celestial objects and allowing researchers to peer deep into space and time. The fact that both statements are centered on this subject helps establish a clear connection between them. 2. The premise highlights that Newsweek, a well-known publication with a wide readership, has chosen to feature the Hubble Space Telescope on its cover. This choice reflects the significance and impact of the telescope's success in the world of science and astronomy. The hypothesis also specifically mentions Newsweek, further reinforcing the connection with the premise. 3. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention that the Hubble Space Telescope's success is the focal point of the cover story. This shared focus clearly links the two statements, as they both emphasize the remarkable achievements of the telescope. 4. Lastly, the premise explicitly states that the cover story \\"hails the success\\" of the Hubble Space Telescope. This celebratory tone can be seen as an endorsement or praise for the telescope and its accomplishments. This concept of praise aligns with the hypothesis, which mentions \\"praised recently\\" to describe the content of the cover story. In conclusion, the premise – asserting that Newsweek's cover story hails the success of the Hubble Space Telescope – entails the hypothesis which claims that the telescope's success was praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. Both statements are centered around the Hubble Space Telescope and its success, and they both highlight the recognition and praise given by Newsweek through its cover story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone uses the internet nowadays, don't they? Well, no. Not everyone. Earlier this year the Office for National Statistics reported that almost nine out of 10 adults in the UK (44.7 million people) have used the internet in the last three months. That's a lot. But it means there are still 5.9 million people (11% of the UK's adult population) who never go online. So, who are these people? Why are they not using the internet? And are they really any worse off? Unsurprisingly, most of those who spend their entire lives offline are older. Almost everyone aged between 18 and 54 are recent users of the internet, the ONS report found. But that figure falls away dramatically in the older generation, and amongst the over 75s just a third could be described as \\"silver surfers\\". The geographical spread of internet users is also hardly surprising: in London and the south-east of England almost 90% of the population are connected to the world wide web. In Scotland, 85.4% of people are online; in Wales, 82.5% and in Northern Ireland fewer than eight in 10 (79.6%) people have used the internet in the last three months. Less reliable figures from the ONS suggest that one in five people in Dumfries and Galloway are not connected. A poor broadband service in parts of the region is partly to blame for the situation but work is ongoing to bring so-called \\"superfast broadband\\" to region. James Pocock is responsible for improving digital connectivity in Dumfries and Galloway. As the council's Next Generation Broadband manager, he is the local link with Digital Scotland, a partnership of public, private and voluntary groups which promotes the digital technology. He is aiming to meet an ambitious Scotland-wide target to have 95% of homes and businesses connected to superfast broadband by the end of 2017, but he admitted that the south of Scotland has suffered from poor infrastructure in the past and there are challenges ahead. \\"What has been completed to date could be regarded as the easier infrastructure to deliver and we are now looking at how we can push that infrastructure out to harder to reach areas,\\" he said. \\"That will be more challenging and more time consuming.\\" But it is a vital resource for the area, he said. \\"So much of what we do everyday is either done or supported by online activity. Whether that is learning, purchasing services, it's just part of everyday life in a modern economy that we live in nowadays.\\" Janice Rutherford, a grandmother from Cumnock, has no interest in using the internet. Her grown up children have tried to convince her that she could save money by shopping and paying her bills online, but she is not so sure. \\"I know all these things happen but that's for other people. It's not for me,\\" she said. Even if she was given a free computer and unlimited, free internet access, she said she still could not be persuaded. Would anything persuade her to get online, to get her own Facebook page? \\"No, especially not a Facebook page,\\" she said. \\"There's too much going on on Facebook that I don't like, especially when other people put me on it.\\" People on low incomes, those with disabilities and older people are among those who are least likely to use the internet, according to Sue Irving, chief executive of the Dumfries and Galloway Citizens Advice Service. And it can be a huge stumbling block for jobseekers and those applying for Universal Credit, which can only be applied for online. Ms Irvine said: \\"There's a push to move benefit applications online so if you are not computer literate, you don't have access to a computer, you don't have broadband, then it's really difficult for people.\\" Without the purchasing power internet shopping offers, it can also hit the poor and vulnerable in the pocket, she said. \\"We produced a report about the cost of living in the region and what we were seeing was... that if people aren't able to have the purchasing power that you have on line, then there's a disadvantage to that as well. \\"If your local shops have high prices and you don't have transport, you have a disability or a young family, then you are not able to be savvy in how you shop because you're not able to use the online facilities,\\" she added. Many libraries in Scotland offer basic computer literacy courses, and they are listed on the Let's Get On website. However until 100% of the population are digitally literate, Ms Irvine called for \\"flexibility\\" and \\"understanding\\" from the government. \\"It might sound efficient to say put everything online, and for some people that would probably work very well, but for a lot of people it doesn't,\\" she said. \\"It's about understanding at government level and at local government level that not everybody is computer literate, not everybody has access.\\" She added: \\"We would like there to be a flexible approach to that so for those who want to stick with paper systems, they should be able to do that.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the digital divide in the United Kingdom, focusing on the reasons why some individuals do not use the internet.

Parapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't.

Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the establishment of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As I Lay Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums. As I Lay Dying's fourth studio album An Ocean Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.  Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\"  However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general: Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\".  While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis \\"has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God.\\"  In 2014 Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists. Former guitarist Nick Hipa calls these claims slanderous and defamatory. Did they mention about his wife?","output":"Yes, they mentioned Tim Lambesis' wife, Meggan.

Possible answers:  1). yes;  2). no;","output":"2). No. The statement provided is indeed incorrect. In 1997, Canada did not issue the special £1 banknote from the Royal Bank of Scotland to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell. It was the Royal Bank of Scotland who released the £1 commemorative note in honor of Bell, a Scottish-born inventor and scientist. Now, let me provide you with the correct information related to Canadian currency in 1997. To celebrate Bell, Canada did not release a form of currency specifically in 1997. However, in 2002, the Bank of Canada honored the inventor by featuring Alexander Graham Bell on the back of the Canadian 100 banknote (issued as part of the Canadian Journey Series). The banknote depicted Bell with his numerous inventions, such as the telephone, photophone, HD-4 hydrofoil, and the Silver Dart airplane, commemorating his significant contributions to the development of communication and transportation technology. In conclusion, the correct information related to Bell and Canadian currency is that in 2002, the Bank of Canada released a 100 banknote featuring Alexander Graham Bell and his inventions. The 1997 Royal Bank of Scotland £1 commemorative note is not related to Canadian currency but instead was issued by Scotland to celebrate Bell's 150th birth anniversary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Senussi defeats in the Coastal Campaign forced the survivors over the border into Libya and to prevent a revival, the light Fords and armoured cars continued their patrols. The Aulad Ali surrendered to Peyton, having also gone hungry in the famine and public unrest in Alexandria diminished. The South African Brigade returned to Alexandria and two battalions of the Composite Brigade, a company of the Camel Corps, two guns of the Hong Kong Battery, the light armoured cars and the reconnaissance aircraft remained in Sollum, with an RFC half-flight. On 7 April, four light armoured cars and a machine-gun section of the 2/7th Middlesex left Sollum to raid an ammunition dump at Moraisa, 18 mi  to the north-west and destroyed artillery ammunition and about 120,000 rounds of small-arms ammunition; other patrols that month uncovered another 167,000 rounds. The Italian army posted two battalions at Bardia to co-operate and from 25-26 July, a raiding force from Sollum and Italian cars from Bardia, a party from the Camel Corps and an Italian yacht, Misurat attacked a party of about forty Muhafizia at Wadi Sanal in Libya, 40 mi  west of Ras el Mehl. The party was scattered and served as a warning that there was no sanctuary on either side of the border. Patrols continued for the year and a camel convoy was captured near Jaghbub, a Senussi stronghold 135 mi  from Sollum; more combined Italian-British raids were made during the winter.

Please answer the following question: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification.  Which farm produces less milk with no antibiotics?  Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, Vole farm, which grows organic produce and produces organic milk, would be the farm that produces less milk with no antibiotics.  Since organic farming practices restrict the use of antibiotics and chemicals, Vole farm's organic production method ensures that their milk has no chemical residues, and the likelihood of antibiotic-resistant pathogens being present is lower. While both dairy cows in organic and conventional farming practices may be exposed to pathogens, the limitations on antibiotics use in organic practices reduce the chances of developing antibiotic resistance, thus making antibiotics more effective when necessary.

She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

Emma Reynolds. PUBLISHED:. 06:44 EST, 12 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 21:02 EST, 12 June 2012. The world's youngest gastric sleeve patient claims having risky weightloss surgery at 12 years old transformed her life. Betsy Sanchez, from Coahuila in Mexico, is delighted to have slimmed down from 15 to ten stone since having 70 per cent of her stomach removed. Having now taken up exercise for the first time, 14-year-old Betsy is no longer a target for cruel bullies who teased her about her size. Radical change: Betsy Sanchez before the weightloss surgery, left, and after shedding five stone, right. Active lifestyle: Betsy, who was morbidly obese at 15st, is now 10st and enjoys horse-riding and spending time with friends. The change took place thanks to the her uncle, Dr Guillermo Alvarez, a bariatric surgeon who carries out the controversial permanent weightloss operations on adolescents. Betsy's mother Ana, the doctor's second cousin, says that taking the drastic step was the only way to stop her daughter following the. same heartbreaking path as Georgia Davis, the 19-year-old British girl whose food. addiction caused her to balloon to 63st. 'Diet and exercise didn't work for Betsy - she was addicted to food, only surgery would work,' said 39-year-old Mrs Sanchez. 'If Georgia had an operation at 12, she'd be happy and healthy now. She's lost years of her life. She might be too big now to safely have the operation - which proves it's sometimes better to have it young.' Food obsessed: Betsy, pictured with her mother Ana, struggled with her weight from the age of four. Controversial procedure: Betsy's surgery was carried out by her uncle Dr Guillermo Alvarez, left. Dr Alzarez says having surgery is. helpful for children who are struggling to lose weight because having a. much smaller stomach restricts their food intake. He. claims the surgery not only benefits a child's health - helping prevent. medical issues such as diabetes and liver disease - but improves their. confidence and allows for a more active childhood and happier school. life. Dr Alvarez, who. receives patients from across the USA, Britain and Europe, has since. operated on other children, but sets a lower age limit of 12. Betsy said: 'When my uncle said he could make me thinner I was so excited. I can still eat whatever I want but smaller portions. 'I can have McDonald's, but much smaller portions, only two chicken nuggets and chips. 'Out of control': Betsy at five and seven. The little girl weighed four stone by three years old and was 'always hungry', according to her family. 'I'm much happier. I now go horse-riding and I have lots of friends.' Betsy's weight problems began at the age of three when she started asking for extra portions and demanding snacks between meals, causing her weight to soar to four stone. A gastric sleeve is one of the newer types of weightloss operations. The stomach is permanently reduced to about 25 per cent of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach. The open edges are then attached together (often with surgical staples) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape. It may be appropriate for people who can't return as often for the follow-up visits required by gastric band procedures. A gastric band is a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar that is fitted around the upper stomach to restrict food intake, creating a small pouch and a narrow passage to the lower stomach. This passage delays the emptying of food from the pouch and causes a feeling of fullness. The band can be tightened or loosened over time. Mrs Sanchez admitted she and her furniture dealer husband Guillermo, 44, kept treats in the house for their two other children, aged 13 and nine. She said: 'Betsy would have four cookies and four crackers between meals. If I tried to stop her, she'd have a tantrum. She was always hungry. 'I tried serving healthy food and cutting portions, but Betsy was out of control.' Betsy's parents took her to see a paediatrician and she was tested for an underactive thyroid, but no medical reason was found for her weight issues. Nutritionists and psychologists also failed to find a solution. The 14-year-old said: 'When I asked mum for seconds she gave in. I used to comfort eat because I was bullied.' By the age of seven, Betsy was eating. up to 3,000 calories a day - double the recommended intake for her age -. and by the time she was nine she was a size 20 and weighed 13st. She. added: 'My parents took me to see lots of doctors and nutritionists but. nothing helped me lose weight. I was worried I was going to get so fat. I'd end up bedridden.' At. 12, Betsy weighed 15st and had a BMI of 41, making her morbidly obese. Her parents took her to see Dr Alvarez, Mrs Sanchez's second cousin,. anxious that Betsy might be suffering from depression and could develop. medical issues such as diabetes and high cholesterol. Dr. Alvarez explained all young patients undergo a psychological evaluation. to ensure they understand the implications of weightloss surgery. They. are put on a nutrition and exercise program which continues after the. operation. Demanding child: Betsy, pictured aged seven and eight, would have tantrums if she was not allowed second helpings and snacks. Happy teenager: Betsy admits she used to comfort eat because she felt miserable about her weight. Confident: Betsy has gone from 15st to 10st and enjoys activities such as horse-riding for the first time. He eventually operated on Betsy in 2008, after studies showed the benefit of surgery on young people. Betsy is believed to be the youngest patient ever to undergo the gastric sleeve. 'It is very controversial to operate on children,' said Dr Alvarez. 'But I see the benefits of helping children in cases where parents have tried everything but nothing else seems to control their eating problem. 'It has changed Betsy's life. She now goes to a new school where no-one even knows she used to be overweight.' Mrs Sanchez added: 'Betsy is like a different girl. She is still shy, but she is blossoming into a beautiful young woman, making friends, and enjoying her teenage years. 'I think surgery is definitely worth considering in some cases for children like her.'","output":"1.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow?, using the article: Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in..., what would be the answer ?

They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit.  But I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit.

Knowing that \\"a plant cell contains chloroplasts\\", how would one answer \\"Cactus house a great amount of\\"","output":"Cactus house a great amount of specialized cells called parenchyma cells, which have unique adaptations and properties that help the plant survive in its arid and harsh environment. Among these cells, one of the most noteworthy characteristics is the high density of chloroplasts found within them, enabling the cactus to efficiently carry out photosynthesis and convert sunlight into energy. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants, as it allows them to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for this process, and therefore, they play a pivotal role in the plant's overall survival and growth. In the case of cacti, these plants have evolved to live in environments with limited water and extreme temperatures, so their cells must be highly specialized to maximize their energy production and storage, while minimizing water loss. The chloroplasts contained within the parenchyma cells of a cactus are a key adaptation that enables this plant to survive in such conditions. Here are some of the ways in which the chloroplasts contribute to the cactus' unique survival strategies: 1. Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) Photosynthesis: One significant adaptation found in cacti is their ability to undergo a specialized form of photosynthesis called CAM. This process allows the plants to open their stomata (pores on the leaf surface) at night to absorb carbon dioxide while keeping them closed during the day to minimize water loss through transpiration. The chloroplasts in the cactus' parenchyma cells play an essential role in this process by storing the carbon dioxide as malate, a four-carbon compound, which is later used for the production of glucose during the day. 2. High chloroplast density: The parenchyma cells in cacti contain a higher density of chloroplasts than many other plants. This allows them to carry out photosynthesis more efficiently and maximize the amount of energy harvested from sunlight. In addition, the arrangement of the chloroplasts within the cells optimizes their exposure to light by positioning them close to the cell walls. 3. Storage of water and nutrients: The parenchyma cells in cacti are particularly large and are capable of storing significant amounts of water and nutrients. This, along with their large central vacuole, enables the plant to survive long periods of drought and extreme temperatures. The chloroplasts within these cells contribute to the production of energy and the synthesis of essential nutrients, such as sugars, proteins, and other organic compounds necessary for the plant's survival. In conclusion, cacti house a great amount of specialized parenchyma cells containing a high density of chloroplasts. These chloroplasts play a central role in the plant's adaptations specific to arid and extreme environments. They facilitate the unique photosynthetic processes, including the highly efficient CAM photosynthesis, providing the cactus with the energy and nutrients necessary to thrive in its harsh surroundings."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Gas Laws and Air Composition Gas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In natural systems, gases are normally present as a mixture of different types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (Figure 22.21). Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture. Dalton’s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a gaseous mixture and states that a specific gas type in a mixture exerts its own pressure; thus, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.

Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because  OPTIONS: -Neil was at fault.. -Derrick was at fault..","output":"Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because Neil was at fault. That cloudy Saturday afternoon, Neil and Derrick had been returning from a local basketball match. As always, they were both fully absorbed in discussing the game's highlights, dissecting each play and celebrating their team's victory.  Neil was the driver, and Derrick the designated copilot. Due to their intense conversation, Neil didn't notice the sharp turn until it was too late. In an attempt to prevent their car from dipping into the adjacent ditch, he instinctively jerked the steering wheel too hard, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The car drifted off the road, scraping against the thick, unforgiving branches of the dense hedgerows that lined the route. They were both mostly unharmed but shaken by the incident. They had been fortunate that there was nobody else on the road at the time, but the impact of the car with the hedgerow had left significant damage, the scratches and dents on the car's bodywork attesting to the vehemence of the crash. After assessing the extent of the damage, Derrick had suggested that they split the cost of the repairs. But Neil couldn't bear the thought of burdening his friend with additional expenses, especially since it was he who'd been behind the wheel. He tried to argue his case, insisting on taking full responsibility for the accident and bearing the brunt of the costs. \\"I was the one driving, Derrick. Really, I should be the one to pay. If I had paid closer attention to the road, we wouldn't be caught in this situation,\\" Neil explained, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment.  Derrick, however, refused to give in. \\"Man, come on! We were both at fault here,\\" he argued, clapping Neil on the back in a rare, vulnerable display of camaraderie. \\"You wouldn't be so distracted if I hadn't been yammering on about the game the whole way. It's only fair that I help out with the expenses.\\" The two friends stood by the side of the road for a good while, each stubborn in their stance and neither one willing to let the other shoulder the blame entirely. Their voices rose and fell, ricocheting between frustration and dogged determination, as their breaths formed misty clouds in the cold air around them. Realizing that standing by their mangled vehicle wouldn't resolve the matter, Neil suggested they call a tow truck and head back to their shared apartment. But the conversation would continue intermittently for the next couple of days, each time the subject of the damaged car came up. Determined to hold himself accountable, Neil took it upon himself to do the research, seeking out the best local workshop to have the car repaired, and spend time comparing quotes in order to settle on the most affordable and reputable option. One evening later that week, Derrick approached Neil after dinner, seeming more solemn than usual. \\"Look, bud,\\" he said softly, \\"I know you want to do right by me, but the car was ours to begin with. We're a team, Neil, and we share everything – good and bad. So, why don't we just flip a coin and let fate decide who pays for it? That way, it's out of our hands.\\" Neil looked at his friend, contemplating his words, then finally conceded with a nod. \\"Alright, Derrick. Let's do it your way. Heads, I pay; tails, you pay,\\" he said, drawing a deep breath. Derrick produced a worn, silver coin from his pocket and flipped it. As it spun through the air, Neil knew that whatever the result, their friendship would remain strong; after all, they were a team, and that meant sticking together through triumph and adversity alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss.

He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

While the review is quite short and doesn't provide a comprehensive perspective, the use of the word \\"fresh\\" implies that the critic found the movie to be new, invigorating, and potentially different from other movies they have watched. The term \\"fresh\\" often carries positive connotations when used in a movie review, suggesting that the movie managed to deliver a sense of originality, creativity, or innovation in its story, characters, or overall execution. It may also hint at the film's ability to engage and entertain, or even surprise and challenge the audience in unexpected ways. However, without a longer and more detailed review, it's difficult to grasp the full extent of the critic's opinion about the movie. A comprehensive review would typically address specific elements like the plot, characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, music, and the movie's overall impact on the viewer. By discussing these aspects in detail, a critic can provide a well-rounded perspective about the movie and enable potential viewers to make informed decisions about whether to watch it. Additionally, a longer review would also allow the critic to discuss any possible drawbacks, shortcomings, or areas that could have been improved. This sort of balanced evaluation is crucial for presenting an honest and objective analysis of a movie's overall quality. In conclusion, based on the short review provided, it seems that the critic is thinking positively of the movie, and that the movie was seen as a fresh and potentially original piece of cinema.

Here is a news article: SEARCY COUNTY -- Searcy County Sheriff Joey Pruitt wants information concerning about 60 dogs found apparently shot to death on property in the far south of the county.      Pruitt said the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was initially notified Thursday of dead dogs on the property off of Arkansas Highway 254 in the Chimes/Trace Ridge area. That agency in turn notified his office.      He said about 60 dogs were found either dead or so severely wounded they had to be euthanized due to their suffering. Three dogs were still alive and were taken in for treatment. He said they were fairly healthy and not necessarily aggressive, but not extremely friendly either.      Pruitt said the dogs were apparently shot on scene in that isolated part of the county. People looking at the land as timber tracts found the first dogs, but others were found in the general area.      \\"It appears they were killed there,\\" Pruitt said.      Although some of the dogs did have ribs showing, they didn't appear to have been neglected or abused, the sheriff said.      None of the dogs had collars or name tags, and they could have been on the property for two or three days, Pruitt said.      A dog rescue operation had been shut down in Searcy County a few years ago, but there were no immediate clues where the dogs might have originated, Pruitt said. It was his understanding that the suspect in that case had moved on from Searcy County.      \\"Right now, I'm going to say we don't have any leads that have checked out,\\" Pruitt said Friday evening.      Pruitt said Arkansas State Police had also been notified of the incident. Anyone with information regarding the investigation is asked to call the Searcy County Sheriff's Office at (870) 448-2340.      The investigation was still in its early stages Friday. ||||| CHIMES, Ark. -      A gruesome discovery was made on Thursday afternoon in southern Searcy County, just off of Arkansas 254 in the Chimes-Trace Ridge Area south of Marshall.      The Searcy County sheriff says two people from a lumber mill came into a remote forest area to look at the timber tracts. They were disturbed by what they found: dozens of dead dogs scattered throughout the woods.      John Magruder still can't believe his eyes, two days later. He's shelter manager for the Searcy County Humane Society.      It's difficult to look at the bullet riddled bodies and consider their innocent lives. Magruder wasn't there to gawk, however. He was looking for survivors.      \\"I don't really have any words for what it makes me feel like. I've worked with dogs all my life and I love them a whole bunch and I just don't deal well with this, but I'm doing my best so I can save the ones I can,\\" said Magruder.      The sheriff is also shocked.      \\"This is my first in 25 years of law enforcement I've never seen anything like this,\\" said Sheriff Joey Pruitt.      No one lives in the timber land where the massacre occurred. The sheriff thinks someone brought the dogs out here, fed them poison, and opened fire.      \\"Systematically just start shooting and just leaving them lying and not even making sure that they're dead. I just can't imagine somebody doing that,\\" Pruitt said.      The sheriff and state investigators recovered evidence, but they're still processing the massive crime scene. No suspects have been named, but the sheriff does want to reassure the public, \\"I don't think they're stealing people's pets.\\"      So far 56 dogs have been found either poisoned and/or shot to death. Another dog that was shot and wounded had to be put down by a game warden, bringing the total to 57. Magruder says there was no hope of saving the dog that had to be euthanized because of its injuries.      A few dogs survived. That's why Magruder was out in the forest for the third day in a row. He had a dog travel crate, and a bag of food. He's been feeding survivors and trying to lure and rescue them.      One female was too skittish to approach the food. She lurked in the woods, but didn't stray from her murdered pack.      Magruder already rescued four other dogs and took them back to the Searcy County Humane Society shelter.      \\"We caught these two little female dogs. We brought them in this morning. This dog in here has been shot,\\" said Magruder.      Only one of the male dogs is recovering from a bullet. It passed through the shoulder and is beginning to heal. Magruder checked on him, \\"You doing okay, Bubba?\\"      \\"They could have found homes for these dogs. Why? Just why?\\" asked Jean Passmore, the Humane Society treasurer.      Her emotions are raw and she broke into tears while discussing the crime.      The people of this Humane Society are trying to channel their anger into nursing the survivors back to health.      Magruder says three of the four rescued survivors were skittish and difficult to catch. One little dog came right to Magruder, though, eager for love.      \\"He saw us, and that I had a bag of treats, and he took a treat and he was in the truck (immediately). He said, 'I've had enough of this,'\\" Magruder said.      Soon, he'll be up for adoption.      \\"Who could hurt him? Why would you hurt him?\\"      The Searcy County Humane Society can be reached at 870-448-5579. It also has a list of pets ready for adoption on its Facebook page.      Magruder and Passmore say they need donations to help cover medical costs and maintenance of the shelter. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A deeply distressing incident occurred in Searcy County, Arkansas, where around 60 dogs were found shot to death in a remote forest area.

Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy.

In a surprising and delightful collaboration, the White House and Kid President joined forces to bring joy and humor to the American public, proving that even the highest office in the US can let its hair down and enjoy a good prank. Meeting of the Titans: Kid President and POTUS Robby Novak, a.k.a Kid President, sprang into the limelight with his series of motivational and charming videos on YouTube, where he gave life advice, encouragement, and plenty of laughs. Backed by his effervescent personality and wit, Kid President garnered a strong following over the years. This allowed the extraordinary encounter between Kid President and the President of the United States, an event that left the audience euphoric and amused. Preparations for the Big Prank: With Kid President and the White House teaming up, weeks of brainstorming and meticulous planning ensued. It was essential for the prank to come across as entertaining and joyful without crossing the line into political discourse. The amount of work put in by both parties was evident in the elaborate setup of the April Fool's Day event. April Fool’s Day D-Day: On April 1st, an official White House press conference led by the-then President Barack Obama started off the event. The audience, including seasoned reporters and political enthusiasts, held their breath in anticipation. However, the entry of Kid President, dressed in miniature presidential attire, signaled that something mischievous was afoot, causing the audience to burst into spontaneous laughter and applause.

Conclusion: The unprecedented collaboration between Kid President and the White House on April Fool's Day showcased the power of humor and camaraderie in breaking traditional and politically polarizing barriers. Enabling citizens from all walks of life to come together and indulge in laughter, it was a testament to the fact that just because an institution is high-ranking does not mean it is precluded from participating in good-natured, harmless fun. In a world where the division and strife often seem relentless, moments like these remind us that there are pervasive threads that hold the fabric of society together. Humor, warmth, and childhood innocence can draw people in, regardless of their backgrounds, making pranks like the Kid President's White House takeover simultaneously engaging and heartwarming."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Placing a potato where can cause an explosion? - pantry - exhaust pipe - vegetable soup - pot - shopping bags  The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"An exhaust pipe. While placing a potato in other locations such as a pantry, vegetable soup, pot, or shopping bags might be harmless or even appropriate in the case of storage or cooking, putting a potato in the exhaust pipe of a vehicle has the potential to cause damage or an explosion. Here's why: An exhaust pipe serves a crucial function in a vehicle's operation; it is designed to expel noxious gases, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, produced by the combustion process inside the engine. By allowing these gases to escape, an exhaust pipe helps to decrease the engine's temperature and reduce pollution. Inserting a potato into an exhaust pipe blocks the gas flow and creates considerable back pressure, affecting the engine's performance. As the potato blocks the pipe, exhaust gases are forced back into the engine itself due to the increased pressure. This can lead to several issues, including: 1. Damage to the vehicle's engine: The increased back pressure can cause the engine's internal components, such as the pistons, cylinder walls, valves, gaskets, or catalytic converter, to suffer damage or become worn. 2. Loss of engine power: The impaired exhaust flow caused by the potato obstruction means that the engine will struggle to expel gases as it should. This results in reduced power output and the engine working harder to function properly. 3. Overheating of the engine: As the exhaust gases are not being expelled efficiently, the engine's temperature can rise rapidly, which may lead to overheating or ultimately a complete engine breakdown. 4. Potential explosion: Although it might not always result in an explosion, having a potato in the exhaust pipe dramatically increases the risk. If the pressure reaches a dangerous level and affects the engine's essential components, such as the fuel or electrical systems, it could result in a spontaneous combustion or explosion. In summary, placing a potato in an exhaust pipe can cause significant damage to a vehicle's engine, leading to engine failure, overheating, or even an explosion. Thus, it is strongly advised not to insert foreign objects into an exhaust pipe as it puts your safety and the vehicle's performance at risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get. A:","output":"A: What is the primary reason for having Leap Day in our calendar system? 1. To celebrate Julius Caesar's achievements 2.

Question: Process:  - Blood sugar levels increase after a meal - Cells in the pancreas release insulin - Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal - Blood sugar is too low - The amount of insulin goes down - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose - The liver releases the glucose into the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the pancreas releases insulin randomly happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the pancreas releases insulin randomly, it would affect the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. To analyze the possible effects, let's consider the given blood sugar regulation process step-by-step and compare it with the perturbation hypothesis. Normal Blood Sugar Regulation Process: 1. Blood sugar levels increase after a meal. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin. 3. Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood. 4. Blood sugar levels go back to normal. 5. If blood sugar levels are too low, the amount of insulin decreases. 6. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon. 7. The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose. 8. The liver releases the glucose into the blood. 9. Blood sugar levels go back to normal. Perturbed Scenario (random insulin release): 1. Blood sugar levels may or may not increase after a meal. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin randomly. 3. Insulin may cause the body to absorb glucose from the blood without an increase in blood sugar levels. 4. Blood sugar levels could decrease or remain normal after glucose absorption. Now, let's examine the potential effects of random insulin release on blood sugar regulation: - In the perturbed scenario, there may be instances where insulin is released even when blood sugar levels are normal or low. This could cause a decrease in blood sugar levels, potentially leading to hypoglycemia (abnormally low blood sugar). - In cases where blood sugar levels are high after a meal and insulin is released randomly, there's a reduced likelihood of adequate insulin release to help maintain a normal blood sugar level. This could ultimately lead to hyperglycemia (abnormally high blood sugar). - The perturbed insulin release may also affect the balance between insulin and glucagon, which are critical for maintaining blood sugar levels within a normal range. In particular, random insulin release might lead to less glucagon being released, as it might mask low blood sugar events that would normally trigger glucagon release. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of random insulin release would have both direct and indirect effects on the regulation of blood sugar levels. This could potentially lead to consequences such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, making blood sugar regulation less precise and ultimately less effective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences provide information about Staf Scheirlinckx, stating his birthdate, birthplace, profession, and his relationship to another professional cyclist, Bert Scheirlinckx.  However, there are some minor differences in sentence structure and phrasing between the two: 1. The first sentence uses the term \\"road cyclist\\" while the second sentence uses the more specific term \\"professional road bicycle racer.\\" The difference between these two terms is minimal, as they both refer to a professional athlete within the same sport. 2. The first sentence places \\"former\\" before \\"Belgian road cyclist,\\" indicating that Staf is no longer an active professional cyclist. The second sentence uses \\"Belgian former professional road bicycle racer,\\" which also states that he is no longer actively participating in the sport. 3. The first sentence separates the date with commas (March 12 , 1979), whereas the second sentence uses an alternate format (12 March 1979).

Movie title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Context: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma.

Does it follow that \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case. \\"?","output":"There could be various reasons why he had not let them know that he was still working on the case. Let's explore some of the possible motives and scenarios, considering both perspectives - his own and the people involved who expected updates on the case progress. 1. Confidentiality and safety concerns: In some cases, revealing the ongoing investigation status to individuals or groups may cause panic, arouse suspicion or result in alerting the subjects under investigation. These could negatively impact the progress of the case and even put the investigator or others at risk. 2. Fear of interference: The individual working on the case might be concerned about external pressures or influences exerted on the investigation if they shared their ongoing work. In some instances, they might prefer to withhold information until they reach a significant breakthrough that would be more conclusive and leave less room for outside tampering or interference. 3. Desire for independent work: It's possible that the investigator values their autonomy and prefers working independently on cases without constantly updating concerned parties. This might stem from their personality, work style, or previous experiences where collaboration may have led to complications in case resolution. 4. Need for time and space: The investigator might have realized that the case is more complicated than initially assumed and requires a deeper analysis. By not disclosing the ongoing work, the investigator can buy time and space to explore the case without external pressure or the burden of expectations from others. 5. Lack of significant progress: Sometimes, investigators might not have concrete updates to share due to the nature of the case or challenges they encountered. In such scenarios, they might choose to withhold information until they have significant findings or breakthroughs that would be worthwhile to share. As for the second question, \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case?\\" - Yes, it essentially follows the same meaning, but it is phrased slightly differently. Both questions convey the same idea of enquiring as to why the individual did not inform others that they were still working on the case. The difference lies in the use of \\"hadn't\\" and \\"mentioned\\" in the second question, which implies a slightly more informal and conversational tone. However, both questions are asking for the same insight into the investigator's reasons for keeping the case's ongoing status undisclosed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: \\"Which English Monarch was the \\"\\"Count de Blois\\"\\"?\\"","output":"The English monarch who held the title \\"Count de Blois\\" was King Stephen, also known as Stephen of Blois. He was born around 1092 or 1096 in Blois, France, and was the third son of Stephen, Count of Blois, and Adela, who was the daughter of William the Conqueror. As a result, he was a member of the House of Blois, a noble family originating from the French region of the same name. King Stephen ruled from 1135 to 1154, occupying the English throne during a period known as \\"The Anarchy.\\" This era was marked by a struggle for power between the monarchy, the nobility, and the church. It began after the death of King Henry I, who had appointed his daughter, Empress Matilda, as his successor. However, Matilda's right to the throne was challenged by Stephen, her cousin, who claimed that Henry had nominated him on his deathbed. Quick to act, Stephen sailed to England and secured support from key nobles and the Church. On December 22, 1135, he was anointed king by the Archbishop of Canterbury, thus beginning his reign. However, his ascendance to the throne was not universally recognized, and a civil war erupted between his supporters and those that remained loyal to Empress Matilda. Stephen's reign was marked by conflict and political instability. His right to the throne was continuously challenged, and the monarchy's authority was weakened, allowing for the rise of powerful barons. During his rule, administrative structures fell into disarray, contributing to the decline of the royal government's effectiveness. Despite multiple setbacks, Stephen held onto the throne for nearly two decades. In 1153, Stephen and Matilda's son, the future King Henry II, reached an agreement known as the Treaty of Wallingford. This pact stipulated that Stephen would retain the crown for the remainder of his life, but that upon his death, the Angevin line of succession would be restored, and the English throne would pass to Henry. Consequently, when Stephen died on October 25, 1154, Henry ascended to the throne, marking the end of The Anarchy. In conclusion, Stephen of Blois was the English monarch who held the title \\"Count de Blois.\\" His rule was characterized by a tumultuous rivalry for the throne, which severely weakened the monarchy and ultimately led to a period of chaos. However, through a negotiated agreement, Stephen managed to maintain his position until his death, after which the Angevin line was restored with Henry II's reign."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation.

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996.

Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin.

Absolutely ridiculous...Amazon please take this show off Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","output":"This product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the show by using words and phrases such as \\"horrible review,\\" \\"I have no idea,\\" \\"absolutely ridiculous,\\" and directly calling out Amazon to remove the show. These word choices and expressions all point towards a highly unfavorable view of the mentioned show. The reviewer questions the reasoning behind the show's production, demonstrating that they consider it a complete waste of time, resources, and effort. By saying \\"I have no idea how or why a show like this was ever put into production,\\" they imply that the show is lacking any redeeming qualities that would justify its existence. This further reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the review. Moreover, when the reviewer writes \\"Absolutely ridiculous,\\" it is evident that they are not only unhappy with the show but also consider it to be absurd and nonsensical. This further accentuates the dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, revealing a deep level of disapproval regarding the content of the show. Lastly, by addressing Amazon directly and asking them to take the show off, the reviewer not only reinforces their negative perception of the show but also showcases a level of frustration or concern that such a show is even available on the platform. This request indicates that the reviewer does not want other users to be subjected to the same unpleasant experience they had while watching the show. This emphatic plea adds to the overall negative sentiment communicated within the review.  In conclusion, the product review expresses a very negative sentiment towards the show. The choice of words, phrases, and the direct address to Amazon indicate that the reviewer holds an unfavorable and disapproving view of the show and wishes for it to be removed from the platform."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \\"May I help you?\\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \\"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks.  He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack.  Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Can we infer the following? toms dog is named cheemo","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that Tom's dog is named Cheemo. The passage does not provide any information related to the dog's name. Instead, it focuses on the behavior of Tom's dog fetching Tom's slippers and how it stopped doing so when the slippers smelled bad. Once Tom got a new pair of slippers, the dog resumed fetching them. Several observations can be made based on the passage: 1. Tom's dog has been trained to fetch slippers: It is mentioned that Tom trained his dog to get his slippers for him, and the dog would do it every single time, establishing that it has been conditioned to perform this specific task. 2. The dog stopped fetching the slippers when they smelled bad: It is possible that the odor from the slippers was unappealing to the dog, causing him to stop fetching them. This suggests that dogs might exhibit certain behaviors or preferences based on their olfactory senses. 3. The dog resumed fetching when Tom got a new pair: The fact that the dog resumed fetching slippers when Tom got a new pair suggests the negative olfactory factor played a role in its behavior change. Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell, and it seems likely that the odor of the old slippers was the primary deterrent for the dog's refusal to fetch them. However, none of the given information reveals the name of Tom's dog. Therefore, inferring that the dog's name is Cheemo cannot be substantiated by the passage.

Q:You are given a new situation: Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid.  and a hint : The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.  Please answer this question : Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"To answer the question, let's first go step by step through the given information: 1. Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid. 2. Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. 3. Stronger acids have a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) than weaker acids. 4. Stronger acids have a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. 5. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa value than weaker acids. Now, we know from the information above that Jacob has a strong acid and Thomas has a weak acid.

Only Mack's chief of staff heeded Apple's siren call, making him and his boss two of just 86 iPhone users at work in the House of Representatives. Other aides still cling to the familiar, part of a sea of 9,140 BlackBerry stalwarts in the House. This disparity also holds true based on retail sales or a stroll along most any downtown block at lunchtime -- evidence that Washington's attachment to the sturdy, e-mail-focused BlackBerry has been unshakable. No matter that the flashier, more Web-friendly iPhone has reshaped the smartphone landscape, letting users trade contact information by simply bumping phones or find the nearest Chinese restaurant by taking a picture of a street. Although no one keeps a tally of government-issued BlackBerrys, they number in the tens of thousands, as evidenced by hordes of federal employees tapping away at them on the Metro. Even outside the Beltway, BlackBerrys still far outnumber iPhones. But the Steve Jobs creation, with its thousands of downloadable applications, overwhelmingly dominates the country's mobile Web usage. Which is why Mack and others are waging a get-with-it campaign to square the federal government with how the rest of the country consumes mobile data and ignores spouses and children at dinner. \\"There are people in my office who are bucking change,\\" acknowledged Mack, whose wife, Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.), is also an iPhone enthusiast. \\"I think I can be persuasive. I'll let them decide on their own -- or I will force them. We're slow about adopting a lot of things in this town. But I can feel the change coming.\\" Evolving from an e-mail-obsessed BlackBerry town to a whiz-bang app town would represent a significant shift in how the government does business. A program that turns a phone into a document scanner would let government officials manage their work lives on the go. Instead of e-mailing back and forth with several colleagues, a group could conduct a four-way instant message chat in real time. The shift from centralized to decentralized, from action to interaction would flow to the thousands of companies across the region that do business with the federal government. \\"The iPhone introduced a new paradigm, the apps paradigm, and that paradigm is everything that matters now,\\" said tech guru Tim O'Reilly, who has been introducing apps developers to the people who run federal agencies. \\"But a lot of people in D.C. really love their BlackBerrys, and they have a strong relationship with them.\\" \\"Love\\" may be too shallow a word to describe this region's fixation with the BlackBerry, an addictive e-mail powerhouse that so far lacks the technological innards for the rich, data-heavy apps that have become so popular on other smartphones. (No, not just games in which people throw sheep at each other via their Facebook apps.) Washington is the country's eighth-largest metro region but the fourth-biggest user of BlackBerrys according to Localytics, which tracks mobile app usage. Best Buy sells more BlackBerrys in the Washington region than it does elsewhere, said Scott Anderson, the retailer's senior director of mobile merchants. Introduced in 1999, the BlackBerry was the first mobile device that could send secure e-mail outside the office, and law firms (there are a few around here, always hunting for more billable hours) quickly adopted the technology. The government joined in, making the BlackBerry an essential tool for communication. Summary:","output":"In Washington, the traditional preference for BlackBerry devices among government officials is being challenged by the growing popularity of iPhones. Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack is urging his aides to switch to iPhones, but the uptake has so far been slow, with only Mack's chief of staff making the change. Out of the 9,140 BlackBerry users in the House of Representatives, only 86 have adopted iPhones. Despite BlackBerry devices dominating the Washington landscape, iPhones account for a larger volume of mobile web usage in the country, due to their downloadable applications. Shifting from a focus on email to a more app-centric approach could signify a change in the way government conducts business, but the strong relationship between Washington and BlackBerry may be hard to break."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film begins during the German air raids in London in 1940. An elderly Dr. John Watson tells his nurse the tale of an unrecorded case he shared with his friend Sherlock Holmes. In 1882, Holmes and Watson investigate the shipwreck of a royal treasury ship which was destroyed by a monstrous giant octopus on the coast of Newhaven. They do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack, but nonetheless investigate. Inspector Lestrade states that he has recently had contact with Holmes's estranged brother Thorpe, a former partner of Lestrade's who was paralyzed during a bank robbery seven years prior. In Whitechapel, a young man is killed by a dinosaur. Watson is skeptical until he and Holmes discover the creature on their morning constitution. Finding escape, several more clues lead Holmes to deduce that the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius to acquire resources. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and rolls of copper wire, presumably so Spring-Heeled Jack can create another monster. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly \\"exceptionally improbable\\". Lestrade accompanies Holmes and Watson during their investigation. On one of their leads, Lestrade ends up missing. Holmes's reasoning leads himself and Watson to an old castle in Helmsmouth he and his brother visited as children. They come across another monster, a masked mechanical man: Spring-Heeled Jack. Spring-Heeled Jack is revealed to be Holmes' brother, Thorpe, who also assumed the identity of a patient of Watson's. Inesidora Ivory, his accomplice, is with him. Thorpe explains that he built a mechanical suit to cure his paralysis, and he deduced that the crippling bullet ricocheted off a doorframe, fired by Lestrade. He plans to destroy London, assassinate Queen Victoria and force Lestrade to claim responsibility. Ivory is revealed to be one of Thorpe's creations and his lover, and she carries that will detonate when she... The answer is:","output":"No answer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling.  - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921  8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\".  - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914  5 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage, he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" in which he played eight different characters. He is also known for his six collaborations with David Lean: Herbert Pocket in \\"Great Expectations\\" (1946), Fagin in \\"Oliver Twist\\" (1948), Col. Nicholson in \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" (1957, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Prince Faisal in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (1962), General Yevgraf Zhivago in \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" (1965), and Professor Godbole in \\"A Passage to India\\" (1984).

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post.

He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea. contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen?, what is it ?","output":"The first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen is Charlotte Sophia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To fill this gap in the literature, mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles. Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces. The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of: first and second mandolins, mandolas (either octave mandolas, tuned an octave below the mandolin, or tenor mandolas, tuned like the viola), mandocellos (tuned like the cello), and bass instruments (conventional string bass or, rarely, mandobasses). Smaller ensembles, such as quartets composed of two mandolins, mandola, and mandocello, may also be found.

The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation.

Select from: -- no -- yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about possible solutions to the ongoing conflict in the Kashmir region. As for the solution to the Kashmir conflict, there is no simple answer to this question. However, a detailed analysis of the historical and political context of the issue, as well as multiple suggested approaches, may provide a broader understanding. 1. Historical Background: The conflict over Kashmir traces back to the partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. According to the partition plan, the princely states were given the choice to join either India or Pakistan. Hari Singh, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, was indecisive and wanted to maintain independence due to the region's diverse religious and ethnic composition. In October 1947, Pakistan allegedly supported tribal raiders who tried to annex Kashmir, forcing Hari Singh to ask India for help. In return, he agreed to accede to India, resulting in the first Indo-Pakistan war of 1947-48. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire that divided the region along the Line of Control (LOC). The conflicting claims by India and Pakistan over Kashmir have since led to multiple wars, skirmishes, and diplomatic stand-offs. 2. Possible Approaches to a Solution: a) Dialogue: The foremost step in resolving the conflict is initiating consistent, meaningful, and result-oriented dialogues between India and Pakistan. These dialogues must cover all aspects of the conflict, including autonomy, cross-border terrorism, and the demilitarization of the region. Besides, dialogues between the central government and the local stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir are essential in understanding the aspirations of the people and addressing their grievances. b) Confidence Building Measures (CBMs): CBMs are required to create an environment conducive to peace and to build trust between the conflicting parties. They may include: improved trade relations, easing of travel restrictions across the LOC, regular meetings between the border security forces, and cultural exchange programs to deepen understanding between the peoples of the two nations. c) UN and International Diplomacy: The United Nations can play an essential role in facilitating negotiations and diplomatic efforts between India and Pakistan. It could also help in implementing the agreed-upon resolutions through international monitoring and assistance. d) Plebiscite: The United Nations resolution 47, adopted in 1948, calls for a free and impartial plebiscite in the region to allow the inhabitants of Jammu and Kashmir the right to decide their own future. However, this solution is complex, given the demographic changes since 1948, the influence of extremist ideologies, and the reluctance from both India and Pakistan to conduct a plebiscite. e) Trilateral Dialogue: Involving China, which administers Aksai Chin and Shaksgam Valley in the region, in the dialogues could provide an additional perspective and possibly lead to a more comprehensive solution to the conflict. f) Bilateral Agreements: Bilateral agreements, such as the Simla Agreement (1972) and the Lahore Declaration (1999), that reaffirm commitment to peaceful resolutions of disputes and adherence to agreed-upon principles can serve as avenues for continued negotiations. It is crucial to understand that the resolution of the Kashmir conflict requires a sincere, dedicated, and sustained effort from all parties involved. The process needs to respect the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, ensuring their fundamental rights to life, liberty, and equitable development. Moreover, long-term peace can only be achieved when the solutions derive from open and inclusive dialogues, involving the willing cooperation of India, Pakistan, and the people of Kashmir."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? pan","output":"To accomplish the goal of mastering the art of pan, one must assume that \\"pan\\" refers to \\"panning\\" in photography, cooking with a pan, or the musical instrument called the steelpan (also known as the steel drum). Here, I will provide detailed steps for all three interpretations. 1. Panning in Photography: Panning is a photography technique used to capture moving subjects while emphasizing motion. To master this technique, follow these steps: a. Choose the right equipment: Use a camera with manual settings or a smartphone camera with a \\"manual\\" or \\"pro\\" mode. A DSLR or mirrorless camera is ideal. b. Select the appropriate settings: Set a slower shutter speed (between 1/30 and 1/125 of a second) to capture motion blur in the background. Adjust ISO and aperture settings accordingly to maintain proper exposure. c. Choose a suitable location: Find a location where your subject, such as a car, cyclist, or runner, will be moving parallel to your position. d. Frame your shot: Set your focus on the subject and use a wide focal length to capture the scene and allow for potential errors in panning movement. e. Track the subject: Follow the subject with your camera, maintaining a smooth and steady motion while pre-focusing on the subject to ensure sharpness. f. Take the shot: As the subject enters the frame, press the shutter while still tracking the subject, and continue the motion for a split second after the shot. g. Practice and refine your technique: Mastering panning requires time and patience, so keep practicing and making adjustments to your settings and technique. 2. Cooking with a Pan: Mastering the art of cooking with a pan involves understanding different techniques and types of pans. Follow these steps: a. Purchase the right pans: Invest in a variety of high-quality pans, such as a non-stick skillet, cast iron skillet, and a stainless-steel sauté pan. b. Learn about heat management: Understand the differences between low, medium, and high heat and when to use each setting for specific dishes. c. Master essential cooking techniques: Learn various cooking methods, such as sautéing, pan-frying, deglazing, simmering, and braising. d. Build your culinary skills: Develop knife skills, learn to make sauces, and study various cuisines to expand your knowledge and repertoire. e. Practice, practice, practice: The more you cook with a pan, the better you will become. Experiment with new recipes and techniques to continue honing your skills. 3. Playing the Steelpan (Steel Drum): To master the steelpan, an instrument typically associated with Caribbean music, follow these steps: a. Choose the right steelpan: There are several types of steelpans, such as tenor, double tenor, double second, and bass. Consider your musical goals and preferences while selecting the appropriate one. b. Find a teacher or instructional resources: Look for a steelpan instructor, online courses, or instructional books and videos to learn the basics and proper technique. c. Understand the layout: Familiarize yourself with the pan's layout, which is designed with notes placed according to their musical relationship. d. Learn the proper playing technique: Hold rubber-tipped mallets and strike the surface of the steelpan at precise angles using a controlled wrist motion. e. Practice scales and songs: Start with basic scales to get familiar with the instrument's layout, then progress to simple songs and finally more advanced pieces. f. Join a steelpan ensemble or band: Playing with others will help develop your skills and provide valuable performance experience. g. Dedicate time to practice: Like any musical instrument, mastering the steelpan requires consistent practice and patience. Regardless of which interpretation of \\"pan\\" you intended to pursue, remember that practice, patience, and a genuine interest in refining your skills are key to achieving your goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The given sentences are: Sentence 1: Begun during the Old Kingdom, it was the national shrine of the country (the St. Sentence 2: The national shrine of the country is three stories tall. Let's analyze the sentences one by one. Sentence 1 provides information about the national shrine of the country that it began during the Old Kingdom. However, the parentheses at the end of the sentence seem to have been cut off, which might leave out some key information. The statement does not provide any details about the height or structure of the national shrine. Sentence 2 provides information that the national shrine of the country is three stories tall. This statement indicates a physical characteristic of the national shrine without referring to any specific time period.

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices.

White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it. Paraiti is a medicine woman. She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society. If the secret is uncovered a life may be lost, but hiding it may also have fatal consequences. So Paraiti, Maraea and Rebecca become players in a head on clash of beliefs, deception and ultimate salvation.In the Extras of the DVD, Witi Ihimaera, tells how his mother took him to Paraiti, a tohunga/healer who cured him of a breathing problem. In writing the story, he wanted to honour the various tohunga in Maori life.   In 1907, the New Zealand government brought in  The Tohunga Suppression Act, thus outlawing natural healing for Maori.

In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening \\"sex drive-ins\\" Monday. The nine garage-style structures, located in Sihlquai, a former industrial zone in the city, are equipped with alarm buttons and guarded by security personnel to ensure the safety of the prostitutes. Customers are not allowed to leave the area with the sex workers. Read more: Brazil drops 'happy being a prostitute' ad campaign. \\"Prostitution has escalated in the city,\\" said Michael Herzig, from the Zurich social services department. \\"It was done out in the open on the street and men harassed passers-by. \\"It was noisy and dirty because men took the prostitutes to a side street and left used condoms on the streets. The drive-ins are more discreet and safer.\\" Herzig leads the project, which has cost 2.4 million Swiss francs (2.6 million) to set up. \\"The project is extremely controversial. Prostitution is about morals and religion. But we leave these things aside and see it as a business. The humanitarian aspect is more important for us,\\" said Herzig. Around 30 to 40 women are expected to work at the site each night. Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called \\"sex boxes,\\" but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee. Read more: Ahead of Brazil World Cup, free English classes planned for prostitutes. The drive-ins are open daily from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and can only be accessed by car. Drivers have to follow a clearly marked route to get to the area, where customers and sex workers can discuss the services offered and agree on a price. The client can then drive into the allocated box, where the service is provided. There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers. A gynecologist comes in once a week to offer health checkups for the women. The city's social services department is running the whole operation and also offers crash courses in German and self-defense courses for the women on site. \\"All of this will enhance the sex workers' living and working conditions,\\" Herzig said. Prostitution and consumption of paid sex are legal in Switzerland. Prostitutes are considered self-employed and are liable for taxation. \\"We are trying to promote the independence and self-determination of the sex workers,\\" he said. \\"It's not a unique concept. We went to Utrecht in the Netherlands and Cologne and Essen in Germany, where similar projects exist, to speak to organizers. In Utrecht it's been successfully implemented since 1986.\\" As well as backing from the authorities, the project in Zurich has a democratic mandate: A referendum was held in March 2012, with 52% of voters in favor.

When the NFL first announced that Coldplay would be playing the halftime show, a couple simple assumptions emerged: 1) They'd have to pay lip service to past Super Bowls (which they did, via a montage of past performers set to \\"Fix You\\"), and 2) Beyoncé would be joining, since Coldplay and Beyoncé had only recently released their collaboration song, \\"Hymn For the Weekend.\\"      It was also kind of expected that Beyoncé might outshine them.      To be fair, Coldplay gave it their eager best. Lead singer Chris Martin started the proceedings on the field, surrounded by fans, and then performed songs like \\"Viva La Vida\\" and \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" with a giant grin on his face and a hyperactive spring in his step. The band's Technicolor trappings paired with Martin's enthusiasm made for one of the most earnest halftime performances in recent memory. The whole thing felt as if it was unfolding underneath one of those rainbow kindergarten parachutes.      Then 2014 Super Bowl headliner Bruno Mars slid out to perform songwriter Mark Ronson's \\"Uptown Funk\\" with a slick line of dancers. It looked great; unfortunately, the audio was so mangled that viewers at home could barely hear anything above the screaming crowds. Still, both Martin and Mars seemed to be having a hell of a time.      And then the drum line parted, and there was Beyoncé.      It's not surprising that Beyoncé slayed; in 2013, she gave one of the best Super Bowl performances in the game's history. But there was far more behind Beyoncé's performance of her brand new single \\"Formation\\" than her shutting down the dance floor — which she did, even in a dance-off with Mars that included a gracefully swerved stumble.      The day before the Super Bowl, Beyoncé debuted the song by dropping one of her best and boldest videos yet.      As Vox's Alex Abad-Santos wrote, \\"Formation\\" is \\"riskier, filthier, angrier, and pulpier\\" than is typical for Beyoncé. It's also proudly steeped in black American culture, celebrates black femininity, and is overtly political, with Beyoncé sinking a New Orleans cop car as a little boy in a hoodie dances in front of riot cops.      And her Super Bowl performance followed right in the video's footsteps. Beyoncé emerged, flanked by black women backup dancers with Afros and Black Panther-adjacent uniforms, and clad in a jacket that echoed another iconic black performer: Michael Jackson, circa 1993.      So there was, as there always is, a little more than met the eye during Beyoncé's performance. And by the time Bruno Mars challenged Bey to a dance-off, she'd stolen the show once and for all. To top it all off, the second the broadcast cut away from all the shiny happy people singing Coldplay's finale to go to commercial, the first ad was for Beyoncé, announcing a new Formation world tour. She's since announced a new fund to help the children of Flint, Michigan, during the city's current water crisis.      Beyoncé performing \\"Formation\\" at the Super Bowl is a huge, purposeful statement. Putting black America center stage smack dab in the middle of Coldplay's set was a significant move right from the start, but it is especially poignant in the context of the song's defiant social commentary, the constant criticism against black Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for so-called excessive arrogance, and a 1.5 million donation from Tidal — Jay Z's ever-halting streaming service — to nonprofit social justice organizations like Black Lives Matter on February 5, the day Trayvon Martin would have turned 21.      In short, Beyoncé dominated the show the minute she stepped onto the field, from her knowing smirks during meticulously choreographed dances to the moment when she joined Coldplay and Mars onstage to make sure everyone knew she could smoke them while sharing the screen. More crucially, she transformed one of the biggest events in sports, corporate synergy, and entertainment into a distinctly political act.      But if you need more succinct proof of just how thoroughly Beyoncé's attitude and charisma overtook Martin's earnest bopping, here's a picture of Martin trying to squeeze between Bey and Mars; she's crushing the show too hard to even notice:      Beyoncé, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars wrapping up the Super Bowl Halftime show #SB50. pic.twitter.com/0JL3Z2MiYJ — Music News & Facts (@musicnews_facts) February 8, 2016      Take heart, Chris Martin: You did what you could.

Her idea of swag in this song is keeping a bottle of hot sauce in her purse. That’s seriously, gloriously specific.      WORTHAM Wesley, it’s the blackest of black. It’s not Pharrell’s new black (no shade!) — it’s your grandmother’s black. Her idea of swag is keeping hot sauce in her bag while she’s decked out in Givenchy. That’s baller, and that’s why the world slash Internet is going nuts. It’s a dab in a video form, playing on a loop; it’s phenomenally delicious.      CARAMANICA “Earned all this money but they never take the country out me”: What’s fascinating about this song and video is how Beyoncé renders her politics both literally and colloquially. Her radicalism is both overt and implicit — she knows that creatively drawn statements of black identity and pride are as powerful as any direct social-political statement.      I think you’re right, Wesley, in that she’s making clear her claims to her old identity even in this new space. But it’s also important to remember that she was doing similar things all over “Beyoncé,” the album she surprise released at the end of 2013.      “Formation” feels like a refinement and amplification of that album — it’s sinewy and thrusting, but also angular and tough. Between the song and the video, there’s the club, the church, the wig shop, line dancing, donks on parade, black cowboys and, yes, some footage of New Orleans borrowed from a mini-documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” (which the filmmakers seem alternately frustrated by and pleased with).      Beyoncé is both old South and new South — her musical and aesthetic approaches posit them as existing on a continuum. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(Scott Halleran/Getty Images)      There were freakouts over Red Lobster and hot sauce, Blue Ivy and #BlackLivesMatter. In the hours after Beyoncé released her surprise music video “Formation” on Saturday, social media was awash in praise, once again, for Queen B.      Except from two upset documentary filmmakers, who claimed their footage was used in the video without permission.      “New Beyonce video used hella clips from the doc I produced and directed,” Los Angeles-based filmmaker Chris Black wrote on Twitter. “…but why?!?!”      [Watch 2016 Super Bowl ads]      Black linked to a documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” which he created with director Abteen Bagheri. (NSFW warning, but you can watch it here.) Bagheri responded on Twitter, too: “I’m not mad. It’s the sad reality of the music business. Doesn’t affect my friends’ and my work, but not cool.”      The accusations were amplified by timing: “Formation” debuted on the eve of Super Bowl 50, where Beyoncé will perform her second halftime show, three years after her highly praised act in the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans. The song, which she is likely to play Sunday, features New Orleans as its backdrop and inspiration. That’s where the clips from “That B.E.A.T.,” a documentary about NOLA’s dance culture, come in.      A representative for Beyoncé told Entertainment Weekly that those clips were purchased fairly.      “The documentary footage was used with permission and licensed from the owner of the footage,” the representative said. “They were given proper compensation. The footage was provided to us by the filmmaker’s production company. The filmmaker is listed in the credits for additional photography direction. We are thankful that they granted us permission.”      Those credits aren’t listed beneath YouTube’s version of “Formation,” which has already been viewed more than 6 million times. Nor are they easy to find on Tidal, the Jay Z-owned steaming service where “Formation” debuted. To find them, head to VideoStatic, where Bagheri’s name is listed next to”additional photography direction.”      In a surprise release a day before her Super Bowl performance, Beyoncé dropped the song \\"Formation\\" and its music video. Here's a guide to the video, the lyrics and things you might have missed. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)      Black told the Fader, a music news site, that he received a request for permission in January. It came from director Lily Keber, who also has footage featured in the video. Black didn’t give Keber permission because he didn’t own the footage. He told Keber “That B.E.A.T.” was commissioned by Nokia in partnership with Sundance. That was the last he heard from Team Beyoncé, he said.      A spokesperson for Nokia said the company’s music services business was sold to Microsoft in 2014.      The Washington Post has reached out to Microsoft to ask whether it licensed the footage. If that’s the case, it appears that Microsoft, not the filmmakers, were paid for the clips.      “All we want is respect and credit,” Black said. “They don’t know what we sacrificed to make [the film]. They just came along and took it without crediting us.”      “Anyone who works in the industry knows that putting out a work is a miracle,”Bagheri said in an email to the Post. “There needs to be a unity amongst directors. We need to preserve the sanctity of the craft and champion individual voices. Our work isn’t just b-roll for someone else. It just shouldn’t be considered, whether or not it’s legal. It’s a bad precedent to set.”      Why Melina gotta use clips from our doc?!? Was the budget not big enough to spend a week in New Orleans and actually build with the people. — chris black (@TheBlack) February 6, 2016      Later in the day, “Formation” director Melina Matsoukas responded:      Must give much love to the beautiful NOLA footage shot and directed by @abteen and @lkeber to make #FORMATION whole. — melina matsoukas (@melinamatsoukas) February 7, 2016      Bagheri tweeted to Matsoukas thanking her for the recognition, and Black said they aren’t planning to pursue legal action. They may not have received money or prominent attribution, but it’s hard to imagine how being associated with Beyoncé wouldn’t benefit their careers.      Still, maybe they could ask her team to send over some of the new “Formation” merchandise that is already on sale.

Here's What People Are Saying      YouTube      Beyoncé is one of a kind — the kind of star who can drop a surprise music video and see much of the Internet and social media instantly explode.      \\"Formation,\\" released Saturday, has already racked up more than 7 million views on YouTube. It's full of implicit and explicit commentary on subjects like being black in America, Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter.      And the Internet responded swiftly.      The video is a \\"powerful proclamation of being a proud, powerful black woman,\\" writes Margaret E. Jacobsen on Romper. Jacobsen connects the imagery of the video to #BlackGirlMagic, a hashtag used to celebrate African-American women on Twitter.      The song is \\"an anthem for black women,\\" writes Jacobsen. \\"And the response has been amazing. Following the video's release, we're talking about the blood that runs through our veins and the hoods we grew up in. We're holding all of those in our black communities who came before us up high. We're wearing every little thing that's contributed to our blackness proudly. We're letting our black girl magic shine.\\"      At The Root, Danielle C. Belton says the video is \\"black\\" — \\"cornbread and collard greens black. 'Hot sauce in my bag' black. Southern black. Dirty South black. Your grandma telling you to go cut down a switch black,\\" she writes. \\"Did you know Beyoncé was black?\\"      The video focuses on New Orleans, in particular, opening and closing with Beyoncé atop a New Orleans police car, with a background reminiscent of Hurricane Katrina.      The reference to the hurricane of a decade ago still resonates, says Regina N. Bradley on Red Clay Scholar.      \\"Katrina is not just a historical event,\\" she writes. \\"It is a springboard for re-rendering southern trauma and its association with blackness. Trauma is the spring board of southern blackness. But its foundation is resilience and creativity.\\"      The video also mixes in footage of New Orleans taken from the 2013 documentary That B.E.A.T. (which filmmakers initially said was used without permission).      \\"She wants us to know — more than ever — that she's still grounded, she's paying attention and still a little hood,\\" writes Jenna Wortham in The New York Times.      \\"I think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the Super Bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\\"      The video is political. A boy dances in front of a line of police officers in riot gear. He raises his hands — but so does the line of cops. Graffiti on the wall reads \\"Stop shooting us,\\" echoing the principal demand from Black Lives Matter activists for reform in policing and criminal justice.      As The Daily Beast noted, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z have paid to bail out protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson. And Tidal, a music service that Jay-Z started and Beyoncé partly owns, announced a 1.5 million donation to the Black Lives Matter movement and other social justice groups.      Beyoncé was always political, because she had to be, says The Root's Belton.      \\"What if I told you that to be black in a public space, with all eyes on you and choosing carefully how to handle that spotlight is a form of politics, a negotiation between the self and the world that all black people must make?\\"      The video ends with the police car sinking into the water, Beyoncé lying on top.      That ending is a \\"celebration of the margins,\\" writes Zandria F. Robinson on New South Negress. \\"Black bodies in motion, women's voices centered, black queer voices centered — is what ultimately vanquishes the state, represented by a NOPD car. Beyoncé as the conjured every-southern-black-woman, slays atop the car and uses the weight of her body to finish it off, sacrificing herself in the process.\\"      Zandria F. Robinson reads from her piece on New South Negress 3:31      The timing of the song's release, just before her performance at the Super Bowl, is also \\"not insignificant,\\" writes The New York Times' Wortham.      \\"She's electing to parade her substantial wealth and ability to outearn most men in the music industry (including her husband, Jay Z) during the Super Bowl — the flagship event of male virility and violence in this country.\\" ||||| Photo: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images      I’m sure I’m not the only one for whom a question infinitely more pressing than “Broncos or Panthers?” was “Will she play it or won’t she?” As everyone and your football-loving grandfather now knows, yesterday afternoon Beyoncé stopped the world and dropped the gloriously provocative, instantly iconic video for her new single, “Formation,” the most explicitly political work she’s released to date. The visuals are timely and stirring: A dancing, hoodie-clad black boy commands a line of riot-geared police officers to put their hands up; Beyoncé double-flips the bird in an image that makes me want Alejandro Jodorowsky to direct a remake of Gone With the Wind; and in the powerful final scene, Bey, proud daughter of the American South (“My daddy Alabama, my ma Louisiana”), sinks atop a cop car into Katrina’s murky waters.      I was afraid she wouldn’t play this song. That she’d take a more conservative route in the face of an organization that has banned or fined women of color for stepping out of line. I prepared myself for the disappointing possibility that she might just show up to do a cameo for that truly inexplicable Coldplay duet, do a few “Single Ladies” moves, and go collect her check. But now I must ask for forgiveness for doubting the Queen even for a second, because not only did she play “Formation,” she fearlessly led a squad of women dressed as Black Panthers across the field at the goddamned Super Bowl, all while dressed like the democratically elected ruler of Rhythm Nation. New plan: If Trump gets elected, I’m not moving to Canada — I’m moving to Beyoncé’s utopia.      This motley hodgepodge of a Pepsi-sponsored Super Bowl Halftime Show had a theme, senior-prom-style, and that theme was “Past, Present, and Future.” Those three words do literally nothing to explain what Coldplay, Bruno Mars, and Beyoncé were doing on a stage together, save for throwing some gentle shade at Coldplay’s tired old Sgt. Pepper–does–Mardi Gras aesthetic. But I’ll go easy on the Fab Adequate Four, who took the stage first. The internet’s inevitable deluge of Coldplay-snark felt excessive; their performance was spirited and benignly feel-good, even if I am not exactly seeking out a copy of Chris Martin’s isolated vocal track. But the exuberant and anthemic quality of “Viva La Vida” worked in a context like this, and their disco-tinged recent single “Adventure of a Lifetime” suitably sustained the energy. Chris Martin seemed happy to be there and also seemed to be getting a great cardiovascular workout, complete with many squats. Were the children watching at home more scandalized by Janet Jackson’s boob or M.I.A.’s middle finger than they were by almost seeing Chris Martin’s butt crack? Only time will tell.      Then the preternaturally suave Bruno Mars came out in an expertly tailored Missy Elliott garbage bag and did a kind of B-Boy remix of “Uptown Funk.” Was this supposed to represent “the Past”? Or was this “the Present,” and considered an homage to the “this sick beat” part in Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” video? (I kid!) This was the precise moment I stopped asking questions about the performance’s theme, and also the precise moment I went back on my words that I would never tire of hearing “Uptown Funk.”      Beyoncé’s performance of “Formation” was a welcome gust of now-ness and relevance in a show so often bogged down with Greatest Hits montages and (see above) played-to-death radio smashes we never needed to hear again. Has anyone ever used the Super Bowl Halftime Show as a showcase for a song they released yesterday? The whole thing was a display of Beyoncé’s unimpeachable confidence in her own cultural influence and artistic vision, and the contrast of Coldplay and Bruno Mars emphasized just how radical that vision really is. Would the show have been more entertaining and thematically coherent if Beyoncé had been given the whole 15 minutes? Of course. But something about the contrast between the performers and her casual domination of that shared stage actually asserted her singularity in the pop landscape more dramatically than she might have on her own. There it was, plain to see for 100 million people: Chris Martin is left shark. Bruno Mars is right shark. Beyoncé is the nucleus.      After “Formation,” the performance inexplicably turned into an “In Memorium” montage set to the soaring strains of one of Coldplay’s best songs, “Fix You.” Sure, why not. Coldplay’s music has a kind of one-size-fits-all grandeur about it, so this audiovisual pairing made as much sense as any. “Fix You” on the jukebox at 3 a.m.? If you insist. “Fix You” at your bar mitzvah? Not mad. But Coldplay’s aural vagueness only served to put the precision of Beyoncé’s message into harsher relief. Sure, in the midst of the nation’s continued racial tensions, Coldplay’s fuzzy message that everything will be okay if we just (hold your cards high, audience) “BELIEVE IN LOVE” might have struck some as tone-deaf and silly. But Beyoncé, on the other hand, didn’t need to say it. Her song, her staging, her slaying delivered a harder-won message loud and clear.      As the crowd roared, we still did not get our answer to that other pressing question: “Yeah but why’s she here again?” And then we did: An ad for her just-announced Formation World Tour ran in one of the televisual year’s most sought-after commercial slots. You could almost see the ripple of lightbulbs going off across the globe: Beyoncé, that Black Bill Gates in the Making, basically just got paid to run an ad at the Super Bowl. It felt, elegantly, like an echo of that last line of “Formation”: “Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Beyoncé dominated the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with an explosive performance of her new single, \\"Formation.\\" The song, released only a day before the event, has been widely praised as a celebration of black American culture and identity. With powerful imagery and political references, the video includes scenes of Beyoncé sinking a New Orleans cop car and a young, hoodie-clad, black boy dancing in front of riot police. Seen by many as her most overtly political work to date, Beyoncé's performance of the song at the Super Bowl marked a significant moment, highlighting black pride, solidarity, and defiance on one of the biggest stages in sports, corporate, and entertainment. The song has already received millions of views on YouTube and has been described as an anthem for black women, an expression of black identity and pride that resonates with the current racial tensions in America."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was convicted in absentia in 1985 for links to NAR, a fascist group blamed over the 1980 Bologna train station bombing, which killed 85 people. He now leads a party called Forza Nuova (New Force). Another deputy to Mr Fiore is Artemis Matthaiopoulos from Greece's Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party which sports Nazi-style symbols. Party members have been accused of serious crimes including murder, and some went on trial last year. The APF also embraces the German National Democratic Party (NPD), whose leader Udo Voigt is an MEP. Germany's Constitutional Court is considering whether to ban the NPD. Nationalist surge challenges Europe A source at the parliament told the BBC that grants to European parties were usually transferred at the end of March, and \\"should money have been paid unduly, it will need to be reimbursed\\". If enough MEPs object, a parliamentary committee will assess whether the APF acts in accordance with EU principles, namely \\"liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law\\". As head of the powerful European People's Party (EPP) group Manfred Weber should be able to get the required 25% of MEPs united against the grant, the source said. Last month Mr Weber wrote to other parliamentary group leaders and Parliament President Martin Schulz, saying there should be no such EU support for \\"some of the most radical and militant right-wing extremist parties\\". Similar complaints against the APF were made by MEPs Marita Ulvskog (Sweden) and Daniele Viotti (Italy). In its programme the APF says it stands for \\"promoting our common Christian values\\" and giving a voice to citizens who are \\"alienated from the democratic process\\" in the EU. The APF has forged links with officials close to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has condemned Nato, alleging that Western politicians are fomenting \\"Russophobia\\". The far-right grouping expressed solidarity with Serbian nationalists commemorating the 1999 Nato bombing of Serbia. \\"The memories of the many innocent victims of Nato missiles and of the Islamist death squads of Albanians and Arab Jihadis in Kosovo are still raw,\\" it said on Facebook. Mr Griffin, who was expelled by the BNP in 2014, argues that Western leaders are fulfilling a \\"neo-con/Zionist\\" agenda, which helps Israel. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF), a far-right nationalist European political party, may have its funding from the European Union blocked. Critics describe the group as a \\"neo-Nazi\\" movement. The party and its associated foundation, Europa Terra Nostra, were granted €400,000 and €197,625 respectively by the European Parliament in January. However, if 25% of the Parliament’s 751 Members of European Parliament’s (MEPs), from at least three political groups, request that the APF’s funds be blocked, then this will happen. The group’s deputy chairman is former British National Party (BNP) leader, Nick Griffin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) Question: How did the bully behave after learning the cool trick? Options:  A. Upset  B. Impressed  C.

Scott Walker’s anti-public employee union proposals, are walking back reports in the Wall Street Journal that they plan to return to the state.      “We are now looking at returning to the state capitol and requiring the senators to take a vote and have them declare who they’re with — the workers or the governor,” Minority Leader Mark Miller told the Journal.      A return to Wisconsin at this juncture would appear to give the green light for Walker’s legislation to pass — that is, a win for Walker’s efforts to pass legislation when numerous polls show the state disapproving of Walker, and saying he should compromise. However, at this juncture it is unclear just what is going on.      In response, Miller spokesman Mike Browne released this statement, saying only that they were continuing to negotiate towards an outcome that does not strip the bargaining rights of state workers:                                    “It is true that negotiations were dealt a setback since last Thursday when Governor Walker responded to a sincere Democratic compromise offer with a press conference. However, Senate Democrats have continued to reach out to the Governor and Republicans through the weekend.            Democrats remain hopeful that Governor Walker and legislative Republicans will, in the near future, listen to the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites who believe they should come to the negotiating table in good faith to reach an agreement that resolves our fiscal issues without taking away worker rights and without hurting programs that help provide health insurance for working families and prescription drugs for seniors.”      In addition, state Sen. Chris Larson released this statement:      Sen. Miller’s comments are taken out of context in the Wall Street Journal article just released. Dems will return when collective bargaining is off the table. That could be soon based on the growing public opposition to the bill and the recall efforts against Republicans. Unfortunately, the WSJ fished for the quote they wanted, skipping this key step in logic: we won’t come back until worker’s rights are preserved.      State Sen. Jon Erpenbach also told WisPolitics that Democrats are not planning to return. State Sen. Bob Jauch, who has been one of the lead negotiators, also said of Miller’s comments: “I think he’s speaking the truth that at some point - and I don’t know when soon is - at some point we have to say we’ve done all we can.” ||||| CHICAGO — More than two weeks after Wisconsin lawmakers split over a bill that would vastly curtail collective bargaining for public workers, even negotiations over the negotiations have become matters of division, fury and dueling public critiques.      Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican leader in Wisconsin’s Senate, described the progress of talks with 14 Senate Democrats who left the state last month to block a vote on the bill as “negotiating with Jell-O.” And in a letter about the talks to his Democratic counterpart, Mr. Fitzgerald questioned his colleague’s “grasp of reality.”      Chris Larson, one of the Senate Democrats, accused Mr. Fitzgerald and Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who proposed the measure, of misleading the public, trying to shift blame to the Democrats, and “throwing people who were negotiating in earnest under the bus.”      And it was only Monday.      While those on both sides of Wisconsin’s partisan split over collective bargaining rights say they have in recent days engaged in private discussions over the matter, little progress toward compromise has emerged. If anything, the Republicans and Democrats in Wisconsin appeared further apart than ever over a matter that has eclipsed all other work in the state Capitol and become the most visible in a series of such battles in statehouses around the country.      Photo      That said, at least two Democrats said that an end to the standoff in Wisconsin may be drawing near, even if it means returning to the state and allowing a vote to take place on an unchanged and, in their view, unacceptable measure to cut collective bargaining rights — a measure that is expected to pass in the Republican-dominated State Senate once a quorum is met.      “You reach a point where you say, ‘If our goal was to enlighten the public, we’ve done it,’ ” Bob Jauch, one of the missing Democrats who took part in negotiations as recently as Sunday, said on Monday evening. “There’s a time — and the time seems to be drawing near — where our usefulness is wearing thin.”      Timothy Cullen, another of the Senate Democrats, said, “This is a movement that’s bigger than us, so it’s time to go home and debate and make the case on other issues.”      Photo      Other Senate Democrats said on Monday that they were still determined that the collective bargaining cuts in Mr. Walker’s plan be rewritten. A spokesman for Mark Miller, the Senate Democratic leader, said that no final decision had been made about how soon to return to Wisconsin.      “They meet every day,” the spokesman, Mike Browne, said, “and they discuss how to get back.”      Most of Indiana’s House Democrats remained at a motel in Illinois on Monday, having also left their state last month to prevent a quorum on legislation related to collective bargaining rights and education.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      But in Wisconsin, where November’s election brought one of the most significant flips from Democrats to Republicans, a week of negotiations clearly had fallen apart by Monday, and blame was being spread everywhere. The opposing sides traded pointed letters, which they shared with the news media. They traded conflicting versions of who had tried to talk to whom about what.      By midday on Monday, Mr. Walker, who has been governor since January, described an early-morning request from Mr. Miller, the leader of the Senate Democrats, for a resumption of discussions somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border as “ridiculous.”      At a news conference where he was flanked by Senator Fitzgerald and Jeff Fitzgerald, the Republican speaker of the State Assembly (and the brother of Senator Fitzgerald), Governor Walker described to reporters his view of negotiations in recent days. After talks last Wednesday with several Democrats at a McDonald’s in Kenosha, not far from the Illinois border, Mr. Walker’s aides had been buoyed by the possibility of a substantive deal, Mr. Walker said, only to have Mr. Miller “firmly standing in the way.”      The Republicans said that the Democrats were divided over the negotiations, and that leadership was murky at best. The Democrats, meanwhile, said Governor Walker had shown little real interest in shifting from his position that curtailing collective bargaining was needed to solve the state’s budget woes.      Mr. Walker’s proposal would make changes to most public sector unions, limiting collective bargaining only to matters of wages and limiting raises to the Consumer Price Index.      The Democrats left the state on Feb. 17, the day that a Senate vote was expected on Mr. Walker’s measure. ||||| Playing a game of political chicken, Democratic senators who fled Wisconsin to stymie restrictions on public-employee unions said Sunday they planned to come back from exile soon, betting that even though their return will allow the bill to pass, the curbs are so unpopular they'll taint the state's Republican governor and legislators.      The Republicans rejected the idea that the legislation would hurt the GOP. \\"If you think this is a bad bill for Republicans, why didn't you stand up in the chamber and debate us about it three weeks ago?\\" said Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. \\"People think it's absolutely ridiculous that these 14 senators have not been in Wisconsin for three weeks.\\"      Getty Images Protests continued Sunday at the state capitol in Madison.      The Wisconsin standoff, which drew thousands of demonstrators to occupy the capitol in Madison for days at a time, has come to highlight efforts in other states to address budget problems in part by limiting the powers and benefits accorded public-sector unions.      Sen. Mark Miller said he and his fellow Democrats intend to let the full Senate vote on Gov. Scott Walker's \\"budget-repair\\" bill, which includes the proposed limits on public unions' collective-bargaining rights. The bill, which had been blocked because the missing Democrats were needed for the Senate to have enough members present to vote on it, is expected to pass the Republican-controlled chamber.      He said he thinks recent polls showing voter discontent with Mr. Walker over limits on bargaining rights have been \\"disastrous\\" for the governor and Republicans and give Democrats more leverage to seek changes in a broader two-year budget bill Mr. Walker proposed Tuesday.      In a letter sent Monday, Mr. Miller asked Messrs. Walker and Fitzgerald for an in-person meeting somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border.      Before Sunday's developments, Mr. Walker said he wouldn't be swayed by the polls. \\"If I governed by polls I'd still be in the state Assembly,\\" Mr. Walker said on Friday. \\"I won reelection twice as county executive in an area of the state that went two-thirds for President Obama by identifying a problem, telling people how I was going to deal with it, and then moving forward with the solution.\\"      Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for the governor, said Sunday that Mr. Walker \\"looks forward to the Senate Democrats returning as soon as possible.\\"      Mr. Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said Sunday that the \\"budget repair\\" bill can't be amended at this point. But it's possible that over the next few weeks adjustments could be made to Mr. Walker's broader budget plan, he said. \\"This bill will pass. The collective-bargaining piece has to pass. If it doesn't the governor's budget doesn't work,\\" he said.

Video courtesy of NewsCore.      Mr. Miller declined to say how soon the Democratic senators, who left for Illinois on Feb. 17, would return. He said the group needed to address several issues first—including the resolution Senate Republicans passed last week that holds the Democrats in contempt and orders police to detain them when they return to Wisconsin.      Amid the public demonstrations and Democratic walk-out, the two sides have been negotiating. Mr. Fitzgerald said the governor is negotiating through two staff members with two Democrats, Sen. Bob Jauch and Sen. Tim Cullen. And last week, Mr. Fitzgerald met ago with Mr. Jauch and another Democrat in Kenosha.      Mr. Jauch said some people have suggested the lawmakers remain in Illinois for months while recall efforts of Republican senators proceed. He said that would be difficult for one senator who is seven months pregnant.      \\"I think we have to realize that there's only so much we can do as a group to make a stand,\\" Mr. Jauch said. \\"It's really up to the public to be engaged in carrying the torch on this issue.\\"      Brad Lutes, president of a local teachers union in Sun Prairie, Wis., said having Democrats return without getting bargaining curbs removed from the bill \\"would hurt,\\" but added, \\"I think they've done an awful lot being out as long as they have. It's really given the people of Wisconsin an opportunity to see both sides of an issue.\\"      Protesters were allowed back inside the Captiol Friday, but with some strict rules. Video courtesy of Fox Television Stations.      Mr. Walker's bill would prohibit bargaining over health care and pensions for about 170,000 public employees in the state and would allow public employees to opt out of paying dues or belonging to a union.      The bill also would end the automatic collection of dues by the state, and require that every public-employee union get recertified to represent workers through an annual election.      Mr. Miller said the Democrats also want to fight Mr. Walker's recently announced two-year budget plan, which cuts spending by 4.2 billion, or 6.7%, including 1.25 billion less in state aid to schools and local governments.      As the standoff in Wisconsin has dragged on, several polls showed majorities of Wisconsin voters disapproving of Mr. Walker's plan as it affects public employees. At the same time, the governor maintains strong support among Republicans. He also has significant backing from voters for his plan to have union members pay more out of their salaries toward their pensions and health care. A poll released Friday by Rasmussen Reports, based on a phone survey conducted March 2 of 800 likely Wisconsin voters, found 52% of them opposed weakening collective-bargaining rights, while 39% were in favor.      When asked whether state workers should take a 10% pay cut—roughly the equivalent of the governor's plan—44% supported the move and 38% were opposed.      A poll by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, which calls itself the state's \\"free-market think tank,\\" showed that more voters, particularly independents, disapproved of the governor than in a similar survey by the institute in November. Republican voters' support remained basically unchanged from the fall. The poll was based on phone interviews of 603 Wisconsin residents and conducted Feb. 27-March 1. Both polls had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.      WSJ/NBC News Poll Poll Shows Budget-Cuts Dilemma      The results of both polls were echoed in a recent poll by The Wall Street Journal / NBC News, which found that 62% of Americans oppose efforts to strip unionized government workers of their rights to collectively bargain, even as they want public employees to contribute more money to their retirement and health-care benefits. The poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 adults, conducted from Feb. 24-28, by the polling organizations of Peter D. Hart and Bill McInturff.      Mark Jefferson, head of the Wisconsin GOP, said polls reflected the big campaign unions have launched in the state. \\"The millions of dollars in national union money for advertising have been effective at getting the union message out,\\" he said.      He said even after Mr. Walker's plan is passed, the state's public workers will still have more collective-bargaining rights than most federal workers, who can bargain over working conditions but not pay and benefits.      Several big public-sector unions in Wisconsin have already said they would agree to fiscal concessions in Mr. Walker's bill, including contributing 5.8% out of their pay to pensions and 12.6% of healthcare premiums out of their wages, up from 6% on average today. But they object to ending bargaining rights and other changes.

Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

The right side of the equation is represented by the variable \\"p.\\" Our goal is to determine the value of p that satisfies the equation. Let's break down the left side of the equation: -5 is a negative integer that is located five units to the left of 0 on the number line. 0 is an integer and represents no value or the starting point on the number line. When we add 0 to any number, the value remains unchanged. In other words, the identity property of addition states that any number added to zero will result in that same number. Mathematically, this is represented as: n + 0 = n, where n represents any number. Now, let's apply this property to the given equation: -5 + 0 = p Since -5 is our value for n, we add zero to -5: -5 + 0 = -5 So, the equation becomes: -5 = p This result indicates that p is equal to -5, which means the solution for the given equation -5 + 0 = p is p = -5."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A room that is painted red will energize, inspire activity and movement, help passion, and be powerful and stimulating. A red room can also be exhausting and overpowering, and stressful for those who are anxious. Orange rooms encourage happy, joyful, social gatherings. While an orange dining room or family room can stimulate the appetite, it is a great choice for such gathering places. Orange enhances parties, communication, positive feelings, and general good cheer. Yellow rooms inspire intellectual clarity, organization, clear -headed thinking, and happy energy. Yellow is considered a color for the logical left side of the brain. Yellow is also very bright and somewhat energizing. Blue rooms are often chosen for bedrooms and meditation rooms because its cool energy is very calming, restful, peaceful, and spiritual. Blue helps inspire a quiet meditative quality, and color therapy with blue has been found to reduce blood pressure. Blue is also useful to make one to sleep.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"This sentence provides various pieces of information that can be extracted, analyzed, and further investigated. Here is a breakdown of the data that can be garnered from this sentence: 1. Location Data:    a. Albany, Oregon: The sentence identifies Albany as a city within the state of Oregon in the United States of America. Albany is likely to have its own unique geographical, demographic, and historical attributes as a city.    b. Oregon: This state is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and has its own landmarks, tourist spots, history, and population statistics. By mentioning Oregon, one could infer information about the general climate, industries, and cultural characteristics of the state.    c. United States of America (U.S.A.): As the sentence refers to the country, it is essential to consider the broader national context. This includes information about federal policies, national trends, cultural diversity, major events, and other factors affecting the country as a whole. 2. Demographic Data:    a. Ethnic Group: Asian Americans are mentioned as one of the country's ethnic groups. Ethnic groups are important aspects of demographic analysis, as they can offer insights into cultural diversity, historical migration patterns, and social integration.    b. Asian Americans: The sentence specifies that Asian Americans are an ethnic group present in the United States. This refers to people of Asian origin or descent, and can be further broken down into diverse subcategories based on nationality, ethnicity, or culture (e.g., Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, etc.). The presence of Asian Americans in the country provides valuable information about immigration history, cultural influences, and the makeup of the national population. 3. Implications for Further Analysis:    The sentence offers a starting point for various lines of inquiry and deeper analysis, such as:    a. Demographics of Albany: One could investigate the demographic composition of Albany, including statistics on population size, age distributions, income levels, education attainment, and more.    b. Ethnic Composition of Albany: A closer look at the ethnic composition of Albany, especially the percentage of Asian Americans, could reveal statistical insights about the city's diversity and cultural background.    c. Comparison with Other Oregon Cities: One could also compare Albany's demographic and ethnic makeup with those of other cities in Oregon, or even with the state as a whole, to identify trends and unique characteristics.    d. History of Asian American Migration to Albany: Understanding the historical context of Asian American settlement in Albany could provide insights into how the city has evolved and how it relates to broader migration patterns in the country.    e. Public Policies and Community Engagement: Consideration of public policies, initiatives, and resources related to the integration and support of ethnic minorities, specifically Asian Americans, within Albany may reveal important local efforts or challenges. In summary, the sentence referencing Albany as a city in Oregon, U.S.A., with Asian Americans as one of the country's ethnic groups, provides a wealth of data that, upon extraction, can be further investigated and analyzed to better understand the city's demographic diversity, history, and place within the larger American context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: A tent is the most common source of shelter used when camping.  If you haven’t set up your tent before, set it up in your yard once or twice before you arrive at your campsite to get some practice. Tents come in many different sizes.  If you’re camping alone, you could get a small, single-person tent.  If you’re camping with someone else, get a tent that accommodates both of you. If you plan on going hiking or climbing during your camping trip, you’ll want a backpack.  The size of the pack you decide to bring depends on how far you’ll be hiking.  Longer, more intense hikes will require a larger and sturdier backpack, while easier day hikes will only require a small day pack.  Backpacks are either frameless, or have an internal or external frame.  Internal frame packs tend to be more expensive and sit flush against your back. External frame packs are more affordable and tend to provide more ventilation.  However, they are bulkier than internal frame packs. Smaller day packs that don’t hold much are usually frameless. A sturdy rope has lots of uses when camping.  You can use it as a clothesline, or cut it into various lengths in order to hang pots or bind your sleeping pad to your backpack. You'll want to store and coil your rope correctly when you pack it to avoid tangling. A tarp can provide additional protection for the bottom of your tent, or it can be stretched over your tent to keep it extra-dry.  The size of the tarp you get depends on the size of your tent.  The larger your tent, the larger the tarp you bring along. A battery-powered flashlight or headlamp is important for helping you find your way around your campsite after dark. Headlamps can be useful to complete tasks around your campsite, as your hands will be free.  Be sure to pack extra batteries. You might also want to bring a battery-powered lantern. Collapsible camping chairs are perfect for sitting around the fire or just lounging around the campsite.  The best camping chairs are lightweight and sold in specialty backpacking stores. If you’re camping with a group, advise each person in your party to bring a foldable camping chair of their own. Summary:","output":"When camping, a tent is a crucial shelter, with sizes varying based on the number of campers. Practice setting up the tent beforehand. Backpacks are necessary for hiking, with size and type determined by hike length and intensity. Ropes serve multiple purposes, but proper storage is essential. Tarps add extra protection for tents, sized according to the tent. Flashlights or headlamps are vital for nighttime navigation, along with extra batteries. Collapsible camping chairs provide seating, each camper bringing their own lightweight chair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

The guidelines could be used to discriminate based on religion and/or national origin. Human rights groups are protesting the proposed guidelines for extreme vetting because they believe that these guidelines could be used to discriminate based on religion and/or national origin. The U.S. State Department's directives to identify certain groups for extra scrutiny when applying for visas and to review social media accounts of visa applicants suspected of terrorist ties or having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas have raised concerns among rights groups and critics. These critics, including Amnesty International, argue that the measures can potentially be used as a tool for discrimination based on national origin and religion. They also contend that these guidelines are discriminatory against Muslims, given that President Trump's travel ban, which has been suspended, targeted travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. While the extreme vetting process proposed by the Trump administration includes questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses, and travel history going back 15 years and all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years, these guidelines have not been cited as the main reasons behind the protests from human rights groups.

I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late! I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me. \\"I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason.\\" \\"What do you mean? I'm telling the truth.\\" Dad looked at me again. \\"When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car.\\" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently  as a sadness passed through him. \\"I'm angry, not with you but with myself.

In the story, the father's reaction to his son's explanation was not anger directed at the son, but rather towards himself. He felt that he had failed as a father because he had raised a son who felt the need to lie to him. The father's disappointment in himself and his parenting shows his understanding that it's important to foster a trusting and open relationship with his child. Hearing his son's confession filled him with sadness, as he realized the weight of his responsibility in shaping his son's values and behavior. When the father expressed his feelings to his son, it showed the depth of their relationship and the importance of honesty and trust between them. By sharing his disappointment and choosing to walk home, the father allowed his son to observe the consequences of his actions and the impact lies can have on relationships.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF) was the military aviation service of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II, successor to the United States Army Air Corps and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force. The AAF were a component of the United States Army, which in 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff.  - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\".  - The Enola Gay is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, named for Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets, who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb. The bomb, code-named \\"Little Boy\\", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. \\"Enola Gay\\" participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura.

It was one of the largest aircraft operational during World War II and featured state of the art technology. It was the single most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, exceeding the cost of the Manhattan Project by between 1 and 1.7 billion dollars. Innovations introduced included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a remote, computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer. A manned tail gun installation was semi-remote. The name \\"Superfortress\\" continued the pattern Boeing started with its well-known predecessor, the B-17 Flying Fortress.

On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly.  and a hint : Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off.  Please answer this question : Which balloon is less likely to take off, balloon A or balloon B? A:","output":"Balloon A is less likely to take off because it is flat. This indicates that the air pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure outside the balloon. In order for a hot air balloon to take off, the air inside needs to be heated, causing the air molecules to move faster, increasing the pressure inside the balloon. This makes the balloon expand and become buoyant, eventually lifting it into the air. Since balloon A is flat, it has not yet been heated and expanded, while balloon B is already inflated and likely closer to being ready for takeoff."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church .  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster.

Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators   became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted   down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill\\" does not logically imply \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\" It is important to analyze both statements individually and then establish their logical relationship if any: Statement 1: One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill. This statement describes a specific scene. There is a single biker who is wearing a black helmet and is currently riding on a dirt hill. The information provided includes details about the biker's helmet color (black) as well as his/her location and activity (riding on a dirt hill). Statement 2: A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass. This statement also describes a specific scene. In this case, there is a biker wearing an orange helmet and is riding in the grass. Similar to the first statement, this provides information about the biker's helmet color (orange), location, and activity (riding in the grass). Now, to determine if there is a logical relationship between these two statements, we should consider if Statement 2 is a direct or indirect consequence of Statement 1, or if they are mutually exclusive or independent.  Direct Consequence: Statement 2 would be a direct consequence of Statement 1 if the information in Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 must also be true. In this case, there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements, and Statement 2 is not a direct consequence of Statement 1. Indirect Consequence: Statement 2 would be an indirect consequence of Statement 1 if a combination of additional information (including background knowledge) and Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 is true. In this case, the two statements describe two distinct scenes, both involving bikers wearing different helmet colors and riding in different locations. There is no information in the first statement that suggests that it would lead to the second statement or vice versa. Mutually Exclusive: The two statements would be mutually exclusive if the truth of one statement would imply the falsity of the other. However, the two statements describe different bikers, as indicated by the different helmet colors, so the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily mean that the other is false. Therefore, the statements are not mutually exclusive. Independent: Finally, the two statements can be considered independent if the truth or falsity of one statement has no effect on the other statement's validity. In this case, both statements involve bikers who are wearing different helmet colors and riding in different places. Each statement describes its scene without any specific relationship between the two. Therefore, they can be viewed as independent statements. In conclusion, the statement \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill\\" does not logically imply \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\" The two statements appear to be independent, describing different individuals wearing different helmet colors, participating in separate activities in different locations. There is no direct or indirect constraint between them, and they are not mutually exclusive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bhajans are devotional songs that usually convey a spiritual message or theme. They are sung traditionally in a group setting or individually.

Bhajans often include a chorus and verses, and may come from a large variety of sources, like poems, ancient scriptures, or the works of saint-poets. 2.

Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren.  - In the Christian gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was \\"about 30 years of age\\" at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at around AD 2729 and the end in the range AD 3036. Jesus' \\"Early Galilean ministry\\" begins when after his Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. BRIDGEPORT, Conn. --A missing Connecticut man texted his son the day he vanished that he was worried about being set up for murder, according to a criminal complaint obtained by 48 Hours' Crimesider charging the son with a federal gun offense.      Fifty-six-year-old Jeffrey Navin and his wife, 55-year-old Jeanette Navin of Easton haven't been seen since Aug. 4, and the mystery of their disappearance has garnered national headlines. Their car was found in a commuter lot off the Merritt Parkway in Westport Aug. 9 by state troopers, according to Connecticut State Police, reportedly with a smashed window.      Police said they learned that the couple owed more than 2 million, much of it tied to a home in Guilford. But relatives have denied that the debt was related to their disappearance. Searches of landfills in the area have turned up no trace of human remains.      Their son Kyle Navin, 27, appeared in federal court in Bridgeport Monday afternoon on a charge of possession of a firearm by an individual who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance. Kyle Navin was questioned by investigators following his parents' disappearance, and state police spent hours searching his Bridgeport home, reported CBS affiliate WFSB. Police have called him a \\"person of interest\\" in the case, according to the station.      He has not been charged in connection to the disappearance.      A federal affidavit in support of the gun charge reveals new details about the last known activities of Jeanette and Jeffrey Navin and Kyle Navin's statements to investigators, some of which allegedly don't match evidence collected by investigators. It also details items uncovered during the search of Kyle Navin's home -- allegedly including two firearms, numerous rounds of ammunition, prescription bottles for Xanax and Oxycodone, hypodermic needles and glassine bags with apparent heroin residue -- and outlines cell phone records.      According to the complaint, released by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, Kyle and Jeffrey Navin exchanged text messages between 11:40 a.m. and 1:14 p.m. on the day Jeffrey and his wife disappeared. Jeffrey Navin allegedly texted his son, \\"I'm not going home till I know mom is okay\\" and \\"Did you hurt mom?\\" to which the younger Navin replied, \\"No absolutely not. Why would you think\\"      Jeffrey Navin allegedly texted back, \\"I go home and get framed for murder\\" and \\"I'm going to the police first.\\" Later, according to the complaint, the elder Navin texted his son, \\"UR setting me up.\\"      The exchange stands in contrast to the younger Navin's statement to investigators that he only discussed work with his father the day he disappeared, the complaint alleges. Kyle Navin worked for the family business, J & J Refuse, a Westport-based trash removal and recycling collection service. The company's website listed Jeffrey Navin as the president and Kyle Navin as its operations manager.      The couple was reported missing Aug. 7 by Jeffrey Navin's brother William, who co-owns the refuse company, according to the complaint. William Navin told Easton Police Jeffrey Navin hadn't shown up for work, which was unusual, he said, because he never missed work without making arrangements to have his refuse pickup route covered.      According to the complaint, Kyle Navin was interviewed by law enforcement three times -- on Aug. 9 and Aug. 11 at the Easton Police Department and Aug. 13 at the Connecticut State Police barracks in Bridgeport. He allegedly told investigators on Aug. 9 that he last spoke with his father \\"sometime around noon\\" Aug. 4 when his father called to ask about a new customer. He said his parents often went away on short trips, but acknowledged it was unusual for his father to miss work.      On Aug. 11, Kyle Navin allegedly told investigators that he met his mother on the morning of Aug. 4, at the park and ride near Exit 42 on the Merritt Parkway, and that his mother got into his garbage truck and they collected refuse along his usual route. He said his back started hurting between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., so he called his father and arranged to meet him at a nursery, where his mother got into his father's truck around 10:30 a.m, according to the complaint. Kyle Navin said he drove back to his home in Bridgeport and remained there until around 12:30, when he drove to his parents' home in Easton to pick up a paycheck his father had left taped to the door before returning to Bridgeport.      He allegedly said he spent the next three days at his home because of his back injury.      Interviewed again at the state police barracks on Aug. 13, Kyle Navin repeated the story, but this time also told investigators that he returned to his home around 9:20 a.m. Aug. 4 with his mother. He allegedly said he needed to pick up paperwork delineating his refuse route for his mother, because he had asked her to complete his route for the day.      Kyle Navin \\"denied discussing any issue related to his mother or her safety\\" on the phone with his father that day, according to the complaint.      Jeanette Navin's cellphone last registered at a cell tower near her son's home at 9:20 a.m. Aug. 4, according to the complaint -- her husband's last call was placed the same day around 1:23 p.m. and accessed the same cell tower. At both times, Kyle Navin's phone also pinged off the same cell tower, the complaint says.      Investigators also outline an interview with Kyle Navin's girlfriend, who allegedly told them Kyle asked her to follow him in her car to his parents' house in Easton as Kyle drove his father's truck. The woman said Kyle parked his father's car at the Easton house and the two returned to Bridgeport together in her car. The movement of the two vehicles was captured on security cameras, according to the complaint.      In searching Kyle Navin's home based on the cell records and surveillance footage, the complaint says investigators uncovered a Home Depot receipt issued Aug. 5 indicating Kyle Navin purchased \\"germicidal bleach, hair/grease drain opener, 'Goo Gone' stain remover and contractor cleanup bags.\\"      In a search of his cellphone, investigators uncovered texts between Kyle Navin and his girlfriend about doing drugs, the complaint alleges. When investigators asked the woman about guns uncovered in the home, she allegedly told investigators Kyle \\"really likes his gun\\" and carries it often.      Investigators interviewed an unidentified person who appeared to be contacting Kyle Navin in order to buy Oxycodone, according to the complaint -- Kyle allegedly told the person Aug. 5 \\"he was dealing with a lot of family issues and that it looked like his parents were missing,\\" though he told police he first learned of the disappearance from his uncle Aug. 6.      Reached by phone Tuesday, Kyle Navin's lawyer Eugene Riccio had no comment on the allegations outlined in the complaint. He said his client is in federal custody and a detention hearing will be set for later in the week.      The federal gun charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut. Kyle Navin hasn't yet entered a plea, Riccio said. ||||| Kyle Navin, the son of the Easton couple who have been missing since Aug. 4, is being held on federal gun charges after his arrest Tuesday, and startling new details found in the arrest affidavit further deepen the mystery surrounding his parents' disappearance.      Navin was detained after appearing in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport. He was charged with possession of a firearm by an individual who is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance.      In an Aug. 4 text-message conversation, detailed in a 15-page FBI arrest warrant, Navin's father, Jeffrey, asked his son if he hurt his mother, Jeanette Navin. This is part of the conversation between Kyle Navin, 27, and his father that investigators found on Kyle's phone:      12:39 p.m., Jeffrey: I'm not going home till I know mom is okay.      12:42 p.m., Jeffrey: Did you hurt mom?      12:43 p.m., Kyle: No absolutely not. Why would you think      12:44 p.m., Jeffrey: I go home and get framed for murder      12:45 p.m., Kyle: Oh stop      12:48 p.m., Jeffrey: I'm going to the police first      12:50 p.m., Kyle: Ok and reason being?      12:57 p.m., Jeffrey: U R setting me up      12:58 p.m., Kyle: Dad really what are you talking about?      Kyle Navin has not been charged in his parents' disappearance. Navin's lawyer declined comment after the court appearance.      The affidavit says the text conversation between Kyle and Jeffrey Navin led investigators to search Kyle Navin's Bridgeport home. It then details the findings of drugs, weapons and ammunition at the home.      In addition, police discovered a receipt from Home Depot that was issued on Aug. 5 at 8:36 p.m. The receipt showed that Kyle Navin purchased germicidal bleach, hair and grease drain opener, Goo Gone stain remover and contractor cleanup bags.

Riccio, the lawyer for Kyle Navin, the son of the missing Easton couple, was seen leaving court Tuesday after defending Navin on gun charges. See more videos      Written by FBI Special Agent Michael Zuk, the affidavit also states that \\"the cell phone activity and text messages between (Kyle) Navin and Jeffrey (Navin) on August 4, 2015 do not accord with (Kyle) Navin's statements to law enforcement.\\"      Investigators have examined the cellphone records of all three Navins. They determined that the last time Jeanette's phone was used was at 9:20 a.m. on Aug. 4 near Park Avenue in Bridgeport. The last time Jeffrey's cellphone was turned on was 1:23 p.m. on the same day from the same area in Bridgeport, records show.      On Aug. 4, the affidavit states, security cameras in Easton captured a video of someone driving Jeffrey's garbage truck on Center Road. The camera caught Kyle Navin's girlfriend's vehicle following closely behind the truck.      Approximately 29 minutes later the same video camera showed the girlfriend driving the opposite way on Center Road away from the Navins' house. Jeffrey's garbage truck was found at the house when police went there on Aug. 7, the document indicates.      When state police interviewed the girlfriend she initially \\"lied,\\" until confronted with the video, the affidavit said. She then admitted to following Kyle Navin back to his parents' house and giving him a ride home to Bridgeport. The affidavit said the girlfriend \\"could offer no reason as to why or how Jeffrey's truck came to be in Bridgeport or why Kyle Navin needed to drive it back to Easton.\\"      Jeffrey Navin is the president of J&J Refuse in Westport. Jeanette Navin works for the Weston school system. Kyle Navin works for the refuse company.      Jeffrey's truck was found near Exit 42 off the Merritt Parkway in Westport by a state police trooper on routine patrol on Aug. 9. The passenger's side window was smashed and police found a \\"physiological fluid\\" on the floor mat, police sources have said.      On Aug. 9, according to the affidavit, Kyle Navin told investigators he last saw his parents on Aug. 4 at work. Two days later, the document says, Kyle Navin again spoke with investigators.      \\"This time\\" he told investigators he met his mother at a parking lot near Exit 42, the document states. He said his mother got into his garbage truck and \\"that he and his mother went to collect garbage along his usual route.\\" He told investigators he dropped his mother off at a nursery near the exit where they met his father. Jeanette Navin got into Jeffrey Navin's truck at that point, Kyle Navin told investigators.      Kyle Navin told investigators he went to his Bridgeport home before driving to his parent's home in Easton to pick up his paycheck, which his father taped to the door. He went back home and remained there for the majority of the next three days, he said.      On Aug. 13, the affidavit indicates, Kyle Navin told police he met both his parents at the parking lot on the morning of Aug. 4. He told investigators he could not finish his garbage route because of back pain. He said that because his mother did not know his route, he drove her to his Bridgeport home to get paperwork that showed the route. They drove back to Westport, where Jeneatte got out of his truck and into Jeffrey's, he told investigators.      He told investigators that the only other contact he had that day with his parents was \\"telephonic contact with his father that related solely to work.\\" Sources said that Kyle Navin has refused to take a polygraph test when questioned by state police detectives.      Investigators searched Navin's Bridgeport home on Aug. 13. They seized two firearms and rounds of ammunition from Navin's bedroom, the arrest affidavit unsealed Tuesday indicates. A second search, on Aug. 19, uncovered brand-stamped glassine baggies with heroin residue, hypodermic needles, empty prescription bottles for oxycodone and prescription bottles containing other controlled substances, the affidavit indicates.      A court-authorized search of Navin's cellphone revealed text messages that discuss his use of heroin, oxycodone and Xanax, the complaint alleges. The charge carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison.      The affidavit states that an unidentified person told investigators they talked to Kyle Navin on Aug. 5 about buying oxycodone from him and that Kyle Navin told the buyer that \\"it looked like his parents were missing.\\" That affidavit notes that conversation took place one day before \\"(Kyle) Navin allegedly first learned from his uncle that Jeffrey had not shown up for work on August 6, 2015.\\"      A family member reported the Navins missing on Aug. 7 after Jeffrey Navin failed to pick up the garbage on his route for two days. In a search of the couple's Easton home police discovered a to-do list on the refrigerator, including such tasks as unplugging the dehumidifier and turning off all the lights. Police noted it seemed to be a list of things to do before taking a trip, the affidavit said.      Neither of the Navins' phones has been used since Aug. 4, and their bank accounts have been untouched, law enforcement records indicate. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A man named Jeffrey Navin and his wife Jeanette disappeared in Connecticut a while ago.

Movie title: Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam Context: The film opens with a young couple sitting in their car on a hillside outside of the city as an apparent meteor streaks across the sky and smashes into the couple's car. It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to meet with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees some bullies mugging a homeless man. After attempting to defend the man, Billy himself receives a black eye. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, calling him \\"The Captain\\". Billy tells him that he always tries to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only thing of value he has â a subway token. At the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfasts, and tells him he wants to write a story to bring his plight, and those in his same situation, to public light. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering outside the diner. He claps his hands together, blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and quickly changes into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy does not know what he means. Black Adam picks up a fire engine to smash Billy, but Superman intervenes and blocks the blow. While Billy makes good his escape, Superman gets a blast of electricity from Black Adam. After recovering he realizes Adam's powers are magically based, and he is vulnerable. This vulnerability puts Superman and Adam at an equal footing.

Next question: what is a cross between a lion and tiger called?","output":"A cross between a lion and a tiger is called a liger. Ligers are hybrid offspring resulting from the mating of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). This fascinating interbreeding between two species of large cats creates a unique creature that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. Ligers are currently the largest known felines in the world, having a combination of the genetic traits of both lions and tigers. These hybrid animals typically surpass the size of their parent species, with males weighing around 900-1,200 pounds and females ranging between 700-900 pounds. In terms of length, some adult male ligers can reach up to 11-12 feet. Ligers have a mixed appearance, possessing physical features of both lions and tigers. Their fur usually resembles that of a lion, varying from a tawny to sandy yellow color, with faint spots and stripes that come from their tiger parentage. The stripes are generally not as bold as those seen in tigers and might fade as the liger matures. Male ligers often have a mane, although it is typically shorter and less dense than a lion's mane, and some may even have a beard on their chin similar to that of their lion forebears. Additionally, like tigers, ligers are fond of swimming, which is not common among lions. In terms of behavior, ligers appear to display traits from both parent species. They can be social animals, like lions, and can also exhibit the more solitary nature of tigers. Their vocalizations are a mix of the lion's roar and the tiger's chuff or growl. It is important to note that ligers are not found in the wild, as the territories of lions and tigers do not overlap in their natural habitats. Ligers exist only due to human intervention and breeding in captivity. The hybrid counterpart of a liger, called a tigon, results from the mating of a male tiger and a female lion. Tigons, however, don't generally grow as large as ligers and exhibit a combination of physical and behavioral traits from their parent species. The subject of breeding ligers and other hybrid animals is controversial, as taking part in it may involve significant ethical and conservation concerns. Some critics argue that it can contribute to health problems in the offspring, including genetic defects, reduced lifespan, and infertility. Additionally, conservationists emphasize that resources should be focused on preserving natural habitats and protecting endangered species rather than creating and maintaining hybrids. Although ligers draw curiosity and fascination among many individuals, it is crucial to consider the challenges and implications that such hybrid breeding may have on the animals' wellbeing and overall conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open.\\", can we conclude \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\"?","output":"Based on the provided description, \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open,\\" it is highly unlikely, in fact almost impossible, to conclude that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\"  Here's why: 1. Animal Recognition: Dogs and dinosaurs, despite both being animals, are fundamentally different. A dog is a mammal, commonly domesticated and kept as a pet with a variety of breeds and appearances. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, are a group of reptiles that existed millions of years ago with phenotypes vastly different from modern dogs. The distinction between the physical characteristics of dogs and dinosaurs is stark, making it hard to mistake one for the other based on visual evidence. 2. Time Frame: Another important factor is the time frame of each species. Dinosaurs went extinct approximately 65 million years ago. On the other hand, dogs have been man's best friend for thousands of years and are alive presently. Therefore, the likelihood of having a picture of a living, breathing dinosaur is non-existent based on what we know.  3. Evolution: In connection to the time frame, due to evolution processes, modern dogs evolved from wolves through selective breeding by humans, whereas dinosaurs have no direct descendants alive today in the form we know them but evolved into birds. 4. Description Given: The description given explicitly states that the photo is a \\"Closeup of a dog in profile with mouth open.\\" There is no mention of a dinosaur. It is crucial to stick to the facts presented without making unfounded assumptions. 5. Photography and Fossils: Dinosaurs thrived in an era before humans and more so before the invention of photography. Hence, the only visuals we have of dinosaurs are either archaeological remains, which typically include bones and fossils, or artistic renditions based on scientific research. These would look much different than a closeup shot of a dog with its mouth open. In conclusion, the description provided does not lend itself to the conclusion that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\" Rather, it clearly indicates an image of a dog, which is an entirely different species with a distinct set of physical and biological characteristics. So, without additional context or evidence, it would not be reasonable to deduce that a photo depicting a dog is actually that of a dinosaur. Asserting such would require overlooking a vast amount of evidence to the contrary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people, experts said today. Their new study found real acupuncture using needles and lasers was no more helpful than sham acupuncture. It specifically looked at the effects of acupuncture on chronic knee pain in people aged 50 or over. Rana Hinman, lead author from the University of Melbourne, said the team of researchers were surprised at their results. She said: 'It is surprising that our study showed acupuncture was not effective compared to sham acupuncture, because many people with chronic knee pain report that treatment with acupuncture is beneficial for their symptoms.' Scientists in Australia found acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people. File photo. Previous studies has found acupuncture is effective, although the benefits compared to mock acupuncture have been generally small and of questionable benefit, she said. Her team found many people over the age of 50 are plagued with chronic knee pain, and many turn to alternative treatments, including acupuncture. Acupuncturists often use a combination of traditional Chinese and Western techniques with needles and low-intensity lasers. But the effectiveness of laser acupuncture has been questioned, the researchers said. To test whether needle or laser acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture, the scientists divided 282 patients over the age of 50 with chronic knee pain and morning stiffness into four groups. The knee pain targeted in the study is common with osteoarthritis - the result of normal joint wear and tear over the years. One group received no acupuncture at all. Another received needle acupuncture, another laser acupuncture, while the last group received sham laser acupuncture. Patients received eight to 12 treatments over three months. Each treatment session lasted about 20 minutes. The laser and sham laser treatments looked the same to both patients and acupuncturists, but the laser was not turned on for the sham group. The patients rated their average knee pain and physical function on questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after three months of treatment and again at one year. There were 'modest improvements' in pain at three months in the needle and laser acupuncture groups compared to the no-treatment group, but not compared to the sham group. Researchers looked at the effects of laser acupuncture, pictured, and needle treatment on 282 patients. File picture. And there were no differences between any of the groups on measures of knee pain and function after one year. This suggests that there were no 'real' or 'direct' effects of needle or laser acupuncture, Dr Hinman said. The improvements patients felt were likely due to the placebo effect. 'Acupuncture tends to be more effective for people who believe in the benefits of acupuncture,' she said. 'In our study, people did not know that were signing up for an acupuncture study, so our participants were less likely to be 'believers' in acupuncture, which probably explains why acupuncture was ineffective in our study.' The new results are very similar to those of a review of individual patient data in 2012, said Andrew Vickers. Dr Vickers, who led the previous review, is an attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and was not involved in the new study. The new review may have found a benefit from real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture if the study included more people, he said. 'About three million Americans try acupuncture per year, and chronic pain is the most common indication,' he said. People with chronic pain should see a pain specialist, as there are many options for treatment, including acupuncture, he said. 'As the authors suggest, the findings of this study are applicable to patients with moderate to severe persistent knee pain, and acupuncture may be effective in some people with neuropathic (nerve related) pain,' said Dr. Abhishek Abhishek, an arthritis researcher and associate professor at the University of Nottingham. The UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Health does not recommend acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis, but does recommend it for persistent low back pain as it can be effective in that scenario, Dr Abhishek, who was not part of the new study, said. As alternatives to acupuncture, Dr Hinman said physical therapy, knee braces and exercise can all help alleviate chronic knee pain. The new study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Highlights:","output":"1.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Below is a quick look at what Obama said Wednesday -- a few hours before he spoke to the public at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate -- on European concerns about U.S. surveillance programs, Russia's disagreement with the United States over Syria, and more: 1) Germany still leery about U.S. surveillance There have been some reports here in OPTIONS: - Afghanistan that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - America that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Angela Merkel that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Barack Obama that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Berlin that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Brandenburg Gate that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - CNN that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - European that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - G8 that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - German that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Germany that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Merkel that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Northern Ireland that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Obama that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Russia that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Syria that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - U.S. that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - United States that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said.","output":"The correct ending to the passage would be: \\"Germany that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said.  This sentence makes sense because it refers to the reports in Germany, the place where the talk is happening, where they still have concerns about U.S. surveillance programs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: Kett's Rebellion was a revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. But on 1 August the rebels were defeated by an army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549. Question: How many months after the Rebellion began did Kett get hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle? Answer:","output":"The Rebellion began on 8th July and Robert Kett was hanged on 7th December. So if we count July as the first month, we can say that he was hanged 5 months after the Rebellion began."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – Google unveiled its upgraded search function today called Google Instant, which refines searches as you type by predicting what you're looking for. More details at this \\"user's guide\\" from Search Engine Land, or see the video in the gallery for a demo. Early reaction: Better, but not a world-changer: The best part, writes Stephen Shankland at CNET, is that \\"I could continuously refine my search results as I went. Instead of having to search, check the results, tweak the search, check again, and so on, I could fiddle with the search terms as I went. ... It is for me an improvement, though not a revolution, in search.\\" It's about volume, not speed: \\"Google just found a way to jack up the number of search results you see by doing nothing more than type in a word or two like you always do,\\" writes Erick Schonfeld at TechCrunch. \\"Most people can scan results visually and can absorb a lot more information if it is streamed to them in this fashion rather than having to manually click through to see more results. If people get used to this, it will put pressure on Bing and other search engines to quickly follow suit.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Google Instant: A Step Towards Enhanced Search Experience Google has raised the bar in the search engine domain with the unveiling of its latest innovation, Google Instant, a sophisticated search feature that refines searches by predicting users' query intentions in real-time. The update aims to optimize the user experience by streamlining the search process and allowing users to refine their search queries on the fly. For a complete demonstration and insights, refer to the \\"user's guide\\" provided by Search Engine Land, or check out the video demo in the gallery. The general consensus is that the new feature offers a better search experience, although it may not necessarily redefine the search engine landscape. According to Stephen Shankland at CNET, Google Instant's most significant contribution is its ability to \\"continuously refine my search results as I went. Instead of having to search, check the results, tweak the search, check again, and so on, I could fiddle with the search terms as I went.\\" Though not revolutionary, this innovation notably improves user experience and efficiency in searching for information. Another key aspect of Google Instant is its focus on increasing the volume of search results users can view without compromising search speed. As Erick Schonfeld from TechCrunch points out, \\"Google just found a way to jack up the number of search results you see by doing nothing more than type in a word or two like you always do.\\" This feature enables users to inspect a wider range of search results as information is streamed visually, instead of having to click through each entry. With users potentially adapting to this style of search, rival search engines like Bing might need to follow suit in order to stay competitive. In conclusion, while Google Instant may not be a groundbreaking revolution in the world of search engines, it certainly sets a new standard for user experience and efficiency. With its ability to refine search results in real-time and increase the volume of viewable information, Google Instant is poised to shift user expectations and potentially influence the future development of search engines worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Now that you've learned about the issues and committed yourself to tackling them, it's time to make yourself heard. Start by stating your beliefs about animal rights in influential public forums. For example, sign on to petitions, write letters to decision-makers, and send editorials to newspapers. If there is a hearing about a particular issue, such as the development of wetlands, sign up to give testimony. Animal rights groups need monetary backing to support their good work. Pick an organization that is running campaigns that you believe in and that are garnering measurable results.  Most organizations make it easy to donate by having secure, online tools for making one-time or monthly contributions. If you choose a registered nonprofit, your donations are tax-deductible. Join and/or volunteer with a group that's dedicated to animal rights. Membership usually involves paying dues, attending meetings, being on their contact list, and participating in sponsored events and campaigns.   Check locally to see if there are organizations that are active in your area. If you'd like to get involved with a major player in the cause, here is a helpful online list of the biggest animal rights groups internationally with links to each: https://speakingofresearch.com/extremism-undone/animal-rights-activists-organizations/. If there's a specific issue, such as factory farming or cosmetics testing, that speaks to you, get involved. There are plenty of ways, large and small, to lend a hand.   Some informal ways to get involved include signing a petition, sharing information on social media, or attending a demonstration. Some more formal ways of participating include attending organizing meetings related to the campaign, volunteering your time to a related event or effort, or taking on a leadership role. The best activism takes advantage of the knowledge and experience that you already have. Ask yourself how you can use your education, career, and/or hobbies to help the cause of animal rights.  For instance, if you are an artist, do a show or exhibition that engages the public in the cause. If you're a businessperson, set up a seminar to inform people in the industry about why investing in cruelty-free companies is good business.","output":"The article primarily focuses on how individuals can become engaged in the fight for animal rights and contribute to making a difference in this cause. After understanding the various issues surrounding animal rights and deciding to involve oneself actively, it is crucial to vocalize these beliefs in places where they can wield influence. This can be attained by signing petitions, writing to influential decision-makers, submitting editorials to newspapers, or testifying at relevant hearings. Supporting animal rights organizations financially is another significant way to make an impact. Individuals are encouraged to select groups that align with their ideologies. They should focus on campaigns with proven results. Donations to registered nonprofits also serve as tax deductions, incentivizing this process. These organizations typically provide an easy online tool for making single or monthly contributions that cater to individuals' convenience and preference. Involvement in animal rights groups takes many forms outside monetary contribution. Possibilities include joining as a member, which means paying membership fees, partaking in meetings, registering on their contact list, or participating in their events and campaigns. Volunteering personal time to these groups is another meaningful way to support. It is advisable to explore the local scene for active animal rights organizations or international groups if one desires a broader scope of involvement. The article also provides resources such as an online list of major animal rights groups worldwide, which can be quite helpful for individuals who wish to participate on a global platform.

Finally, the article encourages individuals to use their unique skills and knowledge gained through their education, career, or hobbies towards the cause. For example, artists could host shows to raise awareness, while business individuals could conduct seminars to inform about the advantages of investing in cruelty-free companies.

However, all possible instances based on your options could be explained as follows: 1. Intense Pleasure: The couple could have had an intense pleasure after copulating for so long. Biologically speaking, orgasm is often the peak of sexual intercourse and is experienced as a period of intense pleasure, marked by physiological and psychological release. 2. Period of Rest: Given the phrase \\"seemingly non-stop\\", it would be quite reasonable to suggest that the couple would eventually need a period of rest. Continuous physical activity would undoubtedly require rest eventually, for recovery and replenishment. 3. Babies: One possible outcome of frequent copulation can be conception, which eventually leads to babies. However, pregnancy wouldn't be an immediate result of continuous copulation; it requires a certain combination of factors and appropriate timing in a woman's menstrual cycle. 4. Conversation: After such intense, long-lasting physical intimacy, there could be an emotional deepening of the relationship. This might result in a meaningful conversation, where deeper feelings, future plans, or other significant topics are discussed. 5. Skin Irritation: Continuous copulation could lead to physical discomfort or even skin irritation due to the friction involved. It's highly advisable to prioritize comfort and well-being during such activities.
