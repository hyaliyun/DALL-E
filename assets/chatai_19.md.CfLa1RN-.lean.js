Write some highlights for the following article: The worlds of politics and arts mingled Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with President Barack Obama among those toasting five stars of stage, screen and music. \\"Each of them has been blessed with an extraordinary gift,\\" the president said of the night's honorees. \\"Tonight, we thank them for sharing that gift with us.\\" The festivities in Washington began with a White House reception, where Obama made his remarks flanked by the honorees. People moved from there across town to The Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River for a gala performance. The performing arts space, named in honor of the late President John F. Kennedy, is marking its 40th anniversary this year, and this is the 34th time that it has honored individuals in a \\"celebration of the arts.\\" Past honorees run an entertainment gamut -- from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery in the movie world, to Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan in music, to Ginger Rogers and Mikhail Baryshnikov in dance, among dozens of others. This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and \\"America\\" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website. Legendary saxophonist and composer Sonny Rollins has long stood out on the jazz scene even while playing alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Atlanta-bred musical theater star Barbara Cook made her mark on Broadway. She's also toured the world and produced several studio albums. Yo-Yo Ma -- described in his biography as the nation's \\"cellist-in-chief\\" -- has won 16 Grammy awards over his illustrious career and last year was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sunday night's only non-musical winner is actress Meryl Streep. She burst on the movie scene in 1978 in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" later winning plaudits for her roles in films such as \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" \\"Out of Africa\\" and more recently \\"Julie & Julia.\\" \\"We're just over the moon about this,\\" Cook said of her conversations with the four others about being celebrated Sunday. \\"It's once in a lifetime -- there's nothing else like this.\\" Others attending Sunday's events included actors Stanley Tucci, Robert DeNiro, Sarah Jessica Parker and Emily Blunt, and musician Smokey Robinson. They were joined by political players including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, GOP presidential contender Newt Gingrich, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Several of them -- including DeNiro, Tucci and Robinson -- took the Kennedy Center on Sunday night to celebrate the honorees. Others who spoke included Bill Cosby on behalf of Rollins, Jennifer Nettles and Lionel Ritchie for Diamond, and Stephen Colbert toasting Yo-Yo Ma. A two-hour recap of the gala will air the night of December 27 on CBS. Obama ended his lighthearted remarks Sunday evening with a call for people to support the arts, ideally helping a future Kennedy Center honoree and many others have the tools and opportunities they need to excel. \\"Let's make sure that our young people can dream big dreams and follow them as long as they can go,\\" the president said. That sentiment was seconded on the red carpet by, among others, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \\"The arts are a very good investment because they're about the spirit of America (and) they encourage children to learn, to gain confidence through exercising their creativity,\\" the California Democrat said. \\"Imagination is what keeps us number one.\\"","output":"The Kennedy Center Honors is a special yearly event where important people in arts, like music and acting, are celebrated for their amazing work.

The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994. What is the answer to this question: What is one of the most influential changes to tort law?","output":"One of the most influential changes to tort law in the 20th century was the introduction of the rule of strict liability for defective products.

Summarize: Medway NHS Foundation Trust has made \\"substantial improvements\\", the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. Medway Maritime was one of 11 hospitals branded \\"inadequate\\" after Sir Bruce Keogh's review of hospitals in 2013. Previous inspections had highlighted concerns over patient safety, organisation and governance. BBC South East health correspondent Mark Norman said the hospital had spent 41 months in special measures, rather than the 12 months originally expected. Live: More on this story and other news from Kent Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt said: \\"Some of the problems at Medway were deeply entrenched - which makes the achievement all the greater.\\" Chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Sir Mike Richards, checked the trust over five days at the end of last year. In his inspection report, he said: \\"There is no doubt that substantial improvements have been made. The leadership team is now fully established and there is a strong sense of forward momentum.\\" As part of addressing its problems, the hospital took up a successful buddying arrangement with Guys' and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and is now \\"good\\" for effectiveness, care and leadership. It still \\"requires improvement\\" for safety and responsiveness. Lesley Dwyer, chief executive of the trust, said: \\"I am so pleased the improvements we are all so proud of have been recognised. This is a great tribute to our dedicated staff and the fantastic job they do day in, day out. \\"We acknowledge there is, of course, more to do. We have every reason to believe that we can build on this momentum and continue to improve.\\" When the hospital's chief executive stood up in front of a packed staff canteen and said the words \\"out of special measures\\" there were cheers, there was  relief and even a few tears of joy. Four and a half thousand people work for the trust; one of their senior staff told me they have endured four years of being told they were no good at their job. Yes, the Care Quality Commission has some ongoing concerns, but when I first interviewed Lesley Dwyer almost two years ago she said she thought her biggest difficulty would be engaging the staff and reigniting a sense of believe in them. She would appear to have done that. The CQC highlighted the \\"commitments and hard work of the staff\\" in achieving this turnaround. There were some elements of \\"outstanding\\" practice at the trust, the inspection noted. The neonatal unit's breast-feeding at discharge rate has soared while a new bereavement suite for families experiencing a still birth, critical care services and the treatment of patients experiencing broken hips were all highly praised. The CQC is to return to check further improvements have been made. Summary:","output":"The Medway NHS Foundation Trust hospital has gotten a lot better, according to some important people called the Care Quality Commission (CQC). A few years ago, the hospital wasn't doing very well and needed help. So, they spent more time working on fixing their problems, and now they are doing a good job at taking care of sick people and making them feel better. The people who work in the hospital are really happy, and the boss of the hospital says they will keep working to make things even better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The night Democrats reclaimed “Obamacare” There’s been a major development in health-care politics over the last few months. The Obama administration and the Republicans came to an agreement on health reform. Not the law itself — they’re still at each other’s throats over that. But they finally agree on how to refer to it. Nowadays, both sides are calling it Obamacare. And during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, the Democrats talked about Obamacare. A lot. That was, in itself, a surprise. Obamacare — or, as it’s officially called, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — doesn’t poll particularly well, and it’s believed to have been a key contributor to the Republican victory in 2010. But Democrats appear to think that the politics have changed. Indeed, if the first night of the Democratic Convention is to be remembered for anything aside from Michelle Obama’s speech, it will probably be remembered as the night that Democrats stood up and began fighting for their health-care law. Michelle Obama and the Democrats doubled down on “Obamacare.” (Jae C. Hong/AP) “Governor Romney says people like me were the most excited about President Obama the day we voted for him,” said Stacey Lihn, whose daughter was born with a congenital heart defect. “But that’s not true. Not even close. For me, there was the day the Affordable Care Act passed and I no longer had to worry about Zoe getting the care she needed. There was the day the letter arrived from the insurance company, saying that our daughter’s lifetime cap had been lifted.” Lihn wasn’t shy about the stakes for her family. “Governor Romney repealing health care reform is something we worry about literally every day,” she said. “Zoe’s third open-heart surgery will happen either next year or the year after. If Mitt Romney becomes president and Obamacare is repealed, there’s a good chance she’ll hit her lifetime cap.” Michelle Obama, in the featured speech of the night, also emphasized the Affordable Care Act. “When it comes to the health of our families, Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day, another president,” she said. “He didn’t care whether it was the easy thing to do politically – that’s not how he was raised – he cared that it was the right thing to do.” The fact that Democrats even have the opportunity to take ownership of a health-care reform law is, in a way, a surprise. In 2006, it seemed entirely possible that Mitt Romney was going to take health care away from the Democrats as an issue. After all, here was the first working, near-universal health-care system in any state in the union, and it was by a Republican governor who was planning a run for president. Handicapping the race in April 2006, David Broder wrote that Romney’s “health plan gives him a unique calling card.” Endorsing Romney in January 2007, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) said, “he has demonstrated, when he stepped into government in a very difficult state, that he could work in a difficult partisan environment, take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured. Those kind of ideas show an ability to bring people together that we haven’t seen in national politics for a while.” Fast forward a year and Romney had already dropped his health-care plan, to the dismay of some Republicans. “Romney has distanced himself from his own innovative Massachusetts health-care reform,” wrote Michael Gerson, “fearful that his hidden virtues of creativity and bipartisanship might be exposed in public.” But if Republicans weren’t rallying around Romney’s plan, at least they were rallying around some plans. The initial version of Rep. Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap” included an ambitious health-care reform proposal that would have wiped out the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance and replaced it with a refundable tax credit for all Americans. A year later, when his Roadmap became the central legislative priority of House Republicans, he dropped the health-reform proposal from the budget. Republicans have almost entirely ceded the field on health care to Democrats. They ran in 2010 on “repeal-and-replace,” but they’ve never figured out a replacement. Romney has a “health care” section on his web site, but it’s so vague that it’s impossible to say what he actually intends to do. So far, that’s served them well. It’s allowed them to attack the Democrats’ Affordable Care Act without opening themselves up to criticism on the specifics of their plan. But it’s also meant that they don’t have specific answers for the health-care crisis. They don’t have anything to tell Stacey Lihn. That’s left an opening for the Democrats — an opening that, for the first time, they seem intent on taking. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Alright kiddo, this is a big topic, but I'll try to break it down in a simple way. Remember when we talked about laws and how they can help to protect people? Well, there was a big law introduced a while ago, called the Affordable Care Act, but some people also know it as Obamacare, after the president who introduced it, President Obama. This law was made to help people get medical help or treatment without having to worry about it costing too much money.  So, recently at a big meeting called the Democratic National Convention, the people who belong to the Democratic party (that's one of our big political groups, like teams), spoke a lot about this law, Obamacare. They said they still really believe in it, and they want to keep fighting so it stays.  In particular, they heard from a woman named Stacey Lihn, whose daughter was born with a heart problem. She explained how important the law was to her family, because it meant they didn't have to worry about whether they could afford her daughter's heart operations. Some people are worried though, because there's another team, called the Republicans, who have a different view. When they were in charge, they tried to change the way healthcare works in America too, through a plan known as Romney's plan, but they have since stopped pushing for it. Now, the Democrats are saying, \\"Hey, if you guys aren't going to help fix things, then we will.\\" That's the big fuss about it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline  with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me. It's a keep-forever book and I'm so happy to have it in my collection to share with the children I love most. Question: The purpose of this passage is to   _  .

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"In order to determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, we need to analyze and understand the context and meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"And perhaps that was an over-calculation.\\" This sentence suggests that there might have been an error in the calculation or that the calculation yielded a result that was larger or more complex than necessary. The term \\"over-calculation\\" implies that there was an excessive estimation or a misjudgment of the situation, leading to an incorrect or inefficient outcome. The use of \\"perhaps\\" indicates that this is a speculation, not a definitive fact. Sentence 2: \\"The calculation was perfect.\\" This sentence states that the calculation was accurate, precise, and without any error or inefficiency. In this case, the outcome is considered flawless and completely correct, meeting or exceeding the expectations or requirements of the situation. Now, let us examine the relationship between these sentences. The first sentence implies that there could be an error in the calculation, while the second sentence claims that the calculation is perfect. These statements contradict each other, as a perfect calculation would not yield an over-calculation. Since these sentences are incompatible, it is impossible for both to be true simultaneously. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, which indicates the possibility of an over-calculation, then the second sentence cannot be true, as it claims that the calculation is perfect. Conversely, if the second sentence is true, then the first sentence cannot be true as it questions the calculation's perfection.

The mother's experience not only highlights the pressing issue of societal discrimination against breastfeeding but also calls for increased awareness and support for mothers choosing to breastfeed in public spaces. Background and Context: The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for infants up to two years of age, as it provides various health and developmental benefits to both the child and mother. Despite this, breastfeeding in public – often a practical necessity for new mothers – remains a controversial topic in many parts of the world.  The Incident: The mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, shared her story in the hopes of raising awareness about the challenges breastfeeding mothers face in public spaces. According to her account, she was at a restaurant in Belfast when her baby began to cry for milk. As she discreetly began breastfeeding the child, another customer in the restaurant approached her and made derogatory and offensive comments. The individual criticised her actions as being inappropriate, and even questioned her character and parental abilities. Mother's Reaction: Taken aback by such comments, the mother felt humiliated and vulnerable in front of other patrons. She also expressed disappointment and frustration that she had to justify her choice of feeding her child in public.

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday met for 80 minutes in the Oval Office with a general he described as the second most powerful man in North Korea. Afterward, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that the June 12 summit in Singapore between him and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was back on. Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. As the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike. Less clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way. \\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity. Upon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un. While Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \\"very nice.\\" According to the above context, answer the following question.

Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  But I can use this background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  What is an answer for this question: In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","output":"Rob would not observe the quarrying effect this year when he visited the Ural Mountains in Russia. This is because he didn't see any valley glaciers there, and the quarrying effect, or plucking, is a phenomenon that occurs in valley glaciers. Last year, when he visited the Alps in Austria and saw a valley glacier, he would have had a better chance to observe the quarrying effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: tifu by having my penis touched for the first time.  i've made some edits to the story so hopefully it is easier to read. sorry that it was poorly written before.  --- when i was younger, i went on a lot of mission trips with my church. this takes place the summer after my 15th birthday. we all piled into the astrovan, 8 of us. my best friend growing up (let's call him sam), the main female in the story (let's call her hanna), and i took the back seats. she made herself comfortable between us in the middle of the backrow. soon, we were all piled in, the engine sputtered to life, and we were off. the trip this year was in ohio. it was roughly a three hour trip from home.  maybe fifteen minutes into the trip, hanna brought out this massager. you may remember the type: green, four pronged, vibrating? we took turns giving each other innocent massages, but slowly, it's vibrations shook a palpable sexual tension over the back three seats of the van. it definitely was not uncommon to feel that way back then, but this was the first time i knew a female was feeling it about me, too.  her massage found its way to my legs. a glancing buzz to my thigh. oddly enough, it was not just me getting the deluxe treatment. sam as well was being given the same genital teasing flyover. she was buzzing our towers, closer than tom cruise in top gun.   then, as things reached a critical crossroads, sam passes me a note by way of his phone's notepad. \\"let her massage your dick,\\" it said. i was shy, very shy, but there was nothing hesitant about the urgent fashion i pecked out the letters n-o on that t9 keyboard. my urgency and reluctance, however, had met its match in sam's ability to manipulate simple text. as quickly as i had typed no, he changed it to yes and \\"accidentally\\" let hanna see.  now, one thing we can all agree on, is a young, inexperienced male in the heat of puberty can be seduced by nothing more than a breeze. i was no different. moments later, her hand had slid up my gym shorts and her hands began to explore my crotch. i positioned a blanket over my lap and more or less gave her free reign of my undercarriage. now, despite my lifelong anticipation for what was now happening, it was accompanied by a sudden, saddening realization that she had not developed the same deft stroke that i had grown accustomed. i was the opposite of \\"enjoying it\\", but had enough worldly awareness to realize what was happening was too rare for me to reject. the setting wasn't great, her technique was worse, but i hope that you all will understand why i felt obligated to try my best to appreciate my circumstances.  fast-forward an hour. imagine all the ways cosmopolitan had steered this poor girl wrong, and sympathize with me. i was paying the price of years of poorly researched techniques in somehow trustable printed ink. the fact that this treasonous act was still being performed on my royal jewels that long after should be evidence enough of her lack of prowess. there was a lot of squeezing and tugging, not things i would ordinarily associate with enjoyment in those regions.  after a little more than an hour total, the astrovan stopped for lunch. as did the other vehicles. it was a great but only temporary reprieve. sam had a pb&j sandwich and a laugh at my suffering. i don't remember having much of an appetite.  now let me remind you at this junction that we were on a mission trip, through our church, with my church's youth group. the mission trip was to last 5 days. we'd brought sleeping bags, pillows, and blankets so we'd be comfortable sleeping on the floor of a community center gymnasium. okay. got it? now let's continue.  my reprieve, as i stated before, was only temporary. when we were back on the road, sam and i flipped our places in the back of the van, presumably to give her other arm a rest. almost immediately, it began again. i pulled my hat over my eyes, faking sleep, but the rise and fall of my blanket in my lap proved my restlessness. some thirty minutes later, something happened. something that gave me reasonable cause to write in to cosmo's complaint department and file a full-fledged grievance. the basketball shorts i was wearing hardly provided barrier to my more \\"protected\\" assets. her hand, being slid up my shorts, was right there...some guys like fingers in their rectum, i get that, but that section of the article should've been prefaced with adequate prerequisite stipulations. 1) never in a van, 2) never while with your church group 3) never suddenly, aggressively, or 4) while wearing sharp gel nails. fuck, man.  this entire time, sam is very aware of my displeasure. i think he may of giggled, just then.  fast forward five more minutes. sam, somehow still thoroughly entertained, in a merciful act of triage, gives her some much needed pointers. \\"pointers\\" of a completely different variety, if you catch my drift. i think he gestured to her the proper technique because suddenly things got a lot more focused in a great way.  suddenly, it become pleasurable. the pleasure grows. finally, in much the fashion you'd expect of someone in my situation, i was not far from relief. this is where i unintentionally manufactured my revenge on this penal penile perpetrator. i lifted the blanket off my crotch as i orgasmed, exposing my cock and creating an uncertainty as where the explosion would go. her reaction, perhaps also from lack of real-life experience, was to raise a shield to protect herself from what i can only guess she assumed would be enormous, and deadly. and actually, to my surprise as much as hers, it was. it absolutely devastated her shield. which was her pillow. the one that she would be sleeping on for the next five nights... she made a sound then. not a grunt, or a scream. not a sound that has a name. for the sake of building it with your imagination, let's call it the \\"someone jizzed everywhere\\" sound. fleeting innocence, utter shock, sadness, fury, all boiled down into one cacophonous squeal.  we haven't spoken since.  -------","output":"In a humorous situation during a church mission trip, a teenage boy finds himself receiving an unexpected and initially unpleasant experience from a female friend in the back of a van.

Article: You have several options when choosing a modelling clay to sculpt your face. Each clay is different, so choose the clay that best suits your purposes.  Ceramic clays are water-based and easy to work with right out of the bag. It needs to stay moist while being worked, as it can dry out and crack. Ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture.  Plasteline clay is an oil-based clay that doesn't dry out, and can't be fire hardened. It is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail.  Polymer clays require an armature, or a wire skeleton, for support. They are weaker than other clays, but are good for painting. Polymer clays can be fire hardened, though they are not as hard as ceramic clays. Aside from the clay, you'll need a few other things before you can start sculpting. A good, clean working area is necessary, as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture. You can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores.  You don't have to buy specialized tools for sculpting. It may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose. The main functions of your tools are to cut, scrape, and shape the clay. You can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay, and add detail. If you know the person whose face you are sculpting, take pictures of them from all angles. Try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera. Take some from the side as well to get a good profile.  If you're basing your sculpture on a famous person, find photos on the internet and print them out. Make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person's proportions.  It may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features. Think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture. Think about who they are, what they do, and why you want to sculpt them. Use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture. Do a rough drawing of different expressions to get some ideas for how you want your sculpture to look. The drawing doesn't have to be perfect. It's just a tool to help you plot out your sculpture. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides an overview of different types of modelling clay for sculpting faces, including ceramic, plasteline, and polymer clays, discussing their properties and usage.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

Write a title for this article: How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation How a book became salvation (CNN) -- Inside a trailer in Honaker, Virginia, is a 5-year-old girl who loves lemon-lime slush. She sleeps in a room with a quilted bedspread and matching purple curtains. She adores her cat Tiger, dogs Smoky and Rusty and a black, pop-eyed goldfish. Her family is poor, and she is eating potted meat, blowing away cracker crumbs that fall into her lap. \\"Daddy,\\" she whispers when her father, a welder, comes home. He does not respond. His eyes are wild. He collapses into a rocking chair, his hands trembling, his breathing labored. She doesn't understand her father's strange behavior. It's as though he's in the grip of the devil. She hides behind the couch, her knees press against the shag carpeting. Later, she will remember this moment as the first time she was afraid of her father. A hole in her soul Christal Presley, 34, held her breath for two seemingly endless days in mid-October. In Honaker, more than 300 miles away from her home in Atlanta, her father had just received a package in the mail. It contained an early copy of Christal's new book. On the cover: a sepia-tone snapshot of Delmer Presley holding his rifle in Vietnam. Christal had staked her whole life on words crafted from love and pain. But what would they mean to her father? Delmer Presley, Christal Presley's father, was drafted before his 19th birthday and served a year in Vietnam. Would they offer comfort like the conversations that resulted in the book? Or would they act as another trigger point for a man who never left war behind? \\"Thirty Days With My Father\\" is a gritty memoir written by a woman haunted by what some psychologists describe as second-generation post-traumatic stress disorder. The trauma began in Vietnam, affected Delmer and then Christal, says psychiatrist Frank Ochberg, a trauma expert who served on the committee that defined PTSD in the post-Vietnam era. Christal, he says, suffered profound injury. And it stayed with her. Outwardly, her life appeared successful: She settled in Atlanta, owned a house, worked as an educator. But she always felt a hole in her soul. She didn't know her father -- or herself. How was it, she wondered, that a war that ended before her birth had marred her life in so many ways? The book became Christal's salvation -- \\"my last resort to find happiness,\\" she says. But she worried about how her father would feel seeing his troubled life exposed to the entire world. Encourage him to read the ending first, she told her mom. That way, he will understand: It's not just an ugly portrait of pain. It's a book about healing. Christal grew up affected by the post-traumatic stress disorder that her father suffered after fighting in Vietnam. Christal was only 5, but she remembers clearly that day when her family came undone. Her father, on his way home from work, had come upon an accident on the highway. His friend, Josh Coleman, was dead. It was the first time Delmer had seen a body since he returned from his yearlong tour of duty. Thirteen years had passed, but instantly, his mind reeled back to Vietnam: to underground tunnels brimming with snakes and booby traps laced with sharp punji sticks that skewered his buddies like meat. Christal never knew normal again. Gone was the man who gave her piggyback rides, ate mud pies and smiled as he watched her play an angel in a school play. Delmer vacillated between depression, silence and sheer rage. He locked himself in the bedroom his wife had decorated with shadow boxes filled with Delmer's medals, Army boots, hats, dog tags and a worn pocket-size military-issue Bible. The room screamed war, Christal says. She was scared to enter. At Christmas, Delmer never watched Christal open presents. She could hear him playing music in his room. She learned to resent the guitar her father loved so much. She wished he would spend time with her, speak to her, seek solace in her. When a truck backfired or Christal dropped a plate by accident, her father leaped up and went into soldier-at-war mode. Christal hated going out to eat at noisy restaurants -- everyone just stared. The worst moments came when he picked up his shotgun and left the house for Little River, announcing to Christal and her mother, Judy, that he was going to kill himself. As time passed, Christal forgot the daddy she'd once known. Judy, a Pentecostal Christian, believed you had to be perfect to reach heaven and kept the family's struggles secret. Christal pretended to the outside world that their life was normal. Once when she was 6, she stole a neighbor's photo of a family trip to the beach. She cut the family's smiling faces out and replaced them with pictures of herself and her mom and dad. She showed the doctored photo off in class, describing for her classmates what a great time they'd had. Ironically, it was Delmer's trauma that enabled Christal to escape her parents' home. Until then, every birthday had not been a celebration as much as it was a countdown to the day she'd turn 18 and be able to leave. The federal government paid for her schooling at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. That's because by then, the Army had declared her father 100% disabled. When Delmer returned from Vietnam in 1970, psychiatrists were just starting to recognize PTSD as an impairment. The first diagnosis for Vietnam veterans did not occur until 1980 when Christal was 2. Veterans weren't encouraged to seek help, like they are these days. \\"My dad just thought he was going crazy.\\" As frightening as it was for Christal to leave Honaker and be alone for the first time, she felt liberated. \\"I was so tired of living in a war zone,\\" she says. \\"I really thought my father ruined my life.\\" As a girl, she had taken a razor from her mother's sewing kit and sliced her skin open. She cut herself with an ink pen and stapled her hands. Hurting herself was a way to be close to her dad. He was in such pain, she thought, that she would be, too. In college, she mixed anti-depressants with rum and tequila and drank alone. She wanted to numb herself like PTSD sufferers do. She had her father's eyes -- and his behavior. Severe mood swings. Anxiety. She was hypersensitive to sounds. She stood back and skimmed the crowd in a room, looking for the quickest exit. She was private, reserved. She didn't trust people. She told Delmer she hated him. She went through boyfriend after boyfriend, craving a man's touch, looking for the affection her father had never shown. She dreaded driving back home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. As she approached winding John Douglas Wayside in Abingdon and began her climb up the Virginia mountains, she had flashbacks. She saw herself as a child wrapped tightly around Delmer's legs, trying to prevent him from going down to the river to kill himself. Or lying on her bed, curled into a fetal ball. In college, she saw a therapist regularly and didn't speak to her father, except peripherally, for 13 years. In that time, she came to understand that her troubles were related to his. \\"My father got that way from being in Vietnam,\\" Christal says. \\"I got it from being around him.\\" A baby Christal sits on Delmer's lap. He found solace in his music and would sometimes play the guitar eight hours a day. After college and teaching jobs and a brief marriage, Christal settled in Atlanta. But she ventured in several directions in search of an inner peace: to holy sites in the Indian Himalayas, to the halls of academia, where she earned a doctorate in education. Always, she came up empty. She'd begun writing as a way to understand herself and work through her problems. One day, her coach in a writing group challenged her to take on the subject she feared most. Her father. She decided to ask Delmer if he would participate in a series of conversations about Vietnam. Just in case things became unbearable, she set a time limit for her project: 30 days. She could stand anything as long as an end was in sight. She was sure Delmer would refuse. Why would he speak about it now when he had kept it to himself for almost four decades? When Delmer said yes, Christal was taken aback. She had been so certain he would not participate that she didn't even know how to begin. The first few conversations were strained. Delmer sounded suspicious. But by Day Four, he was telling her how he got a draft letter just before his 19th birthday. \\"It was after the Tet Offensive, the worst time to be drafted,\\" Delmer said. The surprise North Vietnamese military campaign is considered the turning point of the war. \\"America saw right then that this wasn't going to be a fast war,\\" he said. \\"The American people went berserk, turned against their own. They stopped supporting the war, hated us soldiers like devils.\\" Christal was humbled by her father's words. And appalled to learn of the public scorn. Such a thing would never happen today, she thought. The conversations continued day by day, through the end of 2009. Delmer talked about Agent Orange, the defoliant that rained down on the jungle from U.S. planes. He blames it for a tumor he developed in his right lung and cysts on his fingers. He told her he placed men he knew in body bags for their final journey home. She asked whether he was in My Lai when U.S. soldiers were ordered to wipe out the village -- unarmed civilians, including women and children. Delmer told her he was not but that he was ordered to pull guard the day Pentagon authorities went in to investigate. Christal had read about My Lai. She told her father that 500 bodies were found. \\"You are wrong about that,\\" Delmer said. \\"There were 504.\\" Christal had not known her father's anguish until then -- the moments he relived, the guilt he felt for surviving. With two months left in Vietnam, Delmer welcomed another young soldier to his platoon. The commanders made Delmer trade places with the newbie, who was placed at the front of the line in their battlefield maneuvers. Christal's mother, Judy, was embarrassed by the family's struggles and urged her daughter to keep them secret. The soldier stepped on a booby trap. Delmer never came to terms with the soldier's death. He knew the young man had a newborn daughter he had never seen. Delmer lay awake at night thinking: \\"It should have been me.\\" When her father shared that story, Christal was silent on the phone. She'd thought of her dad as a guy pointing a gun -- not as someone who suffered. Days after sending a copy of her book to her father, Christal met a woman who wanted to write about her project for a blog called Family Of A Vet. They talked over lunch at Tin Lizzy's restaurant near downtown Atlanta. The woman's husband did three tours of Iraq and is disabled by PTSD and traumatic brain injury. She takes care of him and her three young children. Daughter Caitlin, 9, had come along. Christal was talking about her 30-day project when Caitlin piped up. \\"Christal,\\" she said. \\"My mommy says your daddy was in a war, too.\\" \\"Yes, a long time ago, my daddy was in a war called Vietnam,\\" Christal told her. \\"Miss Christal,\\" said Caitlin. \\"Were you scared of your daddy like I am scared of mine? My daddy yells a lot, and I go into my room and hide.\\" \\"Caitlin,\\" said Christal. \\"Sometimes when someone comes back from war, they can't help themselves. Like a baby who cries.\\" Christal had always thought her father was distant and detached because he didn't love her. She always thought it was her fault. \\"Yeah, because they've seen bad things,\\" Caitlin said. Christal had spoken with other grown children of Vietnam veterans. But this was the first time she saw herself in a child. Christal contained herself in front of Caitlin. But when she and her mom drove away after lunch, Christal burst into tears. It was a week before her book launch. Christal had a calendar chock-full of media interviews. She was confident that veteran communities would welcome her book. She was less sure about her father. It took him two days to finish reading. The phone rang, finally, on a Tuesday afternoon. \\"It's a good book, Christal,\\" Delmer told her. \\"Do you like it?\\" she asked. No other review was going to matter. Along a living room wall in Christal's home in Atlanta stands a case containing a new Alvarez guitar. Delmer bought it for her three years ago, the first time they spent Christmas together after the 30-day project. She'd told him she wanted to learn how to play. She knows that without his music, her father might be dead. It kept him going after he couldn't work anymore. It was like an extra limb. Sometimes he played for eight hours a day. He loves Ricky Skaggs, Ralph Stanley. War songs. Even wrote one himself. \\"Having the guitar here makes me feel like a part of my father is here,\\" she says. He sketched out chords for her on pieces of white paper, but Christal has been so busy finishing her book, she hasn't had time to learn. Soon, she says, she will. The guitar is not the only talisman in her home tying Christal to her father. Inside a small silver urn is a piece of a sandbag. The color is still a vivid sky blue. Next to it is a piece of asphalt. She found them in Vietnam. After the series of talks with her father, Christal felt compelled to go to Vietnam, to Chu Lai, down Route 1, to the place the Americans called LZ (landing zone) Bayonet, to the fire base known as Fat City. Soldier's Heart, an organization that supports veterans and their families suffering from psychological wounds, made the trip possible. She climbed the slope of the landing pad where her father had slept. She gazed at a trench overgrown with grass and yellow wildflowers. The mountains behind her must have been where a young Delmer schlepped through thick jungle with a gun in his hand and a radio strapped to his back. She could still see tank tracks embedded in the asphalt. And boot prints. Christal stepped inside, Vietnam surging through her body. She felt ashamed she had treated her father the way she had. If only she could go back in time. Delmer felt the same way. He told her he locked himself away because he didn't want to hurt her. \\"I let her down,\\" he says. \\"It's my fault. I didn't realize I was hurting anyone.\\" One time, he was frantic on the phone with Christal. He hadn't burned any villages or killed any people, he told her as though someone were accusing him. She no longer thought him crazy. She told him he's the bravest person she knows. She is sorry she couldn't see that earlier. \\"I forgive you. I forgive myself,\\" Christal told him. Delmer says he's happy, at least, that before he hangs up the phone with Christal these days, he can say: \\"I love you.\\" There is a temple in Vietnam, lush with ponds and trees with branches hanging low. Outside, merchants sell birds, turtles and fish. Christal learns that people buy them and set them free in the temple, in accordance with the Eastern belief of the eternal nature of the soul. She thinks back on a childhood fishing trip with her father. The fish she caught swallowed the hook and worm whole. It bled through the gills and gasped for life. \\"She's dying,\\" Christal howled, begging Delmer to save it. Delmer was calm, confident. He cut the line, freed the fish and assured her it would live. It struggled for a few seconds and then dived deep into the water. Christal thinks now her father is like that fish -- a survivor. It is the day before she is to leave Vietnam and journey home. She steps forward, peers at the bags of goldfish for sale. One is black, like the fish she had in her aquarium as a little girl. That's the one she chooses. She walks over to the pond, opens the bag and watches the fish swim away.","output":"The Story of How a Book Helped a Girl and Her Dad Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived with her family in Virginia. Her dad had been in a big war called Vietnam before she was born, and it made him behave strangely sometimes because it hurt his feelings very much. The girl grew up and moved away from home, but still felt scared and sad about her dad. One day, as a grown-up, the girl decided to write a book to understand her dad better. She talked to her dad for 30 days about the war and the things that happened to him. The more they talked, the more the girl learned about why her dad behaved the way he did. The book they made together helped them both heal from their pain and fear. In the end, the girl realized her dad was very brave, and they were able to share their love for each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor \\"Little Nikki\\" and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every \\"Air Band\\" at the time impersonating Prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out.

Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.

Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

Background: Elizabeth was born on 3 February 1821 in a house on Dicksons Street in Bristol, England, to Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner, and his wife Hannah (Lane) Blackwell. She had two older siblings, Anna and Marian, and would eventually have six younger siblings: Samuel (married Antoinette Brown), Henry (married Lucy Stone), Emily (third woman in the U.S. to get a medical degree), Sarah Ellen (a writer), John and George. Four maiden aunts, Barbara, Ann, Lucy and Mary, also lived with Blackwell during Blackwell's childhood. Context: Once again, through her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a job, this time teaching music at an academy in Asheville, North Carolina, with the goal of saving up the 3,000 necessary for her medical school expenses. In Asheville, Blackwell lodged with the respected Reverend John Dickson, who happened to have been a physician before he became a clergyman. Dickson approved of Blackwell's career aspirations and allowed her to use the medical books in his library to study. During this time, Blackwell soothed her own doubts about her choice and her loneliness with deep religious contemplation. She also renewed her antislavery interests, starting a slave Sunday school that was ultimately unsuccessful.  Dickson's school closed down soon after, and Blackwell moved to the residence of Reverend Dickson's brother, Samuel Henry Dickson, a prominent Charleston, physician. She started teaching in 1846 at a boarding school in Charleston run by a Mrs. Du Pre. With the help of Reverend Dickson's brother, Blackwell inquired into the possibility of medical study via letters, with no favorable responses. In 1847, Blackwell left Charleston for Philadelphia and New York, with the aim of personally investigating the opportunities for medical study. Blackwell's greatest wish was to be accepted into one of the Philadelphia medical schools.  My mind is fully made up. I have not the slightest hesitation on the subject; the thorough study of medicine, I am quite resolved to go through with. The horrors and disgusts I have no doubt of vanquishing. I have overcome stronger distastes than any that now remain, and feel fully equal to the contest. As to the opinion of people, I don't care one straw personally; though I take so much pains, as a matter of policy, to propitiate it, and shall always strive to do so; for I see continually how the highest good is eclipsed by the violent or disagreeable forms which contain it.  Upon reaching Philadelphia, Blackwell boarded with Dr. William Elder and studied anatomy privately with Dr. Jonathan M. Allen as she attempted to get her foot in the door at any medical school in Philadelphia. She was met with resistance almost everywhere. Most physicians recommended that she either go to Paris to study or that she take up a disguise as a man to study medicine. The main reasons offered for her rejection were that (1) she was a woman and therefore intellectually inferior, and (2) she might actually prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to \\"furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with\\".

Text: long story short, i came across an amazing job listing a few weeks ago. i met all the qualifications and then some. the listed salary is fantastic and the benefits are even better so i e-mailed them a resume and some of my work. so i get an e-mail two weeks after submitting my resume stating \\"are you okay for a phone interview at 3:00 today?\\", which i of course replied \\"yes\\" to. this being such a great opportunity for me, i go through about an hour of preparation. i set my desk up nice and tidy even though the interviewer could not see me, got a glass of water and did some stretches. i get the call and about 2/3 of the way into the phone interview i get a bit too happy about how great the job and interview seems to be going and get a bit too comfortable. the interviewer (in this case, the coo of the company) states that the office attire is casual and that he's currently wearing shorts. i respond by saying \\"that's fucking great\\". immediately my brain goes from organized and professional into spaghetti spiller mode and i say \\"oops\\" instead of \\"excuse me\\". there was a second of silence that felt like hours. a few seconds after, while he's still asking me questions my dog hears someone ring the doorbell and starts barking out of control. i run over to him and force him to go outside by grabbing him all the while he's still barking. the interview finished with him asking me if i had any more work i could show him. even though it has been a handful of hours since the interview, i'm still going crazy about it and can't stop beating myself up over the incident. i really, really hope they at least give a chance at an in-person interview.

Movie title: Ultraviolet Movie plot: Ultraviolet takes place in 2078, in the years following a global epidemic that causes vampire-like symptoms, including super-human physical abilities, a healing factor and elongated canines. The infected \\"hemophages\\" die within twelve years after being infected. The \\"Archministry\\", a militant medical group headed by Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus, has taken control of the government and begun rounding up infected citizens and exterminating them in order to contain the virus. Having been infected a decade earlier, Violet Song Jat Shariff has become a member of an underground resistance movement fighting to protect the hemophages from the government. Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was apparently created to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named \\"Six\\". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with the boy, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them. She eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone. He also tells her that the boy has a tracking device embedded in him (\\"so hot he's nearly radioactive\\"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Nerva reveals to Violet that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When he refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives and takes Six's body for dissection. Later, however, Violet realizes that Six may not actually be dead. She storms the Archministry and reaches a lab just as Daxus is about to begin the dissection. In the...

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: As the film opens, US Special Forces sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his scout Donny Fenn (Lane Garrison) lie in wait in the hills of Ethiopia, ready to deliver covering fire for a US convoy heading back to base through hostile country. They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames. The smoke engulfs the screen as the helicopter crashes and explodes.Three years later Swagger is a private citizen, living in the mountains, a recluse from the world that abandoned him. Unshaven and long haired, he lives alone; his only companion his dog, trained to open the fridge and take out a cold beer for Swagger as he returns to his cabin. Sharing a slurp of the beer with his dog, Swagger turns on his PC and the Internet, looking at news of a world that mostly has him shaking his head.

What is the plus 4 zip code for 39213? How do you find out what your zip code plus four is? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The first question is asking for the \\"+4\\" extension of the zip code 39213, while the second question is a general inquiry on how to find out the \\"+4\\" extension for any zip code. Although closely related, these questions are not inquiring about the same information, but rather the first is seeking specific information while the second is looking for a general method to obtain similar information. To address the first question: The zip code 39213 is located in Jackson, Mississippi. However, it is important to note that a ZIP+4 code is a more specific code that represents a particular location or address. Usually, this 9-digit code has a format like 'XXXXX-XXXX', where the first 5 digits are the traditional zip code, and the additional 4 numbers represent a specific location or delivery route within that region. Because a Zip+4 code refers to a unique location, I would require more information such as a specific street address or a PO box number in order to accurately provide the +4 extension code for 39213. As for the second question, here's a step-by-step explanation on how to find out your ZIP+4 code: 1. Begin by identifying the complete address for which you want to find the +4 extension. This should include the street address, city, state, and of course, the 5-digit zip code. 2. Visit the United States Postal Service (USPS) official website at www.usps.com. 3. Under \\"Quick Tools\\" on the USPS homepage, click on the \\"ZIP Code Lookup\\" option. 4. Once on the \\"ZIP Code Lookup\\" page, input the required address information (street, city, state), and click \\"Find\\". 5. The USPS will provide the complete 9-digit ZIP+4 code for the address you entered. It's important to note that the USPS ZIP Code Lookup tool is typically the most accurate and up-to-date source to find your ZIP+4 code since they are responsible for creating and maintaining these codes for mailing purposes. Other third-party websites may also provide this information but may not be as accurate or current as the USPS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Negative Tone: The review has a predominantly negative tone, using strong language such as \\"exercise in bad\\" and \\"total waste of money.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the product and warns potential buyers against purchasing it. 2. Criticism of Music Quality: The reviewer specifically criticizes the music as \\"bad\\" and questions the decision to unearth the rare recordings. This criticism directly addresses the core purpose of the product - to provide enjoyable music. If the music is not enjoyable, the product is not fulfilling its primary function, which would deter potential buyers. 3. Criticism of Reproduction Quality: In addition to criticizing the music itself, the reviewer also takes issue with the reproduction quality. This suggests that the product has technical flaws, which further detracts from its value and appeal to potential buyers. 4. Disappointment with Featured Artists: The reviewer specifically mentions disappointment in the performance of Brownie McGhee, one of the featured artists. This indicates that even fans of this artist may be disappointed with the product, making it even less attractive to potential buyers. 5. Ineffective Praise: The reviewer does offer praise for the cover art, but immediately follows this with a statement that the music is the equivalent of a cold shower. This juxtaposition effectively negates any positive impact the cover art may have had, as it shows that the only positive aspect of the product is superficial and unrelated to its primary function - the music. In conclusion, this review would likely have a strong negative impact on the potential purchase decision. With criticisms targeting both the music itself and the technical aspects of the product, as well as disappointment with the featured artists, it is unlikely that a potential buyer would be encouraged to make a purchase based on this review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter and dumping her body in Texas' Galveston Bay went on trial Tuesday on capital murder charges in the child's death, court officials said. Kimberly Dawn Trenor has pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge, her attorney says. Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, pleaded guilty last week to tampering with evidence in the case, but she pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge, said her attorney, Tom Stickler. Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, also faces capital murder and evidence-tampering charges, but is being tried separately and has not been arraigned. The body of Trenor's daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers, was found in October 2007 in a large plastic blue container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay. Jurors in Trenor's trial also will determine her sentence on the evidence-tampering charge, which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison, according to The Houston Chronicle. Riley Ann's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body. Authorities were unsure of her identity, and police dubbed her \\"Baby Grace.\\" After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24, 2007. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay. The disposal of the girl's body led to the evidence-tampering charge. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places, injuries that would have been fatal. A capital murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison, the Chronicle reported. A cross has since been erected on the island where the toddler was found, which was named Riley's Island in her honor, according to the Houston newspaper. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May 2007 to be with Zeigler, whom Trenor had met on the Internet. While in custody, Trenor gave birth this summer to another child, who is now in the care of relatives, her attorney, Tom Stickler, said.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of plants in the class Isoetopsida and order Isoetales. They are lycopods and the only genus in Isoetaceae. There are currently 192 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\", although molecular data place these species among other species of \\"Isoetes\\", so \\"Stylites\\" does not warrant taxonomic recognition.  - Selaginella is the sole genus of vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae, the spikemosses or lesser clubmosses. This family is placed in the class Isoetopsida, distinguished from the sister group Lycopodiopsida (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the \\"fern allies\\". \\"S. moellendorffii\\" is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.  - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds.  - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope.  - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.  - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\")  is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae.  - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras  21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist.  - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production.

DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.  - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species.  - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.  - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.  - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\".  - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) . However , the latter are now usually placed into a separate class , Isoetopsida . Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants , with small , scale - like leaves , homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves , branching stems ( usually dichotomous ) , and generally simple form . The class Lycopodiopsida as interpreted here contains a single living order , the Lycopodiales , and a single extinct order , the Drepanophycales .

Later, he responded to one his followers by saying the guns were for \\"home protection.\\" Turns out, Kaman was in on the joke too. On Saturday, he took to Twitter again saying \\"Ok, all kidding aside, no rapture is happening ...\\" Perhaps he was just looking for a reason to add to his apparently impressive weapon and explosive device collection.

(iv) gets the same grades as others in exams. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Reading is the key to school success and, like any skill, it takes practice. A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity  \\".  www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase  . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount   of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable   for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Question: Rossman tells that any child who_will possibly be an automatic reader.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: One of the best ways to find a good fit for a new position is to consider the loyal staff that already surrounds you. Who as already put in the time required to learn company policies and earn people's trust? You'll save a lot of time if you don't have to risk hiring an outsider to fill a position. Think hard about whether someone you're working with would be right for the role, then encourage them to apply. Create a list with the help of other department leaders or administrators of the most important qualities to look for when you recruit successful staff. Discuss elements like attention to detail, experience, education level and flexibility. Your fellow managers can provide input about the qualities that will make an employee most successful and recommend someone else in the company who might be right for the job. Letting employees at your company know that you're hiring is an excellent way to recruit new candidates. You'll get referrals from people who know the company in and out, and can recommend people who will be a close fit for the job. Employees wouldn't stake their reputation on unqualified candidates, so you're sure to get some keepers if you go this route.  Employees in related positions will have connections to good candidates within the industry and be able to refer friends or colleagues that will meet the job's requirements that are looking for a new job. Send staff an email that includes the job description and ask them to pass it along to people they know who are qualified. Offering incentives for employee referrals can encourage people to take your hunt for the perfect candidate seriously. Sometimes a new opening is best filled by someone from outside the company who can start with a completely fresh slate. You can still use your contacts to recruit, rather than asking for applications from complete strangers. Call up people you've worked with over the years who know you and understand what you look for in an employee. Ask them whether they have suggestions as to who might be a good candidate for the position.  You can reach out to colleagues and business contacts for referrals or positive and negative reviews when you're recruiting employees. Colleagues in the industry can also advise you about a particular website or trade show that's good for finding successful employees. Scouting out great employees is one thing, but you'll need to attract the best and brightest by offering a lot in return. Here's how to light up their eyes:  Play up your company culture. Tell them about what a typical day is like at your company, and give details on the company's \\"personality.\\" Talk about how much you enjoy working there. Offer a competitive salary and benefits. While this isn't always enough to guarantee you'll make the hire, it certainly doesn't hurt. Make the position sound prestigious and challenging. These two factors are big incentives for bright potential candidates. Job satisfaction comes from feeling respected and having the opportunity to learn new things and excel in the face of obstacles. Offer things other companies don't. Flex time, for example, is a highly valued benefit that many companies don't offer. Allowing people to work from home and take time off when they need it can set your company apart from the rest. Hold interview sessions periodically and retain the information of candidates that meet the requirements to be a successful employee, even if you don't have room for one right away. This will give you a pool of solid candidates to review when you have an open position. Make your pool wider and deeper by asking the candidates themselves for referrals. When you call someone on a candidate's list of references, ask about the candidate, then delve into questions on the background of the person you're talking to. You might be able to recruit the candidate's old manager. Recruit successful employees by utilizing online recruiting resources like LinkedIn, or sites specific to your industry that have profiles of people in the field. Many job seekers use these sites to find jobs that meet their skill sets. Even if someone you're interested in already has a job, there's no harm in setting up a meeting to get to know the person. You can discuss the job opening and see if they're interested. If they aren't, they might have suggestions as to who else would make a good candidate. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To find good people for a new job position, it's important to look at your current loyal team members first. You can ask them and other managers about who might be a good fit for the role. Let your employees know about the job opening and ask them to recommend others for the job. Sometimes, talking to people outside the company can also help find good candidates. It's also important to attract great employees by telling them about how nice your company is to work for and giving them competitive pay and benefits. Keep a list of good potential workers for future job openings and use websites like LinkedIn to find more people. Remember to make the job sound prestigious and offer benefits like flex time to make your company special."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The fortune teller read his fate in the crystal ball.","output":"While at first glance, it might seem that the word \\"read\\" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, there is a subtle distinction in the way it is used in the context of each sentence.  In the first sentence, \\"She read the sky and predicted rain,\\" the word \\"read\\" implies an interpretation of observable and discernible signs, such as the colors and patterns in the sky, cloud formations, direction of the wind, or any other natural indicators that point towards an upcoming change in weather. In this sense, the act of reading is focused on analyzing and making sense of the visual cues provided by nature that could signify a forthcoming rainstorm. This type of reading involves a level of experience and expertise gained by understanding the relationship between certain environmental cues and specific weather conditions. In the second sentence, \\"The fortune teller read his fate in the crystal ball,\\" the word \\"read\\" takes on a more mystical, supernatural, or esoteric meaning. Here, the fortune teller is trying to divine or reveal someone's future by peering into the depths of the crystal ball and deciphering the images or symbols they see. This form of \\"reading\\" is more rooted in the realm of spirituality and less in the empirical and observable knowledge that could be gained from interpreting real-world phenomena, as in the first sentence's context. So, while the basic action of \\"reading\\" something might seem the same in both sentences, which is the act of interpreting and extracting information from a source, the context in which they are used, the nature of the objects being read, and the methodologies applied in each case differ significantly.  The first sentence relies on an understanding of the natural world and its processes, whereas the second sentence delves into the symbolic and metaphysical, attributed to supernatural or extrasensory perception.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\"?

Please answer this question: Deborah Kerr played the female lead in the film version of which musical ?","output":"Deborah Kerr played the female lead in the film version of the musical \\"The King and I.\\" This classic movie is an adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that premiered on Broadway in 1951. The film adaptation was released in 1956, directed by Walter Lang, and produced by 20th Century Fox. \\"The King and I\\" is set in the early 1860s and tells the story of Anna Leonowens, a British schoolteacher, who travels to Siam (now called Thailand) to serve as a governess for the many children of King Mongkut. The screenplay is based on Margaret Landon's 1944 novel \\"Anna and the King of Siam,\\" which in turn was inspired by the memoirs of the real-life Anna Leonowens. In the film, Deborah Kerr portrays Anna Leonowens with elegance, grace, and a strong-willed spirit. She is hired to educate the king's children in Western knowledge and values to help modernize Siam and allow it to compete with the international community. Anna's relationship with the King and his children is filled with cultural clashes, intellectual exchanges, and a deep mutual respect, which eventually leads to an unlikely friendship between Anna and the King. Despite Deborah Kerr's iconic performance in the movie, her singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon. However, Kerr's acting skills and chemistry with her co-star, Yul Brynner (who played King Mongkut), made her portrayal of Anna Leonowens truly memorable. \\"The King and I\\" received nine Academy Award nominations and won five, including Best Actor for Yul Brynner. Over the years, the musical has continued to hold a special place in the hearts of many viewers and is considered one of the most cherished movie musicals of all time. Some of its most famous songs include \\"Getting to Know You,\\" \\"Shall We Dance?\\" and \\"Hello, Young Lovers\\". Deborah Kerr's unforgettable performance in \\"The King and I\\" cemented her status as a noted Hollywood actress and contributed significantly to the film's lasting impact on movie history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As Ferguson goes, so goes the nation. What happens to a national crisis now? As Missouri goes, so goes the nation. My history teacher taught us that when I was 16 years old. It was in Missouri, after all, where Dred Scott sued for his freedom, where the US supreme court would take up his case and declare that black men “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect”. As Ferguson goes, so goes the nation. The year 2014 taught us that. It was in Ferguson, after all, where fast-food workers at McDonald’s protested for higher wages, where the St Louis-area fry cooks get told “that’s all you deserve, that’s all you need”. It was Missouri that joined the union as a slave state on 10 August 1821, then voted against secession and remained with the union, then witnessed a bloody massacre between secessionist and union loyalists. It was Ferguson that fired the black superintendent of its schools in March, as a town with a 70% black population and a 97% white police force remained a town with an 85% white city council and a white mayor who ran unopposed, then witnessed 6% of its eligible black voters participate in the last election. Why is Ferguson, Missouri, of all places, still the bellwether for our national conversation around race and representation? Why is Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of 21,000, just now the place to bear witness to assembly, to free speech, to free press, to democracy in action? Why Ferguson? Why not Ferguson? The protests of the killing of Michael Brown began while his body lay out on the street for four hours. In the nearly two weeks since, a nation has watched a gathering of outrage as civil action. For every act of civil disobedience, Ferguson and the St Louis County law enforcement community have met the protesters with force. They brought dogs and guns, tanks and teargas. They immediately feared the black and brown citizens of their small municipality – of just 21,000 – simply because black anger and outrage frightened them. For every scared cop, there was a little war. Their reaction to the black body became a microcosm for American malice. So Ferguson is where the shit goes down. Where goes the nation now? And in Missouri, they have a questionable track record. Last year, in 86% of traffic stops and searches, 92% of those searches were of black citizens, while police officers were less likely to discover contraband on black drivers (22% black versus 34% white). In 2009, Ferguson police allegedly beat an innocent man and charged him with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms. Nearly two weeks of excessive policing and harassment in Ferguson proves that the black body in public space is still criminal before innocent. Police must replace an ex officio policy of intimidation with a show of respect for the lives of people in the communities they protect equal to that of their own. The St Louis County prosecutor appears sympathetic to law enforcement, the Ferguson mayor is in denial about any racial divisions in his town, and the governor is reticent to exert his powers to appoint a special prosecutor in responding to calls from Ferguson residents and a state senator. St Louis County, with over 90 towns and suburbs sprung from decades of housing desegregation struggles, is a balkanized republic, and law enforcement has acted as an arm to reinforce these divisions by targeting blacks citizens for crossing town lines. If a resident of Ferguson can be arrested for standing on her front lawn, what is freedom then? If a working man in Missouri can’t make it to the protest before the curfew, what good is his right to assemble? If a citizen of America is confined to a kind of house arrest where teargas seeps through the window-cracks, what does it mean to be an American anymore? And if we are a nation of laws, shouldn’t they also apply to law enforcement when they act in error? The brazen lack of transparency by authorities in Ferguson is what set tempers aflame. An unarmed 18-year-old with his hands up in surrender was shot to death by a police officer; the public simply wanted to know why, the people wanted simple accountability. In the absence of trust, we turn to federal oversight. Attorney general Eric Holder is a temporary balm to a fractured community, promising to “work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public” in “bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve”. But his justice department must do better: we don’t need a bridge – we need tectonics. The mayor of Ferguson wants to the diversify the police force, to invest in programs for schools and businesses. Community leaders and residents of Missouri engaged in civil disobedience want to use the momentum – the relative calm of the last couple nights – to nurture reflective new leaders. America wants to look in the rearview mirror and look forward at the same time. Brown will finally be laid to rest on Monday. His family will be waiting months for answers or even a charge for Darren Wilson, the man who killed their son. His American family will be doing the good and grimy work of correcting the fault lines of race and class – filling the unbridged space that was always there in all our Fergusons, all our Missouris. We will bear witness all over again, with our eyes open.

It highlights the historical significance of Missouri in the context of the civil rights movement and race relations in the United States. It also points out the continuing issues facing African Americans in Ferguson and the greater St. Louis area, such as excessive policing and racial targeting. The article focuses on the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson. The incident sparked a nationwide debate about race, policing, and the use of force, as well as protests in the streets of Ferguson. The author argues that incidents such as these demonstrate that black people are still seen as \\"criminal before innocent\\" and that law enforcement must show respect for all citizens' lives. The article examines the conflicts between law enforcement and the black community in Ferguson, as well as the larger issues of systemic racism and inequality present in the United States. It stresses the need for the Department of Justice to take more significant action to address these problems, rather than simply acting as a \\"temporary balm.\\" Lastly, the article outlines the efforts of community leaders, residents, and politicians to address these issues and work towards a brighter future for all Americans, including Michael Brown's family.

Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

MARIANNA, Florida (CNN) -- Leaning against his cane, Bryant Middleton shuffled toward the makeshift cemetery. Tears welled in his eyes as he leaned down to touch one of the crosses.  Bryant Middleton kneels by a row of white crosses on the grounds of a former reform school he attended.  \\"This shouldn't be,\\" he said. \\"This shouldn't be.\\"  Thirty-one crosses made of tubular steel and painted white line up unevenly in the grass and weeds of what used to be the grounds of a reform school in Marianna, Florida. The anonymous crosses are rusting away but their secrets may soon be exposed.  When boys disappeared from the school, administrators explained it away, said former student Roger Kiser.  They'd say, \\"Well, he ran away and the swamp got him,\\" Kiser recalled. Or, \\"The gators got him.\\" Or, 'Water moccasins got him.\\"  Kiser and other former students believe authorities will soon find the remains of children and teens sent to the Florida School for Boys half a century ago. Watch Middleton kneel by the crosses »  On the orders of Gov. Charlie Crist, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement last week opened an investigation to determine if anyone is buried here, whether crimes were committed, and if so, who was responsible.  A group of men in their 60s, who once attended the school, have told investigators they believe the bodies are classmates who disappeared after being savagely beaten by administrators and workers.  The FDLE is just beginning its investigation, so there is no way to know if there is any truth to the allegations. The investigation will be challenging.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food. Suggested answer: Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"To verify the suggested answer, let's address the original question step-by-step. Question: How does an earthworm eat and digest food? Step 1: Understand the question To provide a relevant answer, we need to explain the process by which an earthworm ingests and breaks down food. Step 2: Address eating (ingestion) An earthworm eats by ingesting soil and organic matter through its mouth. It has a muscular pharynx that helps to suck in soil and food particles. Step 3: Address digestion Once food is ingested, it travels through the earthworm's digestive system, which includes the pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. In the crop, food is temporarily stored. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions and tiny stones ingested along with the soil help to grind the food. Once the food is ground up into smaller particles, it then enters the intestine, where enzymes break down the food molecules into even smaller molecules which can be absorbed by the earthworm's body. Step 4: Evaluate the suggested answer The suggested answer, \\"Digestion is a form of catabolism: a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones,\\" can be considered accurate as it refers to the general process of breaking down food molecules. However, it does not specifically address the process in earthworms nor how they eat, which was the main focus of the question. Answer: To properly validate an answer for this question, it is essential to mention details about how an earthworm specifically ingests and digests food. While the suggested answer is accurate regarding the general concept of digestion, it fails to address the question in the context of earthworms. Therefore, I would not validate the given answer. Instead, provide an answer that accurately explains the process of ingestion and digestion in earthworms, like the one outlined in steps 2 and 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Saudi Arabia has reportedly told the Obama administration and congressional leaders that it will sell billions of dollars in U.S. financial assets if Congress passes a bill to make the Saudi government legally responsible for any role in the 9/11 attacks.      The administration has tried to stop Congress from passing the legislation, a bipartisan Senate bill, since Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir last month told Washington lawmakers his country’s position, according to The New York Times.      Al-Jubeir purportedly informed the lawmakers during a trip to Washington that Saudi Arabia would be forced to sell as much as 750 billion in Treasury securities and other American financial assets on the world market, fearing the legislation could become law and U.S. courts would then freeze the assets.      The revelations about the Saudis’ ultimatum come several days after reports that President Obama will soon decide whether to declassify 28 pages of sealed documents suspected of showing a Saudi connection to the deadly 9/11 terror attacks.      Former Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham told Fox News on Tuesday that the White House told him a decision on whether to declassify the documents would be made within 60 days.      Graham helped lead a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks.      The Bush and Obama administrations have refused to unseal the documents, arguing their release would jeopardize national security.      Critics claim the reluctance is a calculated move to hide Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the al Qaeda terror attack that killed almost 3,000 people on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001.      The Saudi government has said it wants the pages declassified.      Obama had come under renewed pressure to release the documents ahead of a scheduled trip next week to Saudi Arabia for a summit of Persian Gulf leaders.      Economists are purportedly skeptical about the Saudis making good on their vow to sell the assets, considering such a move would be difficult to execute and could severely hurt that country’s economy, which depends on the U.S. dollar.      The separate 9/11 Commission essentially found no evidence that the Saudi Arabia government supported the attacks.      However, the commission’s narrowly worded finding about having “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization” has skeptic suggesting that lesser officials government operatives or were involved. ||||| Saudi Arabia appears to be blackmailing the US, saying it would sell off American assets worth a 12-digit figure sum in dollars if Congress passes a bill allowing the Saudi government to be held responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.      The warning was delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir last month during a visit to Washington, the New York Times reported. He said his country would sell up to 750 billion in US treasury securities and other assets before the bill puts them in jeopardy.      The newspaper said Riyadh's resolve to actually deliver on the threat is dubious, since selling off those assets would be technically challenging and would damage the dollar, against which the Saudi national currency is pegged.      Read more      Under the current US law, foreign nations have a degree of immunity from being sued in American courts. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 is one of the reasons why families of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks largely failed to bring to court the Saudi royal family and charities over suspicion of financially supporting the attacks.      The bill introduced in the Senate would waiver the immunity for cases involving terrorist attacks that kill US citizens on US soil. Introduced by Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, it managed to overcome partisan divisions in the US legislation and passed without dissent through the Judiciary Committee in January.      “As our nation confronts new and expanding terror networks that are targeting our citizens, stopping the funding source for terrorists becomes even more important,” Senator Cornyn said last month.      Possible links between the perpetrators of the attack and Saudi Arabia may be hiding in 28 classified pages of the 2002 congressional report on 9/11, which allegedly describe how Saudi Arabian nationals with links to the government financially assisted the 19 hijackers who flew airplanes into World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Many people, including the co-author of the redacted pages, former Florida Senator Bob Graham, have been campaigning for years to make them public.      The Obama administration is opposing the bill, saying it would make foreign nations retaliate by passing similar legislation and target American citizens and corporations in their national courts. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel in February that the bill, in its current form, would “expose the United States of America to lawsuits and take away our sovereign immunity and create a terrible precedent.”      Read more      Ironically, sovereign immunity didn't stop a US judge from last month ordering Iran to pay 10.5 billion in damages to families of the 9/11 victims. The ruling was passed because Iran didn't defend itself against the allegations. These put the blame on Iran over its links with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which, plaintiffs argued, aided Al-Qaeda. The argument is based on the same congressional report, which also said no link between the hijackers and Iran had been found.      None of the 19 hijackers were Iranian citizens. Fifteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, while two were from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Egypt and Lebanon.      Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter regional rivals, adhering to competing sects of Islam and battling for position in the Muslim world. The US had been a stalwart supporter of Saudi Arabia and opponent of Iran, which overthrew the US-backed Shah in 1979 and became an Islamic republic.      Washington's cordial relations with Riyadh chilled somewhat as it sought a thaw with Tehran last year, participating in a deal to resolve the controversy over Iran's nuclear program. |||||Summary:","output":"Saudi Arabia has reportedly warned the Obama administration that if Congress passes a bill that could make the Saudi government legally responsible for any role in the 9/11 attacks, it will sell billions of dollars in US financial assets.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation.

Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn?  Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. A:","output":"Jennifer would likely see more sunsets in Malarn. According to the provided information, Malarn regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean.

The primary distinction between these two sentences lies in the order in which the prepositional phrases of time and place are presented. The meaning, however, remains consistent: both sentences convey that Amish Mennonites with Swiss ancestry from Galicia settled near Dubno in the year 1815."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The question is asking what makes someone not legally able to purchase alcohol. Here's why \\"underage\\" is the best choice: 1. Underage: This option directly addresses the legal age restrictions placed on buying alcohol. In most countries, there is a minimum legal drinking age (e.g., 21 years in the United States, 18 years in the United Kingdom and Australia, 16 years in some European countries), and people below this age are considered underage. Underage individuals are not allowed to buy alcohol based on these laws aimed at protecting them from the potential negative effects of alcohol consumption. 2. Banned: Although an individual could theoretically be banned from a particular venue or location from buying alcohol, this is not inherently related to age restrictions or the legality of alcohol purchases across the board. Personal bans are usually situational and not based on a broad legal context. 3. Adult: Since adults are often legally able to purchase alcohol, selecting this option would not make sense in the context of the question. 4. Rules: While this term is somewhat relevant to the discussion of legality, it is too vague to be an accurate answer. The question is asking about a specific reason someone cannot legally buy alcohol, whereas rules could encompass many different regulations. 5. Black market: This option focuses more on the illegal sale or distribution of alcohol rather than the legal age requirement for an individual to purchase alcohol. While the black market involves the circumvention of regulations, it is not a reason or feature that disqualifies someone from legally buying alcohol as in the case of being underage. Therefore, a human would choose \\"underage\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and straightforward option that accurately explains the primary reason someone would not be legally allowed to buy alcohol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: BRIC markets grow in appeal for retailers CHICAGO (Reuters) - For global retailers that are looking to find new consumers away from their saturated home markets, the road to growth is increasingly being paved with BRICs. But Brazil, Russia, India and China -- which make up the BRIC acronym for hot emerging markets -- have differing landscapes in terms of infrastructure, regulation, consumer tastes and how well foreign companies are welcome to the markets, according to a study by Euromonitor International. That means expansion into at least some of those countries is more about creating long-term opportunities than immediate returns, Matthew Stych, director of retail research for Euromonitor, said in an interview ahead of the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit. \\"It's almost like they are putting down a place marker for future growth,\\" Stych said. In 2006, the BRIC countries accounted for 11 percent of global retail sales, up 2.4 percentage points from 2001. By the end of 2011, it is expected that the BRICs will account for almost 13 percent. \\"Brazil, Russia, China and India rank among the most attractive emerging markets, thanks to the huge size of their potential customer bases,\\" Euromonitor said in a report last month. The report also noted that the markets have grown more important as retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N: Quote, Profile, Research), Carrefour (CARR.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) and Tesco Plc (TSCO.L: Quote, Profile, Research) focus more on specific markets rather than putting down flags all over the world hoping that growth will come. In the past, some multinational retailers have stumbled when they moved into new markets. Wal-Mart famously failed to connect with German shoppers and eventually left that market and Wal-Mart and Carrefour both pulled out of South Korea after they failed to open enough stores to become significant players, Euromonitor said. © Reuters 2007.

Here's a detailed explanation as to why this occurs: Rainfall typically results from the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. As moist air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. These clouds become saturated with water droplets and, eventually, precipitation in the form of rain. The presence of rain also means that clouds are abundant, and they play a dominant role in reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground. Clouds are effective at scattering and absorbing sunlight, which leads to a decrease in the amount of direct sunlight that penetrates the cloud layer and reaches the Earth's surface. Thick rain-bearing clouds, such as cumulonimbus or nimbostratus, are particularly adept at blocking sunlight due to their high density and large water content. The decrease in sunlight during the rainy season also has several consequences on the environment: 1. Reduced solar radiation: With less sunlight reaching the ground, the amount of solar radiation available to the ecosystem reduces. This affects various natural processes that depend on sunlight, such as photosynthesis and evaporation. 2. Lower temperatures: A drop in sunlight typically corresponds to a decrease in air temperatures. This is because the Earth's surface absorbs less solar radiation, which results in less heating. Consequently, cooler temperatures are often experienced during the rainy season. 3. Altered ecosystems: Decreased sunlight availability affects the local flora and fauna in numerous ways. For example, the reduced levels of sunlight limit the growth of some plants, which may lead to changes in the species composition of the ecosystem. Additionally, the altered environment caused by the rain and decreased sunlight can affect animal behavior and population dynamics. 4. Increased humidity and reduced evaporation rates: The abundance of water vapor in the air during the rainy season already contributes to high humidity levels, but the decrease in sunlight further limits the rate of evaporation. This enhances the humid conditions in the environment, which can impact both ecosystems and human comfort. In summary, during the rainy season in a city, the amount of sunlight available is likely to decrease due to the increased cloud cover and precipitation. This reduction in sunlight has various implications on the environment, including alterations in temperature, humidity, and the functioning of ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Nevertheless, Darius Reynaud returned the ensuing kickoff for 73 yards, giving Adrian Peterson the opportunity to rush 23 yards in two plays to level the scores at 7-7. Olindo Mare and Ryan Longwell then traded field goals to make the scores 10-10 at halftime. Another field goal from Mare put the Seahawks ahead on their first drive of the second half, but the Vikings responded with a 25-yard touchdown pass from Sage Rosenfels to new wide receiver Javon Walker with just over seven minutes left in the game. Minnesota sealed the win with less than three minutes on the clock, when Joe Webb tossed the ball seven yards for fullback Ryan D'Imperio to return the Vikings to a winning preseason record.

As you and your dad try to foster a healthier relationship, work on talking to him every day.  Find time to talk every day. You can talk to your dad at the dinner table, or after he gets home from work. You do not always have to have a serious discussion. You can simply talk about your day at school. If your dad did something to hurt your feelings, make sure to let him know. You want to make sure he knows if he's continuing to pick on you and upset you. It's possible your dad may not improve. Your dad may have problems with anger or stress management. You may need to see a family counselor to figure out how to best address the issue and form a healthier family dynamic. You may want to talk to a counselor at your school before talking to your parents. Your counselor can help advise you on how to bring up family counseling, and may even be able to talk to your parents for you. Parents screw up sometimes, and may accidentally pick on their children. However, if your dad is routinely making you uncomfortable, you may be the victim of emotional abuse. It's important to figure out if you are being emotionally abused so you can take action to end the abuse.  Your dad may ignore you when you do not behave the way he wants. He may not look at you or call you by name. Your dad may prevent you from seeing friends. He may not allow you to have a normal social life. This is to keep you isolated and away from others. Your dad may talk to you in a way that is traumatizing. He may ridicule you or curse at you. He may call you things like \\"stupid\\" or \\"worthless.\\" He may also do things to scare you, like placing a pet or a sibling in a dangerous situation. It's important you tell someone about abuse, as it can be very damaging over the longterm. Emotional abuse may also eventually turn into physical abuse. Tell another adult relative, the parent of a friend, or a trusted teacher or counselor at school what is going on. These adults should be able to find you the resources you need to get away from an abusive situation. If you do not have an adult you feel you can trust, try calling Childhelp USA. This is an organization that seeks to help children who are being physically or emotionally abused by a parent. You can call at (800) 4-A-CHILD.

During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her.  Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, \\"Substitutiary Locomotion,\\" is missing. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the rest of the book. They are approached by Swinburne, who takes them to the Bookman, who possesses the remainder of the book. They exchange their pieces, but learn only the spell was inscribed on a medallion, the Star of Astaroth, that belonged to a sorcerer of that name. The Bookman reveals the medallion may have been taken by a pack of wild animals, given anthropomorphism by Astaroth, to a remote island called Naboombu. It was said in the 17th century, a lascar claimed he saw Naboombu. The Bookman, however, does not believe the island exists, as he looked in every chart for it, until Paul confirms its existence via a storybook.

Options: - least - much - bog - lot of - big  The answer is \\"big\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"big\\". In language terminology, antonyms are words that have contrasting, or opposite, meanings. Therefore, when examining the semantic connection between the words \\"little\\" and \\"big\\", we find they are antonyms. Here's why: \\"Little\\" is generally defined as small in size, amount, or degree. The term is used to depict something that is not large or significant in some way and is often used to describe physical size, amounts, and structures or items. This relates to its usage in sentences like \\"That's a little book\\" or \\"There's little food left.\\" On the other hand, the term \\"big\\" is used to describe something that is large in size, volume, amount, or degree. It represents a condition where an item or situation is considerably above the average or ordinary in scope or magnitude. This reflects its use in phrases like \\"That's a big house\\" or \\"There's a big difference between the two.\\" Therefore, by their inherent and generally accepted meanings, \\"big\\" is the correct antithetical term to \\"little\\" because it represents the exact inverse - large instead of small.  Let's take a glance at the other options as well for completeness: - \\"Least\\" is not an exact antonym to \\"little.\\" \\"Least\\" is the superlative form of \\"less\\" and often suggests a lower degree or the lowest degree of something. Moreover, \\"least\\" generally does not reflect physical size, unlike \\"little.\\"    - \\"Much\\" can indicate a large quantity, volume or degree of something, but it does not directly refer to physical size. Therefore, it is not as precise an antonym for \\"little,\\" which often implies small in physical dimensions. - \\"Bog\\" is a word that signifies a wet, muddy ground too soft to support a heavy body. It does not represent an antonym for \\"little.\\" - \\"Lot of\\" could mean a large amount in quantity but does not suggest anything about the physical size, making it an unsuitable direct antonym for \\"little.\\" Given this analysis, the correct answer is \\"big.\\" It mirrors the opposite meaning of \\"little\\" encompassing all its uses, particularly those referring to physical dimension, making it the most accurate choice from the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Identity attack refers to anything rude or disrespectful about someone's identity, including appearance, race, gender, and sexual orientation. Comment: ' You can see what the traitorous Trump likes about Zinke,  He's quite like Trump.  Buffoonish. . A:","output":"This task involves evaluating a given public comment and deciding whether it falls under the categories of identity-attack or non-identity-attack.  An identity-attack comment is one that contains rude or disrespectful content about a person’s identity, which could pertain to their appearance, race, gender, or sexual orientation. A non-identity-attack comment, on the other hand, may contain criticism, disagreements, or opinions, but it does not directly attack anyone's personal identity. Step 1: Read the Comment  Begin by carefully reading the given comment. Try to understand the overall tone, context and the key subjects brought up in the comment. Step 2: Classifying the Comment Based on what you read and understand, decide if it shows disrespect or rudeness towards someone's identity. Are there any implications about the person's appearance, race, gender, or sexual orientation that could be considered disrespectful or rude? If so, the comment would be classified as an \\"identity attack\\". If not, it is a \\"non-identity-attack\\". Please note, critique or disagreement alone does not necessarily equate to an identity attack. The comment should personally and directly offend someone’s identity to be classified as an “identity attack”. In the given comment where someone discusses qualities of a public figure, it does not contain disrespect or rudeness towards any personal identities. It would be classified as non-identity-attack. Even though the comment may appear negative, it does not disrespect or attack an individual's race, gender, appearance, or sexual orientation. Thus, it falls under the category of non-identity-attack.  Remember that the objective of this task is to identify comments that are specifically offensive towards someone’s personal identity, and not to judge the propriety, politeness or agreeability of comments in general."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

This process plays an essential role in growth, development, and tissue repair within multicellular organisms. Mitosis consists of four major phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. As mentioned in the answer above, the DNA condenses into chromosomes, which then align at the center of the cell. The daughter chromosomes separate and move to the opposite poles of the cell, followed by the cell membrane splitting to form two new cells. On the other hand, meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms. The purpose of this process is to produce haploid gametes (sperm in males and eggs in females) with half the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Meiosis consists of two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. In total, there are eight distinct phases, which include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase for both meiosis I, and II. There are several distinguishing features between mitosis and meiosis: 1. Purpose: Mitosis is crucial for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms, while meiosis ensures genetic diversity through sexual reproduction. 2. Number of divisions: Mitosis involves a single cell division, whereas meiosis involves two consecutive divisions, resulting in four unique haploid cells. 3. Number of daughter cells: Mitosis produces two identical diploid cells, while meiosis creates four genetically diverse haploid cells. 4. Genetic diversity: Mitosis generates genetically identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis involves genetic variation through processes like crossing over and independent assortment, producing genetically unique gametes. 5. Occurrence: Mitosis occurs in all body cells (somatic cells) with the exception of sex cells, whereas meiosis occurs only in sex cells (germ cells). In conclusion, differentiating between mitosis and meiosis involves understanding the distinctions in their purpose, number of divisions, daughter cells produced, genetic diversity, and occurrence within the organism. While both processes involve cell division and replication of genetic material, they serve different functions and outcomes in multicellular organisms."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Se väite, että Euroopan unioni ei WTO-sopimusten mukaan saa laajentaa öljykasviensa viljelyalaa, on kestämätön. Translate to English","output":"The claim that, according to WTO agreements, the European Union is not allowed to expand its oilseed cultivation area is unsustainable. This statement argues that, based on World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, the European Union (EU) cannot increase the area allotted for oilseed crop cultivation. However, this argument is deemed to be unsustainable, for various reasons. First, it is essential to understand that the WTO's primary goal is to facilitate international trade by reducing trade barriers, tariffs, and other obstacles between countries. It does not regulate domestic agricultural policies directly. However, the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) indirectly affects these policies by imposing certain limits on domestic support and export subsidies. This agreement aims to help member countries to create a level playing field and prevent distortions in global agricultural trade. In the context of oilseed cultivation in the EU, it is crucial to consider that the expansion of such agricultural activities may be more influenced by region-specific policies rather than WTO agreements. For example, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a significant role in shaping agricultural practices within its member states, providing financial support, ensuring food security, and maintaining the environmental sustainability of farming. In recent years, the EU has been encouraging the growth of oilseed crops, such as rapeseed and sunflower, in response to increasing global demand for vegetable oils, mainly for the production of biodiesel. Furthermore, crop diversification and achieving environmental goals have become priorities for EU agriculture, which could provide incentives for oilseed expansion. When looking into the WTO's agreements, there are no explicit provisions prohibiting a member country from expanding its oilseed cultivation area. The EU's oilseed farming activities are largely subject to demonstrating their compliance with environmental, sanitary, and other regulations imposed by the WTO and their consistency with the principles of fair trade. Additionally, under the WTO rules, any expansion of oilseed cultivation by the EU must adhere to the limits of domestic support to avoid distorting global markets. Provided the EU complies with these regulations, the expansion of oilseed production is not explicitly forbidden. Given these factors, the claim that the EU cannot expand its oilseed cultivation area according to WTO agreements appears to be unsustainable and not rooted in the actual regulations imposed by the organization. While compliance with certain limits and rules is necessary for maintaining fair trade principles, there is no outright ban on increasing oilseed cultivation. The EU's decisions regarding its agricultural policies and oilseed expansion, therefore, depend more on internal policies and evaluating the environmental, economic, and social implications associated with such actions."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

Question: Who is the Special Activities Division operative? Title: Spy Game Movie plot: Set in 1991, the film depicts the U.S. and Chinese Governments on the verge of a major trade agreement, with the American President due to pay a visit to China to seal the deal. The Central Intelligence Agency gets word that their Special Activities Division operative Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been captured trying to free an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), from a Chinese prison near Su Chou (Suzhou). Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed within twenty-four hours unless he is claimed by the U.S. Government, so they scramble to decide what to doif they claim Bishop as an agent, they risk destroying the trade agreement. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that Bishop was operating in a \\"rogue\\" capacity without permission from the Agency.In an attempt to quickly deal with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement, and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir that they simply need him to act as a \\"stop gap\\" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are in reality hoping that what he gives them is the smoking gun they need to justify letting Bishop die. Realizing as much, Muir attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to CNN through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that the CIA will rescue Tom once a public outcry puts pressure on them to do so. Unfortunately for Muir, the tactic only stalls them, as a phone call to the FCC from a high ranking executive results in CNN retracting the story.During the debriefing, referred to above, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop into the MACV-SOG while the latter was an Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam. Muir also discusses their tour of duty in Berlin in 1975. Both sub-plots are given extensive time in the film. Considerable time is also devoted to Muir and Bishop's spy work in Lebanon that culminated to a plot similar to that of the 1985 Beirut car bombing the aftermath of which led to the last time...

The United States Virgin Islands (USVI; also called the American Virgin Islands), officially the Virgin Islands of the United States, is a group of islands in the Caribbean that is an insular area of the United States located 40 miles (64 km) east of Puerto Rico. The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. It is the easternmost point (in terms of jurisdiction) and territory of the United States. What's the best answer to this question: is the us virgin islands part of the usa? Pick your answer from: - no - yes...A:","output":"A: Yes, the US Virgin Islands is part of the USA. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which means that while it is not a state, it still falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is subject to U.S. federal laws. The USVI consists of several Caribbean islands, including Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, along with many smaller islands. Residents of the US Virgin Islands are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote for the U.S. President in the general elections, and the islands do not have full representation in the United States Congress. The people of the USVI do, however, elect a non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, who can participate in debates and vote in committee meetings but cannot vote on the final passage of bills. The USVI has a local government that operates under a constitution approved by the U.S. Congress. There is a governor who is the chief executive of the territory, a unicameral legislature with 15 members, and a judiciary that includes a superior court and a supreme court. While the legal system in the US Virgin Islands is based on U.S. federal law and the U.S. Constitution, the territory is allowed to have its territorial laws and regulations. In terms of economy, the US Virgin Islands relies heavily on tourism, with more than two million visitors annually contributing to its economy. Other significant industries include rum production, trade, and manufacturing. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of the territory, and English is the most widely spoken language, although Virgin Islands Creole is also spoken. It is important to note that while the US Virgin Islands is indeed part of the United States, it maintains a separate customs territory from the mainland U.S. This means that it has its customs regulations and duties for goods entering or leaving the territory. However, travelers from the US Virgin Islands to mainland U.S. do not need a passport, as the journey is considered domestic travel. In conclusion, the US Virgin Islands is part of the United States, albeit as an unincorporated territory. While it enjoys a degree of self-governance, it is subject to U.S. federal laws, its residents are U.S. citizens, and the territory is the easternmost point of U.S. jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that.

Boasts: Jihadists fighting with terror squads in Iraq are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics, such as British IS fighter Reyaad Khan seen posing with a man tied to railings. British jihadists fighting with terror squads in Iraq are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics. The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah. Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’ They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad. After one British teenager wrote of having a ‘bad feeling I can’t hack it there and my family will want me to come back’, British jihadist Abu Farris replied: ‘We’re all bros here. Trust me, don’t be scared. 15-year-olds can hack it bro, so why can’t you. It is from Allah.’ And the chilling posts reveal they are advising them down to the smallest detail on how to prepare for travelling to the region – from where to get guns and bulletproof vests to what trainers they should bring and how to avoid being bitten by bugs at night. The revelations raise urgent questions for the security services over whether enough is being done to prevent the spread of radical Islamic  ideology among British teenagers. Young British Muslims are now known to be among the IS terror squads besieging the area around Mount Sinjar where thousands of refugees are trapped, the Mail can reveal. Intelligence officers have identified UK nationals as being part of the fanatical IS army that has swept across northern Iraq, carrying out a horrifying catalogue of medieval war crimes. Scroll down for video. Before they fled: Jihadists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (circled) hand out food to the needy in Cardiff last year. Both have been tweeting about their involvement with IS while on the front line. The. British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Reyaad Khan and Nasser. Muthana, the 20-year-olds from Cardiff who notoriously featured in a. jihad recruitment video for the group. The former Catholic college students. have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from. across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of. whom have already been killed. Using Twitter, social media site  Ask.fm and smartphone apps, the jihadists are posting disturbing updates on their progress. Uploads. have included pictures of mass executions, beheadings, child soldiers. and selfies with men captured and tied to railings in the oppressive. heat. A British girl who has gone to Syria also posted a picture of. herself in the area, wearing a niqab and with a gun by her side. Some of the British jihadists command followers to ‘make hijrah’ – an Arabic term meaning emigration. They boast about what weapons they are using and offer advice on how to get into Syria and where to buy guns. If those messaging them appear  serious about joining IS, they send private messages on mobile apps Kik and Surespot, which they claim are encrypted and impossible for authorities to monitor. It is thought about 500 British nationals have travelled to the region. United Nations War Crimes investigators said they are monitoring Islamic State online postings. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment last night. Ask.fm and Kik were unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Surespot said: ‘Any technology has the potential for abuse by nefarious individuals. ‘For example, digital cameras can be used for child porn but they can also be used to take lovely pictures. Are we then to stop selling them? ‘In the same vein, are we supposed to give governments access to all of our private information?’ The Home Office said it is aware of the IS propaganda online and is working with social media companies to remove extremist material. A spokesman added: ‘We do not tolerate the existence of online terrorist and extremist propaganda. ‘We work with the internet industry to remove terrorist material hosted in the UK or overseas.’ One British fighter, Abu Farris, took to  the website Ask.fm – criticised for failing to crack down on harmful content – to convince radicalised youths to join him. Here are some  of his slang-filled posts from his question-and-answer session:. Q: Don’t you miss your mum? Why don’t you just be a British Muslim and live in peace?  A: Of course I miss my mum, I’ll see her in jannah [paradise] if Allah accepts me. Regardless of how we feel, its obligatory.

OPTIONS: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","output":"a). yes; The premise and the hypothesis very closely align each other in their meanings and implications.  In the premise, \\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act,\\" suggests that Beresford is expressing the idea that unless Sir James Peel Edgerton is observed committing a wrongful action, there would be no valid reason to think him guilty. The hypothesis, \\"Beresford said that I would never believe in the guilt of Sir James Peel Edgerton unless he had been caught red-handed,\\" also aligns well with the statement from the premise. Here, being \\"caught red-handed\\" is equivalent to the concept of being \\"caught in the act\\" from the premise. Both phrases refer to the necessity of irrefutable evidence (such as catching someone in the middle of performing the wrongful action) to be convinced of Sir James Peel Edgerton's guilt. So, based on the premise provided, we can conclude the hypothesis: \\"Beresford said that I would never believe in the guilt of Sir James Peel Edgerton unless he had been caught red-handed,\\" is true.

Combine the x terms: -20x - 13x can be combined into a single term: -33x. So the equation becomes: -198 = -33x 2. Isolate the variable x: To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is -33. -198 / -33 = (-33x) / -33 3. Solve for x: Divide -198 by -33: -198 / -33 = 6 So the equation -198 = -33x becomes 6 = x. 4. Check the result: To double-check the correctness of the obtained result, substitute x with 6 back into the original equation: -198 = -20*(6) - 13*(6) -198 = -120 - 78 -198 = -198 Since the two sides of the equation match, the solution x=6 is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief Options:  A. not enough information  B. Because they may denuclearize  C.

I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that \\"I, Robot\\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too). I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \\"retread\\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others). \\"I, Robot\\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis).

Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite.","output":"Based on the information provided, Ecuador is the country that causes more dead zones in the ocean. Here are the steps and justifications for this conclusion: Step 1: Identifying the cause of dead zones The main cause of dead zones in the ocean is the harmful entry of chemicals or particles, often resulting from disposing of waste and chemical fertilizers in rivers. These rivers then carry these pollutants to the ocean, where they contribute to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. Step 2: Evaluating the environmental practices of each country Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste, which is a major contributor to the creation of dead zones.

Article: Chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65. Question: What instrument did Auguste Franchomme play?","output":"Auguste Franchomme was a renowned cellist during the Romantic era and was closely associated with the famed composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin. Born in Lille, France in 1808, Auguste Joseph Franchomme became one of the leading cellists of his time. Franchomme performed the cello, which is a bowed string instrument known for its versatility and ability to cover a wide range of pitches. It is part of the violin family of instruments and is positioned between the violin and the double bass in terms of size and pitch range. In the given article, it is mentioned that Franchomme collaborated with Chopin in his last Paris concert in February 1848. During this concert, Franchomme played the cello alongside Chopin's piano accompaniment, showcasing their musical prowess together. Specifically, they performed three movements of Chopin's composition, the Cello Sonata Op. 65, which was written for cello and piano and is one of the few chamber music pieces by Chopin. Franchomme's skill and artistry on the cello brought him wide recognition. He was a sought-after performer and teacher, working with many other famous musicians of his time. Additionally, Franchomme was a composer in his own right and contributed to the cello repertoire with his own études, caprices, and other works. In conclusion, Auguste Franchomme played the cello, a bowed string instrument from the violin family. He was a skilled musician, known for his collaboration with Chopin and other notable artists, and contributed to the world of classical music with his own compositions dedicated to the cello."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what causes human disease?\\" is \\"uV\\", given that  influenza causes human disease? Pick your answer from: (I). Yes; (II). No; Answer:","output":"Answer: (II). No. Although the specific cause of human disease in the question is \\"influenza,\\" it is important to delve further into the topic to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of human diseases. Influenza is certainly one cause of human disease, but it is only one example among various types of diseases afflicting humans. Human diseases can be classified into two broad categories: infectious and non-infectious. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, while non-infectious diseases can be caused by genetic factors, lifestyle choices, or environmental factors, among others. In the case of influenza, the cause is a virus, which is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets. However, several other factors can affect an individual's susceptibility to infection and disease progression, including age, immune system function, and overall health. In contrast, non-infectious diseases are not contagious and are caused by a wide array of factors. For instance, genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis result from mutations in specific genes inherited from both parents. Lifestyle choices – such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and tobacco or alcohol consumption – can contribute to chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Environmental factors, such as exposure to pollutants or toxins, can also play a crucial role in the development of various diseases. It is also essential to consider that some diseases can be influenced by an interplay of multiple factors. For example, autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are thought to develop due to a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and immune system dysfunction. Therefore, while \\"uV\\" may refer to ultraviolet radiation (a type of electromagnetic radiation), it is not the correct answer to the question of what causes human disease because human diseases arise from complex multifactorial interactions. Influenza is one cause of human disease but far from the only cause. It is crucial to recognize the diverse factors affecting human health and the myriad ways these factors can combine to cause disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above?

MARTIN MAKES A DISCOVERY OF SOME IMPORTANCE  From Mr Moddle to Eden is an easy and natural transition. Mr Moddle, living in the atmosphere of Miss Pecksniff's love, dwelt (if he had but known it) in a terrestrial Paradise. The thriving city of Eden was also a terrestrial Paradise, upon the showing of its proprietors. The beautiful Miss Pecksniff might have been poetically described as a something too good for man in his fallen and degraded state. That was exactly the character of the thriving city of Eden, as poetically heightened by Zephaniah Scadder, General Choke, and other worthies; part and parcel of the talons of that great American Eagle, which is always airing itself sky-high in purest aether, and never, no never, never, tumbles down with draggled wings into the mud.  When Mark Tapley, leaving Martin in the architectural and surveying offices, had effectually strengthened and encouraged his own spirits by the contemplation of their joint misfortunes, he proceeded, with new cheerfulness, in search of help; congratulating himself, as he went along, on the enviable position to which he had at last attained.  'I used to think, sometimes,' said Mr Tapley, 'as a desolate island would suit me, but I should only have had myself to provide for there, and being naturally a easy man to manage, there wouldn't have been much credit in THAT. Now here I've got my partner to take care on, and he's something like the sort of man for the purpose. I want a man as is always a-sliding off his legs when he ought to be on 'em. I want a man as is so low down in the school of life that he's always a-making figures of one in his copy-book, and can't get no further.

Write an article with the title: \\"U.S. is inching closer to energy independence as oil imports shrink\\" Article:","output":"Title: U.S. Inching Closer to Energy Independence as Oil Imports Shrink Introduction: Driven by the combined efforts of increased domestic production and advancements in renewable energy, the United States has edged closer toward energy independence in recent years. One of the significant indicators for this progress is the steady decline in oil imports, making the U.S. less reliant on foreign markets. This article will explore the factors propelling this shift and the potential implications of this unprecedented move towards substantial American energy autonomy. The Surge in Domestic Oil Production: The U.S. energy landscape has experienced a resurgence in domestic production in the past decade, primarily driven by advances in technology. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up vast reserves of oil and natural gas in shale formations across the United States. The shale revolution has seen U.S. crude oil production increase from approximately 5 million barrels per day in 2008 to a record-breaking 12.8 million barrels per day in 2019. This growth has substantially reduced the country's dependence on oil imports from traditional suppliers such as OPEC nations and other global producers. The Impact of Renewables and Energy Efficiency: In addition to the boom in domestic oil production, the U.S. has made significant strides in developing renewable energy resources and improving energy efficiency. Wind and solar power capacity have grown exponentially over the past decade, contributing to a more diverse energy mix that reduces dependence on imported oil. Furthermore, investments in energy efficient technologies have helped curb demand for oil, as appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure require less energy to operate. The Declining Role of Oil Imports: As a result, oil imports have consistently shrunk over the past decade, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting that net imports of crude oil and petroleum products fell to 2.3 million barrels per day in 2019, from 11 million barrels per day in 2005. This marked a 79% reduction in oil imports in just 14 years. Additionally, the EIA predicts that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter by 2022. Implications for Energy Security and Foreign Policy: This trend toward energy independence has significant implications for U.S. energy security and foreign policy. As the country becomes less reliant on foreign oil, its vulnerability to fluctuations in global energy markets decreases. This newfound independence could mitigate the impact of geopolitical events on energy prices, dampening the repercussions of conflicts and economic crises on the nation's economy. Moreover, energy independence provides the U.S. with greater diplomatic leverage, as it no longer needs to depend on foreign suppliers with contentious political agendas. This shift could lead to a transformation of American foreign policy, with a focus on asserting national interests and promoting stability in strategic regions like the Middle East. Challenges and the Path Forward: Despite these promising developments, several challenges lie ahead in the quest for U.S. energy independence. The current administration's relaxed stance on environmental regulations and support for fossil fuel production have raised concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, achieving energy autonomy should not come at the expense of environmental sustainability. To maintain momentum in the transition toward energy independence, investments in renewable energy innovation, infrastructure, and electric vehicle production must continue. Furthermore, attention should be given to developing advanced energy storage systems to ensure the grid's reliability and resilience in the face of growing renewable energy sources. Conclusion: The United States' journey towards energy independence has been propelled by the surge in domestic oil production, the rapid growth of renewable energy sources, and gains in energy efficiency. As the nation continues to reduce its reliance on foreign oil imports, enhanced energy security and the potential for a more assertive foreign policy lie in the balance. To fully realize the benefits of this shift, continued investments in innovation, sustainability, and a diverse energy mix will be crucial to sustaining momentum in the push for American energy autonomy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It's sad that we can't just celebrate our nation's independence in a more civil way, you know? Brian: Yeah, it's crazy. Every year, it's the same thing – streets overcrowded, excessive noise, pollution from fireworks, and a bunch of accidents just waiting to happen. Steven: I completely agree. I'd love to have a quiet, meaningful celebration. Just picture it – a backyard barbecue with friends and family, people sharing stories of pride for our country, and maybe even a firecracker or two. You know, something small and intimate. Dave: That does sound nice – and way better than the current mess out there. But why can't we ever have that? What's preventing everything from being calmer and more organized? Brian: (shrugs) I guess it's just the surge of patriotism that takes people over, and it becomes a free-for-all. Plus, everyone has different ways of celebrating, so it's hard to find a unified and structured approach. Steven: Also, you can't forget that a lot of cities make a ton of money from tourists and visitors during July 4th, so for them, having huge events with fireworks and parades is a must. Dave: That's true, but I can't help but think we're losing sight of the true meaning of Independence Day. It's supposed to be a day to honor our nation's history and its founding principles. Instead, it's turned into a full-blown commercial event.

Swapping stories about our ancestors' contributions to this country and the spirited debates we've had today about our core values – that's what Independence Day is meant to be about. Brian: It's nice to see that we all wish to celebrate in our own way. Cheers to keeping the spirit of July 4th alive without losing our sanity in the chaos.

The first part of the book delves into why Iraq was chosen and all of the war planning that took place. The second part deals with the invasion itself, the battles and troop movements. The last part touches on the post regime collapse issues and the counterinsurgency that followed. One of the things about the book that I greatly appreciated was the maps. There were about 17 maps and one organizational chart in all at the front of the book which aided me greatly throughout the reading. For anyone who wants a comprehensive view of the lead up to and initial invasion, I would highly recommend reading this book, and then perhaps supplementing it with books like Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad and Ambush Alley: The Most Extraordinary Battle of the Iraq War to get an even deeper understanding on two of the battles that this book discusses Is this product review negative?

During Easter; Q: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Sure enough, she discovers the dead bodies of a money-grabbing nephew (Paolo Bernardi) and his wife (Francesco De Rose) lying preserved in open coffins in the wine cellar. Maria is gorily killed by the elderly Sarah in the greenhouse the next morning while announcing her plans to quit.Meanwhile, three hoodlums, Diana (Karina Huff), Tony (Keith Van Hoven) and Paul (Peter Hintz) are driving through the area and decide to rob the old couple's house after receiving a tip-off from a grocery store owner in a nearby town about the wealth it supposedly contains and the decrepitude of the owners. That evening, Diana cunningly talks her way into the household by pretending that her car has broken down nearby and asks to use the phone. Soon, the phone lines are cut by her male accomplices and they force entry through an open window. Their plans to rob the old couple go badly wrong when Peter intervenes with his shotgun. A bloodbath ensues with Sarah accidentally getting shot, Peter getting killed by Paul, and Victor attacks Tony, forcing Diana to shoot him dead. The young trio are horrified by this turn of events, but decide to bundle the bodies away in a cupboard.At first the dazed criminals fail to notice what effect the mayhem has had on all the clocks in the house. Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed. When they do notice, they try to leave, but are trapped indoors by the Dobermans let loose to prowl the grounds.

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers.

Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.

Please briefly summarize this news article: State dinner will start with a gussied-up version of Canada’s late-night party food The White House will pass out poutine – that late-night Canadian beer sponge of French fries, cheese curds and gravy — at the state dinner in honor of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife on Thursday night. One of the country’s most popular exports, the greasy rib-sticker with ties to Quebec (and really late nights) will be spiffed up and scaled back in the hands of White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford. Her more formal take on the fast food involves shavings of smoked duck and cheese curds finished with red wine gravy and served on delicate wafer fries: a one-bite canapé. [Local chef add new flavors to poutine, Canada’s comfort food] No sooner was the menu announced than the Twitterverse lit up with reactions from America’s neighbors to the north, notoriously skeptical of outside interpretations of such an iconic dish. “With real cheese curds or no? THIS IS IMPORTANT!” tweeted the Globe and Mail’s Ann Hui. Otherwise, the menu, relying on American ingredients from sea to shining sea, played it fairly straight. If one of the points of breaking bread with another country is to underscore shared values, this state dinner plans to do its duty. As Comerford put it at a preview Wednesday afternoon, “We share a lot of commonality in terms of ingredients. So it’s not a stretch for us to do something wonderful.” Spring is checked off in practically every bite listed for the first course, a “casserole” featuring baked Alaskan halibut, asparagus, chanterelles and herbed butter in individual tureens. The second course, a composed salad, sounds like a recipe borrowed from one of the trendy Washington restaurants that first lady Michelle Obama favors. The most fashion-forward of the courses, it will incorporate slivers of apricots roasted with ginger and cardamom and arranged with crystal lettuce, along with what a press release described as “young” arugula and “variegated” spinach. Garnishing the greens: pine nut crisps and shaved Appalachian cheese from Galax, Va. The main course is a work horse featuring baby lamb chops, creamy garlicky baked potatoes and a fricassee of spring vegetables. [Parsing the French state dinner menu: Choices reflect trends, standbys] One of the three wines poured for the evening, the 2013 Pence Ranch chardonnay, has a D.C. connection. Sashi Moorman, the winery’s consultant, worked in Washington with restaurateur Peter Pastan at Obelisk before going on to become one of the hottest winemakers in Santa Barbara County. For the dessert of maple pecan cake with butterscotch swirl ice cream, it will be New England, not Canadian, maple syrup; White House pastry chef Susan Morrison attributed the selection to “availability.” Indeed, one of the few shout-outs to Canada, beyond the poutine, is the mere splash of Canadian whisky on the lamb. Three pastry cooks spent a full week making the last impression, “A View from the Mountain Top”: 22 trays of sweet little bears, tiny trees, golf-ball-size snowballs, golden raisin tarts — French-Canadians know the latter as tarte à la farlouche — and more displayed against a postcard-size photograph of the Rocky Mountains. Together with the riff on poutine, the choice seems like a wink to an ally’s youth, vigor and interests.

I appreciate this very much. I will order again from this seller. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review initially starts off as negative, but ultimately shifts to a positive tone by the end of the review. At the beginning of the review, the customer states that they never received the product after placing their order and subsequently left a poor review. This clearly indicates a negative tone, as the customer encountered an unsatisfactory and frustrating experience. The mention of the previous negative review further emphasizes dissatisfaction with their initial transaction. However, the tone of the review changes as it progresses. The customer acknowledges the seller's prompt attention to their concern and expresses their appreciation when a second order was sent without delay. This demonstrates a shift to a positive tone, as the customer believes the seller took their complaint seriously and made an effort to rectify the situation to their satisfaction. The customer's sentiment turns positive as their issue was addressed efficiently and effectively. By the end of the review, the customer expresses their willingness to order again from the seller, further reinforcing the overall positive tone. Although their initial experience was less than desirable, the seller's attentive customer service ultimately wins over the disappointed buyer, resulting in a predominantly positive tone for the review. The customer's statement that they \\"will order again from this seller\\" can be seen as a recommendation, which is a clear indication that the customer has a favorable view of the seller despite the initial negative experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These approaches allow one to draw shapes and figures in innovative ways. One such technique is by drawing \\"outside the box\\". The approach explained below provides a step-by-step guide to recreate a diagram using this method. This article aims to explain the process and highlight the benefits of the \\"Outside the Box\\" method in drawing. Unraveling the \\"Outside the Box\\" Method: At its core, the \\"Outside the Box\\" method offers a more unconventional route to drawing. For those looking for an alternative approach, this technique will prove to be an interesting challenge. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the \\"Outside the Box\\" method: 1. Begin at the top right dot: As described, the starting point for this method is the top right dot within the box. This dot will be the foundation from which the entire diagram will be constructed.     2. Move the pen back to the center dot on the same line: Once the top right dot has been identified, the next step is to connect this dot to the center dot on the same line. This movement contributes to the formation of the first portion of the diagram. 3. Move the pen to the center dot and then left and right to make the third line, returning to the center dot: Next, position your pen at the center dot where the first line ended. From this point, draw a horizontal line extending towards the left and right end of the box, thereby creating a third line. Now, return the pen to the center dot for the next movement. 4. Extend the second line down to the middle dot on the bottom: Continuing from the center dot, draw a vertical line downwards, ending at the middle dot on the bottom of the box. This extension forms the second part of the diagram. 5. Move the pen left and right to complete the fourth line on the bottom: Lastly, from the middle bottom dot, draw a horizontal line extending towards the left and right ends of the box. This movement completes the final portion of the diagram. Benefits of the \\"Outside the Box\\" Method: The method's particular process of drawing highlights a sequence to follow when constructing diagrams. The \\"Outside the Box\\" technique offers several benefits, including: - Enhancing creativity through an unconventional method - Training the mind to view shapes and figures in a different light - Providing a sense of accomplishment from mastering a new technique Conclusion: The \\"Outside the Box\\" method is an inventive approach to drawing, providing a fresh perspective for individuals who appreciate the artistic process. By following the step-by-step guidelines discussed in this article, users can explore alternative ways of thinking about shapes and figures. Embracing this unconventional drawing technique could inspire a newfound appreciation for art and design and stimulate creativity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.

Article: Many years ago in a small German town, a Jewish businessman had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to the moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral  and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me!\\" she said. \\"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one. And since the moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into an... Question: What lesson can we learn from the story?

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years?

I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening. When I think of the films that are shown at festivals, I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. There's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making.

The writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. There is nothing typically independent about this film. As an aspiring director, I am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. This is one of those films. As I watched The Big Bad Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. When a movie makes me feel like that, I know it's really good. This is the first feature-length project from Ishai Setton and I found myself wishing that It had been my project. For me, that's really rare. See this film. It's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. Paget Brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance. She has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. That's a gift.

Summarize this article: This is a good starting number for beginning your own superworm colony. You can purchase live superworm larvae online or from a pet supply store in your area. If you purchase superworms online, check to make sure that the worms you are buying are shipped live. You can use plastic film canisters, partitioned craft boxes, condiment cups, or empty plastic cosmetic jars for this purpose. Poke or drill a small hole in the lid of each container so that your superworms can breathe.  It’s important to store your pupating superworms in their own containers so that adults and other larvae won’t nibble on them while they mature. Isolating the superworms in dark containers will also stimulate the pupation process, which could otherwise take up to 5 months to occur naturally. Wheat bran or oatmeal will work well for this purpose. Use just enough to cover the bottom of the container. The substrate will serve as both bedding and a source of nourishment for the superworm larvae.  There’s no need to put any additional food in the containers for the superworm larvae. Some breeders recommend against using substrate altogether, since any source of food can slow down the pupating process. If you choose to leave out the substrate, make sure the larvae are already full size (about 2 inches (51 mm) long) before isolating them. Once the superworms and substrate are in their containers, put the containers in a dark area, such as a drawer or cabinet. Make sure that the storage area is warm, preferably around 80 °F (27 °C). It is especially important to keep your superworms in a dark place if you are using transparent or translucent containers, such as glass jars or clear plastic condiment cups. Peek in on your superworm larvae occasionally over the next week to 10 days. After a few days, you should notice that most of your superworms have curled up into a “c” or “e” shape. By the end of a week or so, they should begin to transform into “alien”-looking pupae, with a shorter, cream-colored body and ridges that will eventually become legs. Any larvae that are stiff and straight or have turned dark in color are probably dead. Discard any dead larvae and replace them with live ones. Check the pupae occasionally to look for signs that they are maturing, such as darkening of the legs. It will take about 2 more weeks for the pupae to transform into beetles. Continue to store the pupae in separate containers until they mature. If you put the pupae together, the beetles that mature first might snack on the other pupae. Summary:","output":"To start your own superworm colony, purchase live superworm larvae online or from a pet supply store. Use containers like plastic film canisters or partitioned craft boxes with small air holes to house each superworm separately to prevent nibbling by other larvae. Isolating them in dark containers speeds up the pupation process. Use wheat bran or oatmeal as a substrate for bedding and nourishment, but do not add extra food. Place the containers in a warm, dark area and check on the larvae periodically. Over time, they will transform into pupae and eventually beetles. Discard dead larvae and continue to store the pupae separately until they fully mature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Such an atmosphere is valuable for parents who wish to relax while their children are entertained and engaged in a safe environment. Unfortunately, Fitzbillies' customer rating of 1 out of 5 raises some concerns. This low score may be an indication of various issues that the coffee shop needs to address. Some of the potential problems contributing to the rating could be related to the quality or taste of the food and drinks, the layout and cleanliness of the establishment, or the efficiency and friendliness of the staff.

Solve this instance: Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images, where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient, hard sample mining is usually employed, with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However, the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space, where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper, we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit, which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end.

Rambus Inc. shot up almost 33 percent , making it the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq .","output":"No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning due to a key difference in the specifics of the percentage increase being depicted. In the first sentence, it's stated that Rambus Inc., a company on the NASDAQ stock exchange (denoted by its ticker symbol RMBS), experienced an increase or 'shot up' in its stock value by 38 percent. This considerable increase labels it as the 'the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq', implying that out of all the various companies trading under the NASDAQ exchange, Rambus Inc. had the most significant boost in percentage on that particular day or time period. On the contrary, the second sentence illustrates that Rambus Inc.'s stock value surged by almost 33 percent. Despite the fact that this still makes it the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, the intensity of the rise in stock value isn't the same as the one depicted in the first sentence. While both sentences relate that Rambus Inc. was the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq, the specific percentage of the increase differs between the two sentences. The first sentence mentions a 38 percent increase while the second refers to a close to 33 percent. Even though both figures show a substantial rise signifying a positive market performance, the disparity between 38 percent and 33 percent is notable and thus the two sentences don't convey the same meaning.  Normally, an investor would be much more interested in a 38% gain than a 33% gain. The difference in those 5 percentage points could mean a significant increase in profits depending on the size of the initial investment.

Write a summary based on this article: 2. OkCupid works by asking people a series of questions about their personality then matching similar people with similar answers using an algorithm.      You are given a percentage match for each eligible partner. But the chances of being matched with someone who’s perfect for you (or whom you like) is quite slim.      Out of the thousands of personality questions you might get asked, what if there was a way to find out which questions mattered to the women he might be interested in and just answer those? ||||| Mathematician Chris McKinlay hacked OKCupid to find the girl of his dreams. Emily Shur      Chris McKinlay was folded into a cramped fifth-floor cubicle in UCLA’s math sciences building, lit by a single bulb and the glow from his monitor. It was 3 in the morn­ing, the optimal time to squeeze cycles out of the supercomputer in Colorado that he was using for his PhD dissertation. (The subject: large-scale data processing and parallel numerical methods.) While the computer chugged, he clicked open a second window to check his OkCupid inbox.      McKinlay, a lanky 35-year-old with tousled hair, was one of about 40 million Americans looking for romance through websites like Match.com, J-Date, and e-Harmony, and he’d been searching in vain since his last breakup nine months earlier. He’d sent dozens of cutesy introductory messages to women touted as potential matches by OkCupid’s algorithms. Most were ignored; he’d gone on a total of six first dates.      On that early morning in June 2012, his compiler crunching out machine code in one window, his forlorn dating profile sitting idle in the other, it dawned on him that he was doing it wrong. He’d been approaching online matchmaking like any other user. Instead, he realized, he should be dating like a mathematician.      OkCupid was founded by Harvard math majors in 2004, and it first caught daters’ attention because of its computational approach to matchmaking. Members answer droves of multiple-choice survey questions on everything from politics, religion, and family to love, sex, and smartphones.      On average, respondents select 350 questions from a pool of thousands—“Which of the following is most likely to draw you to a movie?” or “How important is religion/God in your life?” For each, the user records an answer, specifies which responses they’d find acceptable in a mate, and rates how important the question is to them on a five-point scale from “irrelevant” to “mandatory.” OkCupid’s matching engine uses that data to calculate a couple’s compatibility. The closer to 100 percent—mathematical soul mate—the better.      But mathematically, McKinlay’s compatibility with women in Los Angeles was abysmal. OkCupid’s algorithms use only the questions that both potential matches decide to answer, and the match questions McKinlay had chosen—more or less at random—had proven unpopular. When he scrolled through his matches, fewer than 100 women would appear above the 90 percent compatibility mark. And that was in a city containing some 2 million women (approximately 80,000 of them on OkCupid). On a site where compatibility equals visibility, he was practically a ghost.      He realized he’d have to boost that number. If, through statistical sampling, McKinlay could ascertain which questions mattered to the kind of women he liked, he could construct a new profile that honestly answered those questions and ignored the rest. He could match every woman in LA who might be right for him, and none that weren’t.      Chris McKinlay used Python scripts to riffle through hundreds of OkCupid survey questions. He then sorted female daters into seven clusters, like “Diverse” and “Mindful,” each with distinct characteristics. Maurico Alejo      Even for a mathematician, McKinlay is unusual. Raised in a Boston suburb, he graduated from Middlebury College in 2001 with a degree in Chinese. In August of that year he took a part-time job in New York translating Chinese into English for a company on the 91st floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center. The towers fell five weeks later. (McKinlay wasn’t due at the office until 2 o’clock that day. He was asleep when the first plane hit the north tower at 8:46 am.) “After that I asked myself what I really wanted to be doing,” he says. A friend at Columbia recruited him into an offshoot of MIT’s famed professional blackjack team, and he spent the next few years bouncing between New York and Las Vegas, counting cards and earning up to 60,000 a year.      The experience kindled his interest in applied math, ultimately inspiring him to earn a master’s and then a PhD in the field. “They were capable of using mathema­tics in lots of different situations,” he says. “They could see some new game—like Three Card Pai Gow Poker—then go home, write some code, and come up with a strategy to beat it.”      Now he’d do the same for love. First he’d need data. While his dissertation work continued to run on the side, he set up 12 fake OkCupid accounts and wrote a Python script to manage them. The script would search his target demographic (heterosexual and bisexual women between the ages of 25 and 45), visit their pages, and scrape their profiles for every scrap of available information: ethnicity, height, smoker or nonsmoker, astrological sign—“all that crap,” he says.      To find the survey answers, he had to do a bit of extra sleuthing. OkCupid lets users see the responses of others, but only to questions they’ve answered themselves. McKinlay set up his bots to simply answer each question randomly—he wasn’t using the dummy profiles to attract any of the women, so the answers didn’t mat­ter—then scooped the women’s answers into a database.      McKinlay watched with satisfaction as his bots purred along. Then, after about a thousand profiles were collected, he hit his first roadblock. OkCupid has a system in place to prevent exactly this kind of data harvesting: It can spot rapid-fire use easily. One by one, his bots started getting banned.      He would have to train them to act human.      He turned to his friend Sam Torrisi, a neuroscientist who’d recently taught McKinlay music theory in exchange for advanced math lessons. Torrisi was also on OkCupid, and he agreed to install spyware on his computer to monitor his use of the site. With the data in hand, McKinlay programmed his bots to simulate Torrisi’s click-rates and typing speed. He brought in a second computer from home and plugged it into the math department’s broadband line so it could run uninterrupted 24 hours a day.      After three weeks he’d harvested 6 million questions and answers from 20,000 women all over the country. McKinlay’s dissertation was relegated to a side project as he dove into the data. He was already sleeping in his cubicle most nights. Now he gave up his apartment entirely and moved into the dingy beige cell, laying a thin mattress across his desk when it was time to sleep.      For McKinlay’s plan to work, he’d have to find a pattern in the survey data—a way to roughly group the women according to their similarities. The breakthrough came when he coded up a modified Bell Labs algorithm called K-Modes. First used in 1998 to analyze diseased soybean crops, it takes categorical data and clumps it like the colored wax swimming in a Lava Lamp. With some fine-tuning he could adjust the viscosity of the results, thinning it into a slick or coagulating it into a single, solid glob.      He played with the dial and found a natural resting point where the 20,000 women clumped into seven statistically distinct clusters based on their questions and answers. “I was ecstatic,” he says. “That was the high point of June.”      He retasked his bots to gather another sample: 5,000 women in Los Angeles and San Francisco who’d logged on to OkCupid in the past month. Another pass through K-Modes confirmed that they clustered in a similar way. His statistical sampling had worked.      Now he just had to decide which cluster best suited him. He checked out some profiles from each. One cluster was too young, two were too old, another was too Christian. But he lingered over a cluster dominated by women in their mid-twenties who looked like indie types, musicians and artists. This was the golden cluster. The haystack in which he’d find his needle. Somewhere within, he’d find true love.      Actually, a neighboring cluster looked pretty cool too—slightly older women who held professional creative jobs, like editors and designers. He decided to go for both. He’d set up two profiles and optimize one for the A group and one for the B group.      He text-mined the two clusters to learn what interested them; teaching turned out to be a popular topic, so he wrote a bio that emphasized his work as a math professor. The important part, though, would be the survey. He picked out the 500 questions that were most popular with both clusters. He’d already decided he would fill out his answers honestly—he didn’t want to build his future relationship on a foundation of computer-generated lies. But he’d let his computer figure out how much importance to assign each question, using a machine-learning algorithm called adaptive boosting to derive the best weightings. ||||| Summary:","output":"Mathematician Chris McKinlay hacked OkCupid to find his ideal partner by using algorithms to analyze data gathered from the dating site's multiple-choice survey questions.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of\\" is \\"allow growth\\", given that  some viruses have an envelope of fats and proteins? A:","output":"In light of the provided information, stating that some viruses have an envelope comprised of fats and proteins, the answer \\"allow growth\\" would not be the correct response to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of.\\" The most accurate answer, as you mentioned, would be that some viruses have an envelope made up of fats (lipids) and proteins. To understand why this is the appropriate response, we must first delve into the basic structure of viruses and the role of the envelope in their life cycle. A virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of living host organisms. Viruses are composed of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, encased in a protein coat known as a capsid. Some viruses possess an additional layer surrounding the capsid, referred to as an envelope. The viral envelope is derived from the host cell's membrane during the process of viral replication, and therefore, it integrates lipids (fats) and proteins from the host. The presence of an envelope in a virus is not related to promoting growth, as viruses do not grow or reproduce in the same way as living organisms. Instead, the envelope serves a variety of functions that facilitate the infection process in viruses: 1. Host cell recognition: The envelope proteins often serve as viral attachment glycoproteins, which are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific receptors on the surface of a host cell. This interaction enables the virus to enter the cell and initiate the infection. 2. Virus entry: Some enveloped viruses can enter the host cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. This process delivers the viral genome into the cell, making it available for replication. 3. Evasion of host immune response: The envelope, being acquired from the host cell membrane, may help the virus remain undetected by the host's immune system, as it can resemble self-molecules and evade the immune defenses. 4. Release of progeny viruses: Upon viral replication within a host cell, the newly formed viral particles require release from the cell to infect other cells or hosts. The envelope assists in this process by budding off the host cell membrane, which in turn allows the virus to exit without causing immediate cell lysis (rupture of the cell). In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"some viruses have an envelope of\\" is not \\"allow growth\\" but rather \\"fats and proteins.\\" The viral envelope, made up of lipids and proteins derived from the host cell, aids in host cell recognition, virus entry, immune evasion, and release of new viral particles, rather than promoting growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","output":"Based on the information provided, it appears that the system has a 425W power supply and operates at 90 percent efficiency. However, it seems like this configuration is not compatible with DDR3 RDIMM memory. In order to further elaborate on this issue, it's important to dive deeper and examine the compatibility of the various components and potential solutions to this problem. To begin with, let's get a better understanding of each component mentioned: 1. 425W Power Supply: A 425-Watt power supply is designed to provide adequate power to all the components within a computer system. The wattage requirement of a system is primarily determined by the processor, graphics cards, and other hardware components that may require a significant amount of power. 2. 90 percent efficiency: This refers to the efficiency of the power supply unit (PSU) in terms of converting the AC power from the wall socket to usable DC power for the components. A higher efficiency PSU results in less wasted energy as heat and reduces the overall power consumption of your system. 3. DDR3 RDIMM Memory: DDR3 is a type of memory technology used for Random Access Memory (RAM) modules. RDIMM, or Registered DIMM, is a more advanced form of DDR3 memory that includes a hardware register between the DRAM modules and the memory controller. It is typically used in servers and workstations where stability and reliability are crucial, as the additional register helps detect and correct errors. Now, let's address potential compatibility issues: The main compatibility concern here is the use of DDR3 RDIMM memory with the specified power supply and efficiency. In general, the incompatibility of a specific component would not be directly related to the power supply and its efficiency. DDR3 RDIMM memory modules, being primarily designed for servers and workstations, might not be compatible with a regular desktop motherboard. It's important to verify the compatibility of your motherboard with RDIMM memory and ensure it supports this type of memory. Instead, you might need to use a non-registered DDR3 memory, like UDIMM (Unbuffered DIMM), which is more common in consumer-grade systems. Another factor to consider is the overall power consumption of the components, including the DDR3 RDIMM memory modules. While it's unlikely that the memory modules would significantly impact the power requirements, it's good practice to calculate the total power consumption of your system and make sure the 425W power supply is sufficient to cater to all the components. In conclusion, the compatibility issue in this scenario is likely due to the use of DDR3 RDIMM memory with a desktop motherboard that may not support it. To resolve this problem, verify your motherboard's compatibility with RDIMM memory or opt for a UDIMM memory module instead. Additionally, ensure that the power supply is adequate to cater to all the components in your system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off. If I need to be out for a day or two, Dr. Edwards can fill in for me.\\" \\"Yeah, or if you need to take off a week for a trip to Hawaii with your beautiful new wife.\\" Carsie gave him a sexy smile. \\"That's right.

Article: Scientists are making new studies of color and its effects on our health. They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies. Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again. Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. Question: After reading the passage we can conclude that   _  . Options: A: blind people can be affected by colors, too B: one's heart will beat fast in a colorful room than in a white room C: the chemicals in the brain change with feelings and emotions D: if one's blood pressure drops, his breathing will get slower and slower The answer is:","output":"A: blind people can be affected by colors, too"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"No, the answer \\"voltage\\" is not correct in the context of the question \\"what makes temperature vary?\\" when referring to seasonal temperature variations. Instead, temperature variations are primarily due to the Earth's axial tilt, the angle of sunlight, and the resulting distribution of solar energy. Earth's axial tilt, at approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the planet to experience different amounts of sunlight in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres depending on the time of year. During the summer months, the Earth's tilt causes the sun's rays to strike the Earth's surface more directly, resulting in higher temperatures. Conversely, in the winter, the tilt causes sunlight to strike the Earth at a sharper angle, which results in less solar energy being absorbed by the surface and leads to lower temperatures. Additionally, other factors that influence temperature variations include geographical location, elevation, ocean currents, and local weather patterns. In the field of electronics, voltage can create heat through the resistance of components, which can cause temperature variations. However, this is not relevant to the seasonal temperature changes experienced on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (bóshì 博士) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe.

Question: What is the original name of the person whose early work was published primarily in magazines?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by a £34.5million  global fraud scam, a court heard today. ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport, 46, hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion, and boasted of befriending A list celebrities and royalty including supermodel Kate Moss, and Princes William and Harry. But Fast Eddie, as he was known to his friends, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped 51 victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes. 'Fast Eddie': Edward Davenport pictured with his Thai girlfriend Monthira Sanan-Ua. A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by global fraud made £34.5million from the scam. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport’s scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence. Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as India, Canada and Dubai. Davenport, who was sentenced to seven and a half years behind bars, was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the beginning of a three week confiscation hearing. Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said Davenport is thought to have made £34.5m gained through his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit from his enterprises during the six year con, between 2003 and 2009. But Davenport will argue he should only pay back £8m of his criminal proceeds. ‘The prosecution figure of over £34m arises from the application of three statutory assumptions in the proceeds of crime act’, said Mr Mayo. ‘The figure under the first assumption of £17.5m is made up principally of money transferred into bank accounts during that six year period. ‘We assume any of the property held by the defendant at any time after the date of conviction, May 19, 2011, was obtained by him as a result of general criminal conduct. ‘That amounts to £12.5m.’ He said the total amount Davenport is thought to have made is comprised of inflation in the value of money, and profit from other property deals. Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco. He lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. Central to the confiscation hearing will be the mansion, at 33 Portland Place, which he bought for £3.9m from the Sierra Leone government. The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Mr Mayo said the prosecution believe the mansion, valued at £10m, was obtained through fraud, whereas Davenport’s legal team will argue it was bought legally. 'Thirty Three Portland Place is a substantial property in central London, the freehold reversion of the premises was bought by Edward Davenport on October 31, 2005, for a total purchase price of £3,937,000’, he said. ‘Has Edward Davenport succeeded in convincing that it was not correct to make the statutory assumption that 33 Portland Place represents proceeds of general criminal conduct? ‘Has Edward Davenport shown there would be a serious risk of injustice if that assumption were made?’ Mr Mayo added both defence and prosecution agree Davenport currently has £14m of assets which are available for confiscation. The conman’s defence team argue he should repay £8m, and assert that the London mansion should not be part of proceedings. They will argue £6m should be seized from his Swiss and Monaco bank accounts, just £0.8m in property assets, and £97,000 from a separate property deal. Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in 1999 for £3.9m while the country was embroiled in civil war. Davenport’s web page boasted: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’ It suggested that Davenport was a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’ Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova, Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne. One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000 in up-front fees. She told his trial: ‘He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny. ‘It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common conman. He fully deserves his sentence.’ He turned out in Savile Row suits for his trial, but is now undergoing dialysis treatment three times a week when the court will not sit.

According to the IAU, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that: 1. Orbits the Sun. 2. Has sufficient mass to assume a round or nearly round shape due to its own gravity. 3. Has not cleared its orbit of other debris. 4. Is not a satellite (moon) of another celestial body. Here is a brief description of the five recognized dwarf planets: 1. Pluto: Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially classified as the ninth planet. However, in 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for planets, which led to Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet. It is located in the Kuiper Belt, an area beyond Neptune's orbit that is home to numerous small celestial bodies. Pluto takes approximately 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun and has a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles). 2. Eris: Discovered in 2005, Eris is the largest known dwarf planet with a diameter of approximately 2,326 kilometers (1,445 miles). Its discovery led to the debate that resulted in the IAU's new definition of a planet and the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. Eris is located in a region of space called the scattered disk, beyond the Kuiper Belt. It has an extremely elliptical orbit that takes about 558 Earth years to complete. 3. Haumea: Discovered in 2004, Haumea is an elongated, egg-shaped dwarf planet with dimensions of about 1,960 x 1,518 x 996 kilometers (1,218 x 944 x 619 miles). It is located in the Kuiper Belt and takes around 284 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Haumea has two known moons, Hi'iaka and Namaka, and has a unique fast rotation, completing one spin in just under four Earth hours. 4. Makemake: Discovered in 2005, Makemake is another Kuiper Belt resident with an approximate diameter of 1,430 kilometers (889 miles). It has one known moon, named S/2015 (136472) 1 or MK2, and it takes about 310 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun. 5. Ceres: Discovered in 1801, Ceres was initially classified as a planet but was later reclassified as an asteroid. It is the largest object in the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was eventually reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the IAU established the new criteria. It has a diameter of about 590 miles (940 kilometers) and takes approximately 4.6 Earth years to orbit the Sun. In addition to these recognized dwarf planets, there are numerous other celestial bodies that might be classified as dwarf planets in the future. It is estimated that there could be hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of potential dwarf planets residing in various regions of our solar system, waiting to be discovered and classified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I checked the envelopes, putting aside the ones addressed to my husband. It had been over three years since Bob had died. To friends and family it looked like I had moved past the worst of my sorrow. I took care of my house, socialized and kept up with community. On the outside everything appeared to be normal. But inside I was anything but I worried I would never get better, never be myself again. They say sorrow has no set time limit, but I was so tired of feeling empty and hopeless. My sorrow was sharp and fresh as ever. It was like a wall of pressure in my chest, pressing my heart. I picked up a piece of Bob's mail and held it out to tear in half, but stopped myself from cutting up the envelope. The letter was from an organization that funded a Haitian orphanage called _ .

The number of rings in a tree trunk can be used to estimate the age of the tree, and age of Pine trees (AGE) in years. Given these facts, what unit of time can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk among the following options: - hours  - decades  - months  - H20  - Joules  - DNA  - years  - seasons Answer:","output":"The unit of time that can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk to determine the age of a tree, particularly Pine trees, is years. Each ring in the tree trunk represents a full year of the tree's growth. This annual growth cycle is marked by a noticeable change in the wood's appearance, forming a ring. Delving deeper, a tree adds a new layer of growth to its trunk every year. These new layers can be observed as annual growth rings. In temperate regions, trees typically undergo two growth periods in a year. The initial growth period occurs in spring, when the tree's growth is fastest and the wood is lighter in color. During this period, the cells are larger and less dense, forming the earlywood or springwood. In summer, the growth rate slows down and the wood formed is darker and more dense, which is known as latewood or summerwood. The transition from one growth period to another results in the formation of annual rings. Upon taking a cross-section of the tree trunk, these annual rings are visible and can be counted to estimate the tree's age. This method of determining the tree's age is called dendrochronology. One annual ring typically represents one year of growth in the life of the tree. So, by counting the total number of rings present in the trunk, we can estimate the tree's age in years. Hence, among all the given units of time - hours, decades, months, H20, Joules, DNA, years, and seasons - the most accurate unit for estimating the age of a tree using the rings in its trunk is years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is the correct answer because it is consistent with the context of the passage, which discusses the avoidance of airspace in eastern Ukraine due to safety concerns. Eurocontrol, as an intergovernmental organization overseeing air traffic management in Europe, would have the authority to direct its member states, including Ukraine, to close specific flight routes due to safety concerns. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - CNN is a news organization and does not have the authority to close flight routes. - Dnepropetrovsk is a region within Ukraine and does not have independent authority to close flight routes. - Eurocontrol is mentioned as the organization \\"warning against\\" flying in these areas, but it should be the subject of a corresponding coordinating authority in Asia that is closing routes in response to the situation. - Europe is a continent and does not have the authority to close flight routes. - European Aviation Safety Agency is mentioned in the passage as issuing a warning, but not as the authority closing flight routes. - FAA and Federal Aviation Administration are American agencies and do not have jurisdiction over airspace in Ukraine. - Malaysia Airlines Flight is a flight that crashed, not an authority to close flight routes. - Russian authorities do not have jurisdiction over Ukrainian airspace. - Simferopol Flight Information Regions is a region within Ukraine and does not have independent authority to close flight routes. - U.S. authorities do not have jurisdiction over Ukrainian airspace. - Ukraine authorities could close routes in eastern Ukraine, but the passage states that Eurocontrol provided the warning, and the coordinating authority in Asia should be the one closing the routes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during hunting happens, how will it affect more.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of hunting during a forest fire has both direct and indirect effects on the already existing process mentioned. The process described includes the destruction of habitat, change in predator-prey dynamics, bird migration, and changes in water temperature affecting aquatic life. Let's analyze the effects of hunting during this scenario: 1. Direct Effect on Habitat Destruction:    While the forest fire is responsible for destroying the habitat, adding hunting in this process accelerates habitat destruction. For instance, if hunters use off-road vehicles or create makeshift paths to access deeper forest areas, it might result in the destruction of the unburned areas. 2. Direct Effect on Predator-Prey Dynamics:    Hunting during this time may further impact the predator-prey dynamics. Hunters may target specific species, which can affect existing food chain within the forest. If hunters target predators, the preys might experience an initial population spike, followed by shortage of food and habitat. On the other hand, if hunters focus on prey species, the predators will have even more trouble finding their food, which may lead to decreased predator population in the long run. 3. Indirect Effect on Bird Migration:    The hunting activities may exacerbate bird displacement caused by the forest fire. The noise and disturbance created by hunters may force the birds to fly further away or alter their original migration patterns. This can create a domino effect on the ecosystems in areas where the birds eventually end up. Additionally, if hunters target birds during this turmoil, bird populations may face a decline more severe than just from the forest fire. 4. Indirect Effect on Water Temperature and Aquatic Life:    Although hunting itself may not directly affect water temperature, its indirect consequences on aquatic life could be significant. The increased human activity near water sources might cause an alteration in water quality due to increased waste or debris. Moreover, if hunters target fish or other aquatic organisms, it can disrupt the balance of aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, the perturbation of hunting during a forest fire has both direct and indirect effects on the existing process of habitat destruction, predator-prey dynamics, bird migration, and aquatic life. Introducing hunting during a forest fire increases the detrimental effects on the ecosystem and can further harm the already vulnerable wildlife populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides.

Background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.  Paragraph: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Ice Ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases.

As food is pushed along, it undergoes digestion. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work!  Question: \\"What is mechanical digestion?\\" Answer: \\"Occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks, done by chewing\\" Is this answer correct? Select from: [+] no; [+] yes;...I think the answer is","output":"[+] yes; The answer is correct because mechanical digestion is the process of physically breaking down food into smaller pieces. This happens when you chew your food with your teeth, and also in your stomach when the muscles contract to mix and break down food. This is different from chemical digestion, which involves breaking down food with enzymes and other chemicals into nutrients that can be absorbed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: What causes fear in skating? Options: - injuries - increased heart rate - might fall - can't stop - move fast  Explain why a human would choose \\"might fall\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human might choose \\"might fall\\" as the answer to the question \\"What causes fear in skating?\\" because it is a common and relatable concern for many people.  Step 1: Analyzing the options. First, let's look at the available options: - injuries: a valid concern, but not the direct cause of fear. It's more of a consequence of falling. - increased heart rate: a physiological response to fear or exercise, not the cause of fear itself. - might fall: the possibility of losing balance and experiencing a fall while skating. - can't stop: closely related to losing control, but not necessarily the primary reason for fear. - move fast: speed may be thrilling for some and intimidating for others, but it isn't the main cause of fear for most skaters. Step 2: Identifying the primary cause of fear. When learning or engaging in a new activity such as skating, the most common fear among people is the potential for falling. Falling can lead to embarrassment or physical injury, which in turn could impact one's confidence and willingness to continue learning or participating in the activity. Step 3: Understanding the human perspective. From a human perspective, this fear may stem from the lack of experience or confidence in one's own balance and skill. The innate drive for self-preservation also plays a role in this, as people instinctively avoid situations that have a potential for harm. Step 4: Justifying the choice. With these considerations in mind, \\"might fall\\" is an understandable and relatable answer to why fear arises in skating. It directly addresses the primary concern of maintaining balance and preventing a potentially painful or embarrassing situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information:  - North Wales is the northernmost unofficial region of Wales. Retail, transport and educational infrastructure are centred on Wrexham, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Bangor. It is bordered to the south by the counties of Ceredigion and Powys in Mid Wales, and to the east by the counties of Shropshire in the West Midlands and Cheshire in North West England.  - Gwynedd is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd. As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated. A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking. The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey. Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent. The current area is 2,548 square km (983.78 sq miles, slightly smaller than Luxembourg) with a population as measured in the 2011 Census of 121,874.  - Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (c. AD 56  c. AD 120) was a senator and an historian of the Roman Empire. The surviving portions of his two major worksthe \\"Annals\\" and the \\"Histories\\"examine the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in AD 14, to the years of the First JewishRoman War, in AD 70. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the \\"Annals\\" that is four books long.  - In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.  - Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex in Gwynedd , Wales . The fort was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78 , and was abandoned around AD 140 . A millennium later , in the Norman period , the site was reoccupied and refortified with a motte within the old walls . It is a scheduled monument in the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority .  - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.  - Gwynedd Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire, Wales.  - Gnaeus Julius Agricola (13 June 40  23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \\"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.  - The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain. Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.  - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.

Mars selects Larry's action figures, the Commando Elite, for the project and Irwin's educational toys, the Gorgonites, for their enemies, with the toyline expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Benson forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's overly powerful X1000 microprocessor to control the toys. Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with EMP shielding. Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer; unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are just toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro (Clint Walker), whom he mortally wounds. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the shop. At home, Alan learns the primary goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their homeland Gorgon, which they mistakenly... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Small Soldiers,\\" the Heartland Toy Company is acquired by top defense contractor GloboTech Industries. The acquisition is led by Globotech CEO Gil Mars, portrayed by Denis Leary. This acquisition sets the stage for the main plot of the movie, as Mars directs Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) to develop live-action toys that can \\"play back\\" – an idea that leads to the creation of the Commando Elite and Gorgonites toy lines. The movie follows teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) who inadvertently becomes involved in the conflict between the Commando Elite and the Gorgonites when he signs off on a shipment of the toys for his family's toy store without his father's knowledge. He later discovers that the toys are sentient due to the inclusion of an advanced X1000 microprocessor, which was originally designed for smart munitions guidance and learning capabilities. The Commando Elite, unlike the Gorgonites, do not understand that they are mere toys, leading to a series of dangerous misunderstandings and confrontations. Throughout the film, the audience watches as the conflict between the toys escalates, the Commando Elite become increasingly violent, and Alan works with the Gorgonites to protect his family and neighborhood. The movie ultimately concludes when Alan and his friends manage to defeat the Commando Elite with the help of an EMP (electromagnetic pulse), which disables the toys and their advanced microprocessors. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is important to weigh several factors. These include the unique concept of the movie, the talent attached to the project such as the cast and crew, and the potential audience appeal. \\"Small Soldiers\\" offers an interesting blend of action, adventure, comedy, and family themes, which could potentially draw a wide range of viewers. Furthermore, the film already boasts a strong cast with well-known actors, including Denis Leary, Jay Mohr, David Cross, Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Frank Langella, and Tommy Lee Jones. This, combined with the engaging storyline and unique concept, may make it a worthwhile investment. However, it is essential to evaluate the financial implications and thoroughly analyze the expected return on investment and associated risks before making a decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

Question: \\"What does the fact that the heartwood tree can survive decay tell us?\\"  Context: \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The fact that the heartwood tree can survive decay tells us several things about the tree's anatomy, growth, and adaptation mechanisms: 1. Heartwood is not vital for the tree's survival: As mentioned in the context, the term \\"heartwood\\" comes from its position in the tree, rather than its importance to the tree's life processes. Even when the heartwood is completely decayed, the tree can still thrive, suggesting that the living tissues essential for tree growth and maintenance are located elsewhere. 2. Sapwood plays a crucial role in the tree's life processes: The layer of live sapwood is responsible for transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree. It supports the functions necessary for the tree's growth and overall health. The varying thickness of sapwood among different species indicates that the concentration of living tissues may differ according to the tree's needs and adaptation strategies. 3. Tree species exhibit a range of heartwood formation patterns: Some species form heartwood early in their life, resulting in a thin layer of live sapwood. In other species, heartwood formation occurs more slowly or may not happen at all. This demonstrates the diverse growth strategies and adaptations among tree species to accommodate their specific environmental conditions and survival requirements. 4. Decay resistance varies across species: The ability of a tree to survive heartwood decay may also highlight the natural decay resistance mechanisms present in certain species. Trees with decayed heartwood but healthy sapwood may have evolved specific strategies or possess certain chemical compounds that help them combat decay and continue to thrive. In conclusion, the survival of a tree with decayed heartwood provides insights into the tree's anatomy, emphasizing the importance of sapwood for the tree's life processes, as well as the diverse growth patterns and adaptation strategies present in different tree species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is caught by the other girls, and forced to explain that the man offered her Â£20,000 for the ring. Annabelle, the new head girl of St. Trinian's, bartered for Â£100,000 from the man when he called back, but he refused and then proceeded to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable. She tells them a story about Pirate Fritton, her ancestor, who supposedly hid a great treasure somewhere in the world. He had two rings made, which when fitted together would reveal the location of the treasure. The man on the telephone who wanted the ring is Sir Piers Pomfrey, a member of a secret society, and descendant of a man robbed by Pirate Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers manages to steal the ring from headmistress Camilla.

As society and technology have evolved, so have the ways in which these specials have been presented. One of the most significant moments in the history of Christmas specials was when they were broadcast in color for the first time. In this article, we delve into the groundbreaking moment when Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz starred in the first ever color Christmas special, as well as the lasting impact it had on television history. The Show in Focus: A Colorful Classic The Christmas special in question was shown in color for the very first time, marking a new era in television history. This groundbreaking show starred the ever-popular Lucille Ball and her real-life husband Desi Arnaz. As pioneers of the sitcom genre, Ball and Arnaz joined forces yet again to create a one-of-a-kind holiday special that would capture the hearts of millions. Step 1: Transition to color The decision to broadcast the Christmas special in color was revolutionary at the time. Most television programming was still shown in black and white, and color televisions were not yet commonly owned. Despite this, the network believed in the power of color to add vibrancy to the performances and transform the viewing experience. The successful venture ignited a shift towards color programming in the television industry, as other networks followed suit. Step 2: Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as the leads Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as the stars of the special was a masterstroke. The couple had already captivated audiences across America with their incredibly popular show, I Love Lucy. Combining their on-screen chemistry with the dazzling visuals of a color broadcast, the Christmas special became an instant classic and a must-watch event. Step 3: Observing the Competition While the color Christmas special was a game changer, the ratings war was not without stiff competition. Airing the same year as the color special was the now-iconic A Charlie Brown Christmas. This classic animated film garnered 6.4 million viewers and quickly became a holiday institution in its own right. Despite the astounding success of A Charlie Brown Christmas, the color special starring Ball and Arnaz remained the ratings runner-up, illustrating just how monumental this event was in television history. Conclusion The introduction of color to television Christmas specials was a momentous occasion, paving the way for countless other productions to follow. The incredible performances of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in the first-ever color Christmas special remain etched in the minds of millions of viewers, serving as a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in the entertainment industry. This historic moment will forever be remembered as a turning point in television history, as it boldly brought the magic of vivid color to families across the globe during the most beloved time of the year."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Recorded originally by Willie Mae \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton on August 13, 1952, in Los Angeles and released by Peacock Records in late February 1953, \\"Hound Dog\\" was Thornton's only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\".  In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored.  When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\"  Philip H. Ennis sees \\"Two Hound Dogs\\", which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley & His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton's recording.

You are given a new situation: Dan is conducting a research to see how a substance behaves in varying pressure. First, he selects a gaseous substance in very low pressure. He calls it as case A. Then he increases the pressure. He calls it case B. Finally, he increases the pressure even further. He calls it case C.  and a hint : Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.  Please answer this question : Which case would most likely see the substance turning into liquid, case B or case C? A:","output":"Case B would most likely see the substance turning into a liquid. In Case A, the substance is in the gaseous state due to the very low pressure. As the pressure increases to Case B, the particles in the substance are forced closer together, and attractive forces between the particles cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. If the pressure is increased further to Case C, the substance might solidify, as putting a liquid under great pressure usually causes it to turn into a solid. Hence, Case B represents the most probable scenario in which the substance turns into a liquid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They started off poorly again, being held scoreless in the first half. Donovan McNabb tossed three interceptions in the first three quarters, with two of them being returned for touchdowns by Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber. Trailing 17-0, McNabb found fullback Thomas Tapeh in the end zone. A short touchdown pass to Reggie Brown brought the Eagles to within three. The Bucs added a field goal, making it 20-14.

Olivia Dunham is a fictional character and the main protagonist from the science fiction television series Fringe, which aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States from 2008 to 2013. The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Anna Torv. Olivia is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as an FBI Special Agent, working for a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. Having grown up with an abusive stepfather, Olivia struggles with the unexpected changes in her life, following her encounter with mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop, and his son and an eventual love interest for her, Peter Bishop. The character of Olivia has been described as \\"an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel[ed] back over time.\\" She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career \\"pretty much since [she] was nine\\", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.  In the reset timeline for the series' fourth season, Torv explained that \\"The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and had all this time to get used to it and work out that this is her life,\\" rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, \\"when Lincoln comes in, she's a little more open to him [than she was with Peter] and working with someone again.\\"  Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister Rachel, and Rachel's daughter Ella. Olivia was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott, and his supposed betrayal and death was something she dealt with for much of the first season. In the second season finale, Olivia and Peter Bishop finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss. Fauxlivia was involved in a serious relationship with Frank Stanton and eventually became engaged, but the two broke up when he discovered she was pregnant by Peter. Olivia was in a relationship with Peter after they mended things in episode 6B But shortly after that Peter built a bridge wiping himself from existence, causing Olivia to forget who he was. But through the cortexiphan and the power of their love, she soon remembered her life with him. They were married and have a daughter. In episodes 4.19 Letters of Transit and 5.1 Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11, their daughter finds them and reunites them.

Makeup will be no help when your eye is still swollen, and the application might even aggravate your eye further and delay healing time. Just be patient and give your injury a few days to heal. If you have cuts or lacerations around your eye, don't risk infection by trying to cover it with makeup. You'll just have to own your black eye until it heals. A primer will keep your makeup on longer and keep it from settling into wrinkles and creases around your eye. Apply the primer wherever there is discoloration and you plan to use makeup. Dab it on gently with your ring finger, which is your weakest finger and is least likely to irritate your sink. Depending on the stage of healing, your eye could be red, black, purple, brown, green, or yellow. This shade will show through your concealer and ruin the illusion, so you need to neutralize it by applying applying the opposite color, or the color that is across the color wheel. A color correcting concealer can do this while also applying concealer, or you can improvise with blush or eyeshadow.  If your bruise is green, use red, and vice versa. If your bruise is blue, use orange or salmon. If your bruise is yellow, try purple, and vice versa. Use your ring finger to gently pat the concealer around your eye, covering the color-corrected areas and also blending a little bit out beyond. Allow the concealer to dry and apply another layer if necessary.  Once the concealer is dry, apply your foundation and other makeup as normal, being careful to blend the edges of your concealer with the foundation. If you didn't use primer, you can use a dusting of translucent powder to set the concealer. Eyeliner or mascara should be avoided until your eye is healed, as it draws attention to the area.

Professional climber Will Gadd and his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and he may be one of the last to ever scale the crumbling ice wall. Some scientists are predicting that the ice will disappear completely by 2020 due to climate change. Scroll down for video. Professional climber Will Gadd and three other members of his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro. Mr Gadd may be one of the last to ever scale the receding ice wall as some experts believe the ice will completely disappear by 2020. After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will Gadd said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind' Mr Gadd said he felt lucky to complete the climb as the receding glaciers 'are just small remnants truly in their last grasp' After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind. ‘The glaciers are just small remnants truly in their last gasp. I felt very lucky to be there.’ The team – consisting of Will, climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana – had to cope with extreme challenges that put their bodies under incredible stress. Everyone on the team had to battle altitude sickness and sleepless nights. Will Gadd scaled the ice wall with climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana. The team had to cope with extreme challenges, including altitude sickness and sleepless nights, while scaling Africa's highest mountain. By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, Will became one of the first people in the modern era to scale the receding ice. Will said: ‘You'd just fall asleep and then wake up gasping for breath. ‘We didn't have weeks and weeks to acclimate to the altitude, it's too expensive to stay on the mountain, so we definitely pushed ourselves physically. Fortunately it all worked out OK.’ By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, each up to 200ft high, Will became one of the first people in the modern era – and possibly last – to scale the receding ice. Will Gadd said it was the 'wildest ice' he has encountered with ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand and overhanging prows. Will Gadd said the team pushed themselves physically because they didn't spend enough time acclimatising to the altitude. Will Gadd said the ice was 'literally disappearing in front of my eyes' as he scaled a frozen wall near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. Will added: ‘It was the wildest ice I've ever seen. ‘Ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand at 19,000 feet, overhanging prows that creaked while I climbed them, and so many wild possibilities blasted into crazy shapes by the high-altitude tropical sun. ‘The ice I climbed was literally disappearing in front of my eyes. None of what I climbed will survive another month. ‘Unfortunately, due to climate change, there won't be any ice on Kilimanjaro in the near future. ‘Kilimanjaro used to have ice over the entire summit plateau, but now there are only a few small glaciers remaining, and they are disappearing very fast.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Plan the path for your wires before starting any work. First look at the plan of your house and identify the rooms that require a cable hookup. Generally any rooms that will have a TV, landline phone, or computer need one.  Some contractors like to run wires into every room, just in case. That way, if you decide you want a cable hookup in another room later on, you don’t have to run new wires. If you only use wifi for your internet access, then you won’t need ethernet cables in every room with a computer. The wiring panel is where all your home’s network wires connect and where service providers attach their wires to. For the best location, look for a point in your home that is out of the way and where you can easily run wires to. Contractors usually prefer to put these boxes in the basement if you have one, because it’s easy to run the wires up through the walls and to other rooms. Another popular choice is a laundry room.  Wiring panels can also be unsightly, so consider locating it in a closet or a room that visitors don’t enter. Wiring panels are also sometimes called structured wiring panels or distribution boxes. Don’t get confused if a website or contractor uses one of these terms. Cables commonly feed throughout the house from either the attic or the crawlspace under the house. Since not all homes have a crawlspace, the attic is a more popular choice. Go to your wiring panel location and make sure there are hollow walls there that you can run wires up. Most sheet rock walls should be suitable. Find a point in this area that you can feed a wire straight up into the attic from.  You don't need precise measurements for running these cables. If the cable ends up too long, you can just cut or roll it when it reaches the end of its route. The wiring plan gives you a general idea of the route the wires will take, and also marks cable locations for future repairs. Check the blueprints of your house for potential routes that you aren't aware of. You can use existing holes in the wall to run cables as long as they don’t have electrical wires running through them. Electrical wires will interfere with the signal. If all the holes have electrical wires, then you’ll have to drill new ones. Cables distribute throughout the house from the attic or crawlspace. Make a plan of all the rooms that need a cable hookup. Then map how each cable will feed through the attic and at which points they will enter each room. Cables usually feed down from the attic inside walls. For an easier, but less visually-appealing job, you can also cut through the room's ceiling and feed the cable down this way. If you have trouble drawing up your own diagram or using your home blueprints, search for a software program to help. There are many products that let you scan in your home blueprints and plug in which cables you want to install. The programs then produce the ideal wiring plan for your home that you can follow easily.  Some programs are free and some are paid. Research different ones to see which is best for your needs. Don't try to skimp by using a cheap program if it isn't a quality one. Some paid programs offer free trials that you can use to plan one job. See if a program you're interested in offers a trial. Summary:","output":"To plan the path for wires in your house, first find out which rooms need cable hookups, like rooms with a TV, phone, or computer. Then, choose a good spot for the wiring panel, which is like a big box where all the wires connect. People usually put it in the basement, laundry room, or a closet. Now, figure out how to run the wires from the panel to each room, usually through the attic. It helps to make a plan or use a software program. Remember that you don't want the wires too close to electrical wires, because they can cause problems. And don't worry if the cables are too long, you can cut or roll them later."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Title: Undisputed II: Last Man Standing Movie plot: Visiting the Russian Federation for a series of boxing matches, George \\"Iceman\\" Chambers is subsequently framed for possession of cocaine and sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick. Following the fight, Steven kills himself out of guilt.After the fight, Chambers (having learnt of the truth from Crot) confronts Boyka, believing that he was responsible for drugging him, and the warden, for going back on the deal.

What is the solution?","output":"Step 1: Combine the 't' terms on the left side of the equation. We have two 't' terms on the left side: 286*t and -289*t. To combine these, we can write: (286 - 289) * t. Then we perform the subtraction: -3 * t. So, the left side of the equation is now: -3*t + 1007 + 17171. Step 2: Simplify the whole numbers on the left side of the equation. We have two whole numbers on the left side: 1007 and 17171. To combine these, we can write: 1007 + 17171. Then we perform the addition: 18178. So, the simplified equation becomes: -3*t + 18178 = -301*t. Step 3: Isolate the 't' terms on one side of the equation and the whole numbers on the other side of the equation. To do this, we will add 3*t to both sides of the equation: -3*t + 3*t + 18178 = -301*t + 3*t. This simplifies to 18178 = -298*t. Step 4: Solve for 't'. We want to isolate 't', so we should get rid of the -298 coefficient. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -298: 18178/(-298) = (-298*t)/(-298). This simplifies to t = -61.

Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Pete is a religious man who volunteers his time at Crossroads Detox, a facility supported by local churches, which Ray jokingly refers to as the \\"Jesus Shop.\\" In contrast, Ray has a more cynical and practical approach to the addiction issues faced by their clients. Pete identifies himself as a born-again \\"fundie\\" (fundamentalist), who works as a CPA at H&R Block. Through their various late-night phone calls, the two men have developed a mutual respect for one another, despite their differing perspectives. They assist each other in different ways - Ray provides his experience and advice to Pete when dealing with difficult clients, while Pete has offered his tax services to Ray at no cost. During this particular conversation, Pete mentions that he has a \\"recalcitrant\\" client - someone who is uncooperative, difficult, and resistant to change. Ray acknowledges that alcohol is a negative form of self-medication, leading to behavioral problems and the need for interventions like the services offered at the detox centers. He also reminds Pete that their job is to help these clients transform into more compliant, willing, and receptive individuals. The statements made by Pete in the passage reveal a few aspects of his character: 1. \\"Alcohol is bad medicine.\\" - This demonstrates his belief in the detrimental effects of alcohol on a person's life and recognizes the need for intervention and support to overcome addiction. 2. Not enough information - Pete may feel that he doesn't know everything there is to know about drugs and addiction, which is why he seeks Ray's advice. 3. \\"I can't do your taxes\\" - Although this statement is not found in the passage, it may suggest that Pete has a limit to the favors he can offer to Ray. Still, their relationship remains amicable due to the mutual respect and understanding between them. 4. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" - This illustrates Pete's more formal and polite language compared to Ray's more casual approach. It also reveals Pete's unique terminology when referring to the individuals who are seeking help in the detox center, opting to use a more descriptive word than derogatory terms like \\"shithead.\\" In summary, the conversation between Ray and Pete showcases their contrasting beliefs, backgrounds, and attitudes in relation to the work they do at the respective detox centers. Both men find common ground in their commitment to help individuals struggling with addiction and recognize the value in drawing on each other's expertise and experience. Through their ongoing communication and collaboration, Ray and Pete continue to navigate the challenges and difficulties of their line of work, striving to make a difference in the lives of those they serve."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Text: Genetic sexual attraction (GSA) is a term for an overwhelming sexual attraction that may develop between close blood relatives who first meet as adults. Question: can siblings fall in love with each other? OPT: i. no; ii. yes;","output":"Yes, siblings can fall in love with each other, but it is essential to understand the complexity and various factors contributing to such relationships. Genetic Sexual Attraction (GSA) is one of the primary reasons that could lead to siblings falling in love. It generally occurs when close blood relatives, who initially did not have an opportunity to form emotional attachments during childhood or early life, meet or reunite as adults. This can result in intense feelings of attraction and arousal, which might be confusing and difficult to control. Although GSA is not the only reason why siblings can fall in love, it is the main factor contributing to such cases. There are several reasons why siblings can develop GSA or form romantic feelings for each other: 1. Absence of Westermarck effect: The Westermarck effect is a psychological theory that explains why people who grow up in close proximity with each other during their early years typically do not develop sexual attractions towards one another. Siblings separated at birth or in early childhood who meet later in life might not have experienced the Westermarck effect, which allows the siblings to bypass the natural aversion to sexual relationships with close relatives. 2. Environmental factors: Growing up in unstable or unhealthy family environments could lead to emotionally unfulfilled siblings seeking solace, comfort, and support from each other. This emotional closeness might eventually develop into a more profound romantic connection. 3. Shared interests and values: Siblings, especially those separated during their early years, might find that they share common values, interests, and experiences upon reuniting. This could create a strong bond and possibly lead to romantic attraction. 4. Curiosity: The novelty of discovering a previously unknown sibling and learning about their lives and experiences can create a sense of intrigue and curiosity, which might intensify emotional attachments leading to a romantic relationship. It's essential to emphasize that relationships between siblings are surrounded by ethical, moral, and legal concerns. Incestuous relationships are illegal in many jurisdictions and often carry severe penalties. Furthermore, relationships between siblings are prone to emotional turmoil and could be detrimental to their mental, emotional, and social wellbeing. In conclusion, while it is possible for siblings to fall in love, recognizing and addressing the potential risks and consequences of such relationships are critical. It's important for individuals experiencing these feelings to seek psychological, emotional, and moral support from friends, family, or professionals in order to maintain healthy relationships and overcome any potential complications."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  and a hint : Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  Please answer this question : Which would be lighter, item A or item B?

He stopped buying at the shop and started going to the store instead, because the store had fair prices. The shop, which he had been frequenting for years, had somehow lost its touch. The once-respectable establishment had begun to charge exorbitant amounts for even the most basic items, driving customers away. The store, on the other hand, was something of a revelation. The store was located a few blocks farther from his home, but the short additional walk was not much of a burden and well worth the savings. It was a well-organized and clean business, with wide aisles that were continuously stocked with an array of fresh, high-quality products. Upon entering, he was always greeted with a warm, genuine smile from the friendly staff. These employees were attentive and eager to help, always willing to answer any questions he might have about their products or guide him to a specific item he was looking for. The store also invested in getting to know their customers. They were truly interested in their shoppers' needs and preferences, often stocking new and unique items based on feedback and requests. There was a certain sense of community within the store, as the regular customers began to recognize one another and engage in friendly conversation. This social atmosphere was something he had been missing at the shop, and it made the new store feel like a home away from home. At the store, he marveled at the selection available. In every category, there were multiple brands and varieties, all at competitive prices. The store was also known for having frequent sales and promotions, offering even better deals to its customers. With an emphasis on locally-sourced and organic products, the store was not only meeting his budgetary needs, but also his desire to support sustainable and responsible practices. One aspect of the store he particularly appreciated was the dedication to reducing waste. All products were either minimally packaged or sold in bulk, allowing customers to choose the amount they needed and avoid unnecessary plastic or cardboard packaging. In addition, the store's reusable bag policy encouraged customers to reduce their reliance on single-use plastic bags. There was also a sense of fun and exploration at the store. Regular events, such as food tastings, cooking demonstrations, and seminars on a variety of topics aligned with his interests. It was not just a place to shop, but a hub for learning and personal growth, catering to every aspect of the modern consumer's lifestyle. Over time, he found himself looking forward to each visit to the store. The excitement of discovering new products, the camaraderie with fellow shoppers, and the uncompromising commitment to fair prices made it his top choice for all his shopping needs. As he looked back, he couldn't help but feel both a sense of sadness for the decline of the shop and a newfound gratitude for the opportunity to have found an alternative. While the memories of his years spent shopping at the old shop would forever hold a place in his heart, he knew that he would continue to build new memories and experiences at the store—the place where he found fair prices, quality products, and a sense of belonging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wilhelm Justus Goebel was born January 4, 1856, in Albany Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the son of Wilhelm and Augusta (Groenkle) Goebel, immigrants from Hanover, Germany. The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their German heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the English spelling of his name. In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated his seat in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of lieutenant governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was not to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election close - decided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.  With only the two years remaining in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed and sent to the Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.  In 1890, Goebel was a delegate to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as a delegate, Goebel showed little interest in participating in the process of creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly. Were his ideas well received?","output":"While some of Wilhelm Goebel's ideas and actions were well received, others faced opposition. His focus on railroad regulation and championing labor causes appealed to many citizens in his district, which helped him win elections. His actions against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, such as serving on the committee that uncovered violations by the railroad lobby and defending the Railroad Commission, made him a hero in his district and secured him re-elections to the Kentucky Senate. However, his political career was also marked by contentious moments, such as the close victory in the 1887 election due to the rise of the Union Labor party, and his lack of active participation in the process of creating a new Kentucky Constitution during the 1890 convention. Overall, Wilhelm Goebel's ideas and actions were well received by certain segments of the population, particularly those who shared his concerns about railroad regulation and labor rights, but there were instances where his actions faced opposition and close competition from other political groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change.

Answer a question about this article: During the First World War, to avoid ground fights between brothers, many Alsatians served as sailors in the Kaiserliche Marine and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918, which left Alsace-Lorraine without a nominal head of state. The sailors returned home and tried to found a republic. While Jacques Peirotes, at this time deputy at the Landrat Elsass-Lothringen and just elected mayor of Strasbourg, proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic, a self-proclaimed government of Alsace-Lorraine declared independence as the \\"Republic of Alsace-Lorraine\\". French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power. At the arrival of the French soldiers, many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order (which can be seen and is described in detail in the reference video below). Although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had insisted that the région was self-ruling by legal status, as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state, France tolerated no plebiscite, as granted by the League of Nations to some eastern German territories at this time, because Alsatians were considered by the French public as fellow Frenchmen liberated from German rule. Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles.

However, the context it's used in is important. Step 2: Analyze the overall sentiment - The statement compares the movie to the \\"synergistic impulse\\" behind it. The movie is \\"not as terrible\\" as that impulse, meaning it is somewhat better, but not necessarily good or positively praised. It implies a less-negative outlook on the movie, while still maintaining a somewhat negative stance.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  and the situation: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

Question: \\"Why were people dying in India in the 18th century?\\"  Context: \\"During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"People were dying in India in the 18th century due to several reasons, which can be analyzed step by step: 1. Military conflicts: As the context states, during the middle decades of the 18th century, there were outbreaks of military conflicts such as the Carnatic Wars. The English East India Company and the French Compagnie française des Indes orientales, along with local rulers, were vying for power in the wake of the decline of the Mughal Empire. Military conflicts often result in casualties, both among combatants and civilians caught in the crossfire. 2. The decline of the Mughal Empire: The decline of the Mughal Empire led to a power vacuum and political instability in the region. Local rulers and foreign companies struggled to seize control, which contributed to the overall unrest, and may have led to a decline in public health and safety, causing more deaths. 3. Colonial rule and exploitation: The British East India Company gained control of Bengal after winning the Battle of Plassey in 1757. As the Company increased its territories, it exploited resources and people for its own benefit. Land and taxation policies often led to famines that caused numerous deaths. The most notorious example was the Bengal Famine of 1770, during which an estimated 10 million people died. 4. Epidemics and diseases: The 18th century was a time of limited medical knowledge and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. People in India, like in many parts of the world, faced a variety of diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and malaria, causing widespread deaths. The disarray during military conflicts and the decline of the Mughal Empire would have affected sanitation, clean water availability, and overall public health, increasing the spread of such diseases. 5. Forced labor and military service: The British Indian Army consisted largely of Indian sepoys, who were often recruited or conscripted by force. This led to many young men leaving their homes and families, with some never returning due to injuries or fatalities sustained in battles or other military conflicts. In conclusion, people were dying in India in the 18th century primarily due to military conflicts, political instability, colonial exploitation, epidemics and diseases, and forced labor and military service."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: World Without End Movie plot: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The \\"mutates\\" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance).

Animal: Most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals. Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

In fact, the given premise and hypothesis are contradictory to each other. Let's examine both statements in more detail to understand why this is the case. Premise: A man with a blue, yellow, and green swimming cap is wearing goggles and swimming. This premise describes a situation in which there is a man who is actively swimming. He is wearing a swimming cap with blue, yellow, and green colors, along with a pair of goggles. The man's actions and attire both indicate that he is engaged in an aquatic activity, which is swimming, as specified. Hypothesis: Nobody is swimming. On the other hand, the hypothesis completely negates the scenario presented in the premise. The hypothesis asserts that there is no individual engaged in swimming at the scene being discussed. This statement is incongruous with the premise, which has already established that we have at least one person – the man with the swimming cap – who is undeniably swimming. Since the premise and hypothesis bear conflicting information about whether or not someone is swimming, we can conclude that accepting the premise as true will invalidate the hypothesis. This renders it impossible to accept the hypothesis as true while simultaneously acknowledging the truth of the premise. Thus, if the premise is true, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is also true.

Suspect: Jesus Estopellan has been charged with first degree murder. But when he found Webster in the car as well, he gunned him down too. The 21-year-old reportedly told detectives he wanted to make sure there were no witnesses to his crime. The students had been friends at Red Mountain High School and hundreds of friends in Mesa, Arizona, attended a vigil for the pair after the shooting on Wednesday in the town of Mesa. Detectives also told how Webster made a frantic 911 call as his friend lay dead in the SUV and he died from his injuries. Webster's mother Sheila told Fox: 'He's my everything to me, everything to my life. 'He's [Estopellan] gonna have to pay for it...Just my boy's never coming home and he didn't deserve it.'

Article: Beer is the world's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Brightly colored hummers can beat their wings up to 50 times per second as they hover over flowers, extracting nectar. And while common belief among biologists has long held that their feeding is facilitated by ‘wicking’ – capillary action that allows liquid to flow through small spaces without benefit of gravity – a UConn study published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, debunks that theory.      The research, conducted by research scientist Alejandro Rico-Guevara and Professor Margaret Rubega from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Tai-Hsi Fan, associate professor of mechanical engineering, looked at 18 hummingbird species from seven of the nine main hummingbird groups throughout the Americas. They concluded that the ‘wicking theory’ is wrong, and that the bird’s tongue actually acts as a tiny pump.      Rico-Guevara explains that a hummingbird’s tongue, which can be stuck out about the same length as its beak, is tipped with two long skinny tubes, or grooves. Rather than wicking, he says, the nectar is drawn into the tongue by the elastic expansion of the grooves after they are squeezed flat by the beak.      The tongue structure is collapsed during the time it crosses the space between the bill tip and the nectar pool, but once the tip contacts the nectar surface, the supply of fluid allows the collapsed groove to gradually recover to a relaxed cylindrical shape as the nectar fills it.      When the hummingbird squeezes nectar off its tongue during protrusion, it is collapsing the grooves and loading elastic energy into the groove walls. That energy subsequently facilitates the pumping of more nectar.      Actually, everything is relative. When Rico-Guevara says the collapsed groove ‘gradually recovers’ as it fills with nectar, he is talking about an event that is infinitesimally brief, since the entire action takes place in less than a tenth of a second.      In fact, it is the speed that first made Rubega and Rico-Guevara skeptical about the role that wicking might play in the feeding process. They were convinced that the slow fill speed of capillary action would limit the hummingbird’s rate of absorbing nectar and thus its energy intake rate. This is where Fan’s expertise in fluid mechanics and biological transport came in handy.      “We could see the actual drinking mechanism through high speed video,” says Rico-Guevara, “but we couldn’t develop the fluid dynamics model needed to test our biophysical hypothesis.” In collaboration with Fan, an expert in fluid mechanics and biological transport phenomena, the biologists were able to test different hypotheses and validate the physics behind their explanation.      Rubega says most previous studies involving hummingbird feeding were conducted under artificial conditions in laboratories where the birds had access to feeders that had far more liquid available than would actually be found in flowers in the wild.      The research she and Rico-Guevara conducted involved filming free-living hummingbirds that had never been handled as they fed at modified transparent feeders that simulated the shape, nectar volumes, and concentrations of actual hummingbird-pollinated flowers. The data they collected from this wild population is the largest data set on hummingbird feeding mechanics to date.      Rubega says it’s important to understand evolution and the relationship between flowers and birds. She notes that flowers don’t give nectar away without expecting something in return.      “Nectar is kind of a bribe,” she says. “It’s payment for the hummingbird to come frequently enough so that they will go off and act as pollinators to other flowers of the same species. ”      Rico-Guevera adds that during their evolution, hummingbirds became what they are because of their skill at drinking nectar.      The researchers say their study found an excellent match between what mathematical models predicted and what they were observing through high-speed video.      “Our research shows how they really drink and provides the first mathematical tools to accurately model their energy intake,” says Rico-Guevara, “which will in turn inform our understanding of their foraging decisions and ecology.” ||||| Recent research shows that the birds take in plant fluid, real or artificial, at ultra-high speeds using a pumping method – not a wicking one, as previously believed.      Did the ALS 'Ice Bucket Challenge' really help research? Scientists say yes.      Hummingbirds are named for the sound of their rapidly beating wings, but now their tongues have captured scientists' attention.      These tiny birds can suck 10 drops of nectar out of a flower every 15 milliseconds, researchers at the University of Connecticut recently discovered. For nearly two centuries, scientists have thought the birds used a much slower “wicking” technique, LiveScience reported.      It turns out that hummingbird tongues do not wick – they pump.      By capturing video footage of 18 species of hummingbirds drinking from artificial “flowers,” the research team – led by research scientist Alejandro Rico-Guevara, ecology and evolutionary biology professor Margaret Rubega, and mechanical engineering associate professor Tai-Hsi Fan – found that the birds’ tongues have tube-like grooves that rest in a collapsed state, but open and fill with nectar upon contact with flowers.      “The tongue works as an elastic micropump; fluid at the tip is driven into the tongue's grooves by forces resulting from re-expansion of a collapsed section,” the report says.      The study’s methodology surpasses that of previous hummingbird research, Professor Rubega said in a university news release, because it comes closer than ever to approximating real-life conditions.      In previous studies, captive birds sipped nectar from feeders in laboratories containing far more liquid than a real flower. This time, scientists filmed wild hummingbirds feeding from transparent feeders that mimic the shape, nectar amounts, and calorie concentrations of hummingbirds' favorite flowers.      The study has yielded the largest data set of any hummingbird study to date – the result of five years’ work. Dr. Rico-Guevara told LiveScience that building the transparent “flowers” was a challenging but essential part of the research, since “when the [hummingbird's] bill goes inside a flower, you don't see what is happening inside at all.” The design used transparent tubes filled with artificial nectar, with cameras set up nearby.      The next challenge was observing different species of hummingbirds. The only hummingbird found east of the Mississippi is the Ruby-throated Hummingbird, so the researchers had to go further afield to gather a broad sample. By setting up shop in a number of locations across the Americas – including Connecticut, Texas, California, Ecuador, Brazil, and Colombia – they gathered footage of 32 different birds from 18 different species.      \\"I tried to get as many different kinds of hummingbirds as possible,\\" Rico-Guevara told LiveScience. \\"Not just to get different species, but [also] the crazy ones, the extreme ones, just to be able to generalize what happens.\\"      The discovery of the micro-pump method of feeding may lead scientists to revisit previous hummingbird research, Rico-Guevara said. Earlier studies indicate that some flowers produce diluted nectar, which would be helpful for hummingbirds feeding using capillary “wicking” as previously assumed, but which is unnecessary for micro-pump feeding.      The new study was published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.      “Our research shows how they really drink and provides the first mathematical tools to accurately model their energy intake,” Rico-Guevara said in the news release, “which will in turn inform our understanding of their foraging decisions and ecology.” ||||| Published on Aug 19, 2015      UConn researchers examined 18 hummingbird species throughout the Americas for a recent study on hummingbird tongues. A common belief among biologists has long held that their feeding is facilitated by ‘wicking’ – capillary action that allows liquid to flow through small spaces without benefit of gravity. However, UConn researchers Alejandro Rico-Guevara, Maragret Rubega and Tai-Hsi Fan concluded that the ‘wicking theory’ is wrong, and that the bird’s tongue actually acts as a tiny pump. For more information on the study, check out this link: http://today.uconn.edu/2015/08/hummin... ||||| The slender hummingbird tongue has been misunderstood for more than 180 years, a new study finds.      Since 1833, scientists thought that hummingbird tongues used capillary action — a phenomenon in which liquid flows through narrow areas, even working against gravity — to slurp up floral nectar. Researchers got this intriguing (but wrong) idea because the birds have long groves on their tongues that look like open cylinders, said Alejandro Rico-Guevara, lead researcher of the new study and a research associate of functional morphology at the University of Connecticut.      But capillary action is slow, at least by hummingbird standards. Using high-speed videos, researchers in the new study determined that hummingbird tongues act as elastic micropumps, allowing the birds to feed at rapid speeds, Rico-Guevara said. [See Photos of Hummingbirds Sticking Out Their Tongues]      Most people are familiar with simple pumps — the drinking straw, for instance. When sipping a beverage through a straw, people contort their cheeks to create a vacuum in the straw and suction up the liquid, Rico-Guevara said.      The hummingbird's tongue works in a slightly similar way, but without a vacuum. After zipping toward a flower, the hummingbird flattens its outstretched tongue, and \\"the compressed tongue remains flattened until it contacts the nectar,\\" the researchers wrote in the study. \\"After contact with the nectar surface, the tongue reshapes filling entirely with nectar.\\"      A juvenile male black-throated mango hummingbird in Finca El Colibrí Gorriazul, Fusagasugá, Colombia. Without the use of any muscles or nerves, a hummingbird's tongue can rapidly expand to pull in nectar from a flower. Credit: Kristiina Hurme      To pull in the nectar, the top of the tongue (the part closer to the mouth) bends, so it's no longer flat, and this bending stores elastic energy, Rico-Guevara said. That energy helps draw the nectar out of the flower and into the bird's mouth, he said.      \\"We show that the tongue works as an elastic micropump,\\" the researchers said. \\"Fluid at the tip is driven into the tongue's grooves by forces resulting from re-expansion of a collapsed section\\" of the tongue closer to the mouth.      This fast technique allows the bird to drain between five and 10 drops of nectar from a flower within 15 milliseconds (about 100th of a second), Rico-Guevara said.      Transparent flowers      Setting up the experiment took five years, Rico-Guevara said, and involved constructing \\"flowers\\" researchers could look into.      \\"When the [hummingbird's] bill goes inside a flower, you don't see what is happening inside at all,\\" Rico-Guevara told Live Science. \\"My first challenge was to make see-through flowers.\\"      He used tiny glass tubes, filled them with artificial nectar and set up the high-speed video cameras near the tubes. This setup was repeated in a number of places, including Connecticut, Texas, California, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil.      \\"I tried to get as many different kinds of hummingbirds as possible,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"Not just to get different species, but [also] the crazy ones, the extreme ones, just to be able to generalize what happens\\" when they feed.      In all, he filmed 96 foraging bouts, which included 32 birds from 18 species licking up artificial nectar from the transparent tubes.

Hummingbirds can extend their long, skinny tongues twice as far as the bill, which helps them reach nectar deep inside flowers. Credit: Kristiina Hurme      The researchers spent hours examining the footage. In 2011, they published a study explaining that the hummingbird tongue is not a capillary tube, but instead works by trapping fluid. However, they still didn't know exactly how it worked. In the new study, the researchers explained that the tongue is a tiny pump that can pull in nectar.      Rico-Guevara developed two computer models with Tai-Hsi Fan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and expert on fluid dynamics at the University of Connecticut, to determine how the hummingbird's tongue works. One model represented capillary action, and the other emulated the elastic micropump. [Images: Beautiful Hummingbirds of the World]      \\"We translated all of the pieces into mathematics to create predictions that we could test,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"The match was really great with the elastic micropump one, so we were very happy.\\"      The models showed that if hummingbirds used capillarity in the wild, they would have to slow way down, he said. The elastic micropump method allows hummingbirds to lick a flower up to 20 times per second, or at 20 hertz.      \\"But if they were using capillarity, they would have to slow it down to 5 hertz,\\" Rico-Guevara said. \\"Which is still pretty fast, but when you're out there and you have so much pressure [to survive], every millisecond counts.\\"      The finding may prompt scientists to give existing hummingbird research a second look. For instance, earlier studies suggested that some flowers developed dilute nectar, which is easier for hummingbirds to consume via capillary action than is concentrated nectar.      But if hummingbirds don't use capillary action, then it's unclear why certain flowers have dilute nectar, Rico-Guevara said. (Dilution levels don't matter much for the elastic micropump method, he said.)      \\"We need to develop the models again and see why those flowers have those concentrations in general,\\" Rico-Guevara said.      The study will be published online Wednesday (Aug. 19) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.      Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel.

This article: Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

On the left side of the equation, we can combine the two terms with w: -87w + 51w = -36w So, the left side of the equation becomes: -36w + 2535 On the right side of the equation, we can also combine the two terms with w: -51w - 50w = -101w So, the right side of the equation becomes: -101w Now, the equation looks like this: -36w + 2535 = -101w Next, we eliminate the w term from one side to make w stand alone on the other side. To do this, we add 101w to both sides of the equation: -36w + 101w + 2535 = -101w + 101w Combining the w terms on the left side: 65w + 2535 = 0 Now, we need to isolate w by moving the constant term to the other side. To do this, we subtract 2535 from both sides: 65w + 2535 - 2535 = 0 - 2535 Which simplifies to: 65w = -2535 Finally, to find the value of w, we divide both sides of the equation by 65: 65w / 65 = -2535 / 65 w = -39 And so, the solution to the equation -87w + 51w + 2535 = -51w - 50w for w is: w = -39"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under the judge's order, the officers will be held for 30 days, Jose Luis Manjarrez, a spokesman for the Mexican Attorney-General's Office, said Monday. They will be transferred to Mexico City from the state of Morelos, where they are being held, he said.      The 12 officers are under investigation in relation to five charges, including attempted murder, according to one of their lawyers, Marco Aurelio Gonzalez.      Following the shooting incident Friday, two U.S. Embassy employees, described by a senior U.S. government official as U.S. citizens, were taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening wounds. A member of the Mexican Navy who was with them in the vehicle suffered light bruises, according to a statement from the Mexican Navy.      The statement provided the following account of events:      Just Watched Diplomatic vehicle shot up in Mexico replay More Videos ... Diplomatic vehicle shot up in Mexico 01:14 PLAY VIDEO      The incident unfolded at 8 a.m. Friday, as the two embassy employees and the Mexican were traveling to a military facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) earlier, they had left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias, a thinly populated area off the main road.      When a vehicle containing Federal Police approached and its occupants brandished their weapons, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade them and return to the main highway. At that point, the police sprayed bullets into the black SUV with diplomatic plates.      Moments later, three other vehicles carrying Federal Police joined the attack, also shooting at the U.S. Embassy vehicle.      By now, the Mexican Navy official who was in the embassy vehicle had contacted personnel at a nearby military installation, who arrived after the firing had ended and cordoned off the site, the Navy statement said.      Both embassy employees were taken, under Federal Police guard, to a hospital.      Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat.      In addition to the attempted murder charge, the detained police officers are facing charges of abuse of authority, damage to property, bodily harm and abuse of public duty, according to Gonzalez.      The lawyer said that the officers were investigating a kidnapping when they came across the embassy vehicle, which ignored their requests to stop.      The Mexican Public Security Secretariat has acknowledged in a statement that the officers fired on the armored vehicle with diplomatic plates while they were looking for a group of suspected criminals.      The U.S. Embassy in Mexico is cooperating with the investigation into the shooting incident, Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Monday.      \\"I'm not going to get ahead of the investigation. I think we're going to wait and see what that concludes,\\" she said when asked whether the incident was an attack or an ambush.      The violent incident is the third in recent years involving U.S. officials in Mexico. In 2010, a U.S. consular employee, her husband and another man died in a gun attack in Ciudad Juarez.      And in 2011, a U.S. immigration and customs agent was killed and another was wounded in an attack by an armed group on a highway in the state of San Luis Potosi.      Violence related to drug gangs has increased in recent years in Morelos, the state where the shooting incident took place Friday. ||||| 12 Mexico police held over US embassy car shooting      MEXICO CITY — A Mexican judge ordered 12 federal police officers held for 40 days on Monday as prosecutors mull charges against them for shooting at a US embassy car and wounding two US government employees.      The officers are being treated as suspects over Friday's incident, when a sport-utility vehicle with diplomatic plates was chased by four cars south of Mexico City and hit by a hail of bullets.      \\"We will continue to deepen the investigation,\\" Attorney General Marisela Morales Ibanez told reporters. \\"Right now we have an abuse of power.\\"      \\"We are cooperating with all national and international authorities that we must collaborate with to clarify the events,\\" Morales added.      She did not indicate what other charges the officers could face apart from abuse of power over the shooting, which the US embassy has described as an ambush. The judge must decide the degree of responsibility of each suspect.      \\"No crime and no investigative leads are being ruled out at the moment,\\" she said. \\"This is why we asked for provisional detention, so we have the time we need to carry out an exhaustive investigation.\\"      The officers will be transferred from the attorney general's regional office in Cuernavaca, the capital of the state of Morelos, to a provisional detention center in Mexico City.      Relatives of the officers protested outside the federal prosecutor's office in Cuernavaca, holding signs saying \\"Deprived of their freedom for doing their jobs\\" and \\"Mr. President, we ask for your support and justice.\\"      The Mexican navy and public security ministry say the officers were hunting for criminals south of the capital when they shot at the diplomatic car. A Mexican navy captain traveling with the US employees was slightly injured.      The US government employees and the Mexican navy captain were heading to a military facility when a carload of gunmen chased and fired at them on a dirt road, the navy and public security ministry said in a statement.      When the US vehicle veered back onto a highway, three more cars joined the chase and shot at the SUV, which was riddled with bullets near Tres Marias, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital.      The US embassy has not identified the two wounded employees or the nature of their work in Mexico, which is in the throes of a drug war that has left some 50,000 people dead since 2006.      Mexico's ombudsman, Raul Plascencia, said the shooting was an \\"extremely serious mistake by the officers, which could be an orchestrated action.\\"      \\"There is no justification for such an excessive use of force,\\" the head of the National Human Rights Commission told a news conference.

The MA took my blood pressure and did not bother to relay the reading to me. Neither she nor the Dr. asked if I had any concerns that I wanted to discuss. The reason for my visit was for my annual physical, discuss the removal of a paragard IUD and the placement of a Mirena IUD. (I am menopausal and am on estrogen therapy so I need opposing progesterone). I have conducted much research of published studies supporting the use of the Mirena IUD to provide opposed progesterone while using estrogen for menopausal symptoms.  I told him I did not want to use an oral progesterone due to the side effects (specifically weight gain) as studies have shown that direct vaginal application (Mirena IUD) or transdermal patches do not produce these side effects.THERE ARE RECENT PUBLISHED MEDICAL STUDIES PROVING THIS!! His comment was that he would not know why anyone would want to use the Mirena IUD for this purpose and that the claims of side effects of oral progesterone (weight gain) were false.

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience.  Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls.  Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Who is Havelock Ellis and what did he discover about children and sexuality?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: -  A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step in the process of a red giant's evolution, after the outer layers are shed and only the inner core remains, is the formation of a white dwarf along with a possible planetary nebula. When the red giant can no longer sustain nuclear fusion at its core due to the depletion of its fuel, the core temperature drops, and it starts to contract under its own gravity. Concurrently, the outer envelope of the star expands and the star becomes a red giant. Eventually, the hydrogen shell burning surrounding the inert core does not produce enough thermal pressure to counterbalance the gravitational forces, and the star can no longer sustain nuclear fusion in its core. As a result, the outer layers begin to drift away from the core, leading to the ejection of the star's envelope, which then expands and illuminates, forming a planetary nebula. This phenomenon occurs because the ejected gas and dust, consisting mainly of hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of heavier elements, are ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the hot core. The inner core, which is made of carbon and oxygen, is left behind and is called a white dwarf. These remnants do not undergo further fusion reactions due to their degenerate state and lack of significant mass, but they still emit light and heat as they cool down. These white dwarfs usually have a mass that is close to that of our Sun, but their size is only slightly larger than that of Earth, making them extremely dense objects. The white dwarf will continue to radiate its leftover heat into space for billions of years, gradually cooling down and progressively dimming until it forms a cold, dark 'black dwarf,' which is an extremely dense, non-luminous object no longer visible to the naked eye. However, it is important to note that not all stars end their lives in the same way. For more massive stars (greater than eight solar masses), the process might differ, involving core-collapse supernovae and ultimately forming neutron stars or black holes instead of white dwarfs. The specific evolutionary pathway of a star depends on various factors such as its initial mass, chemical composition, and interaction with its stellar environment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\".  In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.","output":"This text is about Barack Hussein Obama II, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

They said they \\"appreciated the patience\\" shown by customers as high demand led to waiting times of more than an hour on Monday morning. Organisers said there was no need to rush as the public had four weeks to place requests for tickets. After that period, tickets will be allocated by a \\"fair and simple draw\\". A Glasgow 2014 spokeswoman said: \\"We have already processed many thousands of applications through our website and continue to do so as quickly as possible.\\" She added: \\"But this is not a sprint - everyone has until 16 September to make their choices and get their applications in and we encourage everyone to get involved in Scotland's biggest-ever festival of world-class sport.\\" Commonwealth Games: Tickets Q&A The 11-day games, which begin on 23 July 2014, will see 4,500 athletes compete in 17 sports across 14 venues. An official ticket guide was released last month and the first phase ticketing process runs until 16 September. Olympic silver medallist swimmer Michael Jamieson marked the start of sales by diving into the refurbished pool at the Tollcross International Swimming Centre. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014, said: \\"There is no advantage to putting your application in on the first day, a day in the middle or at the end. \\"We will not process any applications until that phase closes. \\"Our advice to everybody is go online or grab a copy of our ticketing brochure, sit down with family and friends and work out what works for you.\\" Applications can be made online with debit or credit cards or by post, using the form in the ticket guide. The ticket-buying process will be operated by Ticketmaster, who sold 10.9 million Olympics tickets but came in for criticism over the system of bidding for batches of tickets. The Commonwealth Games organisers have been keen to stress that lessons have been learned from the London Olympics ticketing problems. Commonwealth Games: Golden ticket They said they had concentrated on keeping the ticketing process simple, making sure that payment was easy and allowing fans to be confident that there are lots of tickets available. At last year's Olympics, blocks of empty seats reserved for \\"the Olympic family\\" or sponsors were a major talking point at early events, so Mr Speer said the Glasgow games had made a commitment that at least 70% of all seats, for all sessions at all venues, would be available to the public. Mr Speer said a second phase of ticket sales would run from later in October, with tickets on general sale. But he said the aim of the first round was to give as many people as possible an equal chance of getting tickets. He said people would either get exactly what they wanted when applying for a session or nothing at all. He said there was no chance of people being given tickets for diving if they applied for a swimming session and they would not get three tickets if they applied for four. Ticket prices start from £15 for adults, with half-price concessions on the cheapest tickets available for children and the over-60s. Organisers said about 60% of the tickets were priced at £25 or less and all included use of public transport in the local area on the day of the event. However, the more popular sessions could cost much more than that. Spectators hoping to witness prized events such as the 100m sprint final at Hampden on Monday 28 July, which could feature Jamaica's Usain Bolt, will pay between £30 and £90. The only seats priced higher are the £120 ringside views for certain boxing sessions. Tickets for the opening ceremony - which takes place on Wednesday 23 July - will cost between £40 and £250. The closing ceremony on Sunday 3 August will be slightly cheaper, with a top price of £200. Despite claims from the organisers that the ticketing strategy was \\"family-friendly\\", concerns have been raised over the limit on the number of tickets for which people can apply at certain sessions. The majority of the more popular events, such as swimming, athletics and track cycling, will have a four-ticket per application limit, which could exclude larger families. Mr Speer said for about 60% of the sessions the ticket limit was eight or 10 per application. However, it was lowered to four for sessions \\"where we feel confident there will be enormous demand\\". Mr Speer said: \\"We want to make sure we allow the greatest number of people to have the chance to have those tickets and obviously if people are coming in and potentially ordering 10 tickets that, by definition, reduces the number of families and households that will get a chance to go.

She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability.

The Get Up Kids are an American rock band from Kansas City, Missouri. Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-1990s emo scene, otherwise known as the \\"second wave\\" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation.  It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled \\"The Get Up Kids / Coalesce\\". For the split, each band covered one of the other's songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of \\"Second Place\\", and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of \\"Harvest of Maturity\\".  A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase.  While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids' announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label's insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band's income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record \\"Don't Hate Me\\" from Four Minute Mile for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was \\"the best that [they could] write\\". Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based Vagrant Records. He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead, offering them 50,000 to record a second album, as well as their own imprint, Heroes & Villains Records.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was Four Minute Mile their album name?","output":"Yes, \\"Four Minute Mile\\" was their album name.

Her father, whom she loved dearly, died of tuberculosis a few years ago. Elina finds consolation in wandering out on the dangerous marshlands to have imaginary conversations with her dead father. Elina also contracted tuberculosis, but recovered. Because she was ill for so long, Elina is obliged to repeat a whole year at school. However, since she missed so much schooling as a result, she has been put in a new class with a different teacher, the strict Tora Holm.

A massive car bomb tore through the heart of a bustling marketplace in Peshawar, Pakistan, Wednesday, killing at least 100 people -- including many women and children -- and injuring at least 200 others, officials said. A vehicle packed with 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives detonated at the Meena Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops popular with women. The impact destroyed buildings, burying people underneath the rubble, and sparked massive fires in the shops, mosques, and homes. In a year of seemingly endless militant attacks in Pakistan, this was the deadliest. Those who survived described a narrow escape:. \\"I ducked quickly and when I looked up it was complete darkness,\\" said Imdad. \\"I couldn't see anyone. The cars and the van were lying upside down.\\" Are you there? Send your photos and videos to iReport. Fareed Ullah, a student at a nearby mosque, was injured when he fell from the second floor as he tried to escape a fire ignited by the blast at the Meena Bazaar. \\"We only saw a red blaze and nothing else,\\" he said from his hospital bed. \\"My friends and I fell from the second floor. We didn't know where we were.\\" The remote-controlled detonation killed at least 100 people and injured as many as 200 others, hospital and government officials said. The deaths include 68 males and 32 females, including 10 children, the head of the main hospital in Peshawar said. The car bomb left a 10-foot-wide crater, and the flames spread quickly through stores selling highly flammable fabric. Residents and shopkeepers expressed outrage that militants were able to carry out the attack in broad daylight, the latest in a string of militant attacks targeting civilians in Peshawar. \\"What kind of security alert is this? It was an explosives-packed car,\\" a middle-aged shopkeeper at Meena Bazaar said. \\"Look at the mosque, it ceases to exist anymore. For God's sake, do something!\\" \\"Increasing chaos\\" in Pakistan. The Peshawar car bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on Pakistan since the October 2007 attack on a homecoming rally for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. More than 135 people were killed in the suicide bombing in Karachi. Bhutto escaped harm, but she was assassinated two months later. Wednesday's bombing happened hours after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to shore up U.S. support in nuclear-armed Pakistan, as it battles a rising Taliban insurgency. Clinton condemned the strike, and dared the militants who were responsible to put down their arms and appeal to the Pakistani people through the political process. \\"If the people behind the attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process, let them come forth to the people and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school, that they want women to be kept back, that they believe they have all the answers,\\" Clinton said in a joint news conference with her Pakistani counterpart in Islamabad. \\"They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is,\\" she said of those responsible for the car bombing in Peshawar. Read more about Clinton's comments on blast. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also condemned the deadly attack, offering his condolences to the victims and their families and directly addressing the attackers. \\"We will not buckle, we will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan,\\" Qureshi said. \\"You are on the run and we know that. We defeated you in Swat and Malakand. You think by attacking innocent people and lives you will shake our determination? No, sir, you will not.\\" The attack is the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province which has been the site of five militant strikes this month alone. A suicide car bombing on October 9 in Khyber Bazaar killed at least 49 people and injured 135 others. And, just last Friday, a car bomb exploded outside a banquet hall in Peshawar, wounding at least 15 people. The massive casualties in Wednesday's bombing prompted a state of emergency at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where most of the injured were treated. The hospital appealed to other medical centers -- and to the public -- to donate blood, hospital officials said. North West Frontier Province is bearing the brunt of the massive civilian displacement from Pakistan's military offensive in the neighboring tribal region along the Afghan border. More than 180,000 civilians have fled to North West Frontier Province from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to the United Nations. Pakistan's military offensive is currently focused on South Waziristan, where the government believes the Pakistani Taliban has masterminded numerous attacks, including the October 10 siege of Pakistan's army headquarters in Rawalpindi, outside Islamabad. That siege and other attacks outside the tribal region have raised concerns about the ability of government forces to maintain control. President Obama signed legislation this month providing an additional 7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years. The White House is working on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Peshawar is a strategic city for both Taliban militants and the U.S. and NATO military, who are waging a battle against Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. Located about 100 miles (167 kilometers) northwest of the capital, Islamabad, Peshawar sits on the main supply route into Afghanistan and is the gateway to Pakistan's ungoverned tribal regions.

The recent incident involving Bennett, a veteran tight end, and the first-round pick, provides a compelling glimpse into the inner workings, pressures, and issues faced by players and teams alike. This article will explore the events surrounding the altercation, the team's response, and the subsequent resolution, with the aim of highlighting the importance of managing internal conflicts and fostering positive interpersonal relationships within a sports team. The incident began during a practice session when Bennett was seen slamming the first-round pick into the ground after an apparent face mask. The aggression displayed by Bennett could be attributed to the high level of competition and the desire for players to establish their position within the team. As tensions escalated, Bennett had to be restrained by his teammates, showcasing the importance of solidarity and collective responsibility in maintaining discipline and order. The consequences of the altercation were swift, with Head coach Marc Trestman cutting short the practice session by ten minutes. This decision highlights the increasing need for coaches to monitor and maintain a healthy team atmosphere, prioritizing player welfare and team cohesion above all else. The Bears organization went a step further by suspending and fining Bennett for his actions, citing 'conduct detrimental to the team.' This move clearly showcases the team's commitment to enforcing a strict code of conduct and ensuring that no player is above the rules, regardless of their status or seniority. Despite the dramatic events, it is important to highlight the subsequent resolution between Bennett and the first-round pick. Both players were able to find common ground and make amends, demonstrating the importance of open communication and mutual respect between individuals with diverse backgrounds and personalities. This reconciliation is a testament to the maturity and leadership displayed by both players and serves as a valuable lesson for teams facing similar challenges. In conclusion, the Bennett incident provides a crucial insight into the trials and tribulations experienced by professional athletes and sports teams. It underscores the importance of managing interpersonal conflicts, maintaining a positive team atmosphere, and fostering mutual respect among teammates. As sports organizations continue to emphasize performance and results, it is essential to recognize the role of individual relationships and team dynamics in achieving these goals.

Not knowing where to get the money, he and a friend decided to host a musical concert to raise money for their education. They went to the great pianist Paderewski. His manager demanded 2,000 for the piano recital . A deal was made and the boys began to work to make the concert a success. The big day arrived. But unfortunately, they hadn't managed to sell enough tickets. The total collection was only 1,600. Disappointed, they went to Paderewski and gave him the entire 1,600, and promised to pay him the rest 400 back as soon as possible. \\"No,\\" said Paderewski. \\"Keep the money you need for your fees.

When the World War broke out, more than l.5 million people went hungry, but there was no food to feed them. Paderewski turned to the US Food and Relief Administration for help. The head there was a man called Herbert Hoover -- who later became the US President. Hoover agreed to help and quickly shipped tons of food to Poland.

The ice bucket challenge has caused a run on freezer cabinets with supermarkets running out of ice as the online trend sweeps Britain. Freezer shelves at many stores are lying empty after shoppers rushed to buy ice in order to take part in the fundraising dare in aid of a Motor Neurone Disease charity. Supermarkets in Portsmouth, Fareham, and Bursledon, Hampshire, are among the many that have been drained of ice reserves following a flood of sales. Lying empty: This Tesco store in Burlesdon, Southampton, is one of the many to have run out of ice as shoppers rush to take part in the ice bucket challenge. Out of stock: Supermarkets in Portsmouth, Fareham, and Bursledon, Hampshire, are among the many that have been drained of ice reserves following a flood of sales. Tina McDonough, 58, a customer sales assistant at the Co-operative said staff had to turn people 'of all ages' away because they ran out of ice. 'We ran out at the weekend and had to turn a few people away of all ages,' said Ms McDonough, from Portsmouth. 'It was the rainy so nobody was having Pimm's o'clock - it was definitely to do with the Ice Bucket Challenge.' Supermarkets have been ordering in extra supplies of ice to meet the demand, sparked by the campaign going viral on social media. Soaked: Katie Price tries to shield her face from the deluge of water as she takes part. Popular: The challenge has soared in popularity as more celebrities, such as Reese Witherspoon. Splash of the day: Gary Lineker is doused in water for the charity challenge. A spokesman for Tesco in Portsmouth said: 'There has been a massive drive in sales of ice for the store. 'Normally in summer we sell two or three cases a day and in each case there are about six bags. 'But at the moment we're moving 20 cases in a few days. 'A lot of the time it has been young customers buying them to do the ice bucket challenge.' A Tesco branch in South Shields, Tyneside, has also admitted running out of ice. Fun for all ages: Jack Reynolds, 102, from Chesterfield, completes the challenge, dressed in his Union flag boxer shorts. Lady Mary accepts the challenge: Downton's Michelle Dockery has water poured over her head. 'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well,' said Daniel Smith, duty manager of the Simonside Tesco. 'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on. 'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too. 'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.' Tesco has donated the profits from its ice cube sales to charity, and challenged other supermarkets to do the same after selling more than 36 million individual ice cubes over the last week. Far and wide: The ice bucket challenge has even made it to The Simpsons, with Homer taking part. Going global, and beyond: R2D2 gets doused with water on the set of the new Star Wars films. So far the retailer has donated £20,000 to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated competitors Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to follow suit. Tesco community director Greg Sage said: 'The ice bucket challenge has done an amazing job of raising awareness of motor neurone disease. An incredible number of people all over the world have taken part, including a huge number of Tesco colleagues. 'We've seen a big increase in sales of bags of ice as a direct result of this phenomenon, and we want the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association to be the ones to benefit. That's why today we've pledged to donate the extra profits we make to them, and we nominate Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to do the same.' A spokesman from a Sainsbury's branch in Fareham, Hampshire, said sales had doubled from usual hot summer figures as shoppers dashed to buy 'excessive' quantities of ice. Challenge: Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, accepts the Ice Bucket Challenge from Ryanair's Michael O   Leary. Everyone's at it: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is among those who have undertaken the dare. Linda Langdon, the branch's public relations ambassador, said: 'We have been selling excessive amounts of ice and sold 60 bags in one shop in the space of about five hours. 'Compared to normal, it's double the amount we would have sold over the hot summer period.' A spokesman for Morrisons said customers struggling to find ice for their challenges can get a helping hand from the chain's fishmongers. 'Hundreds of our colleagues have also been doing the Ice Bucket Challenge in support of our charity partner, Sue Ryder,' she said. 'They care for people with long term conditions including MND at the end of their lives. So far this year we have raised almost £1m to support their fabulous work across the UK. 'If customers would also like to help by doing their own Ice Bucket Challenge, they don’t need to pay for ice – they can get it for free from our fishmongers, just ask.' Announcement: Actor Chris O'Dowd (left) and his wife Dawn O'Porter (right) used their challenge video to announce they were expecting a baby. The ice bucket challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go. More than £2.7million has been raised for the Motor Neurone Disease Association so far and the figure is rising daily as more people are nominated. Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association, said: 'The ice bucket challenge is an amazing and unprecedented opportunity to raise awareness of what is a devastating terminal disease.' The charity does not have figures on how many people are undertaking the challenge and donating per day, but since August 10 when the charity's ice bucket JustGiving page was set up 546,553 people have donated through the site, an average of more than 30,000 a day, with thousands more using the text number. In the last two weeks, MND Association has also received more than 17,000 new likes on Facebook and 6,000 new followers on Twitter. Cool customer: Singer Kylie Minogue takes part in the ice bucket challenge. On Tuesday the charity website was visited by 153,000 people, compared with the 1,400 who visit on an average day. However, a poll of 1,528 British adults has found that more than half of those who undertook the challenge did not donate to charity. Around half of those quizzed by VoucherCodesPro said they had done the challenge, but 53per cent admitted they had not donated. According to The Independent, more than one in three people said they had taken part solely to get attention on social media, and one in ten said they had only done the challenge as they felt pressure to do so having been nominated. Just 16 per cent said they had given between £1 and £3 to charity, and 3 per cent gave more than £10. 'Maybe not everyone who has done the Ice Bucket Challenge has donated, but a huge number have,' said Douglas Graham, Director of Fundraising for the MND Association. 'Last year in total we received 161,000 donations and in the last week alone we have had more than half a million donations adding up to around £3 million and that’s still rising. 'And while some people will just throw the water over their head we know thousands have come on our website or social media channels and found out about ALS or MND. As a relatively rare disease raising awareness is almost as important as raising funds, so we couldn’t be more pleased.' In the U.S., where the challenge originated, challengers have been urged to support the ALS Association, which supports those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease - a type of motor neurone disease. ALS is used as the umbrella term for the disease in the U.S., whereas in Britain it is MND. Since the end of July, the ALS Association, a sister charity to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, has received 94.3million (around £56.8million) in donations compared to 2.7million (£1.6million) during the same time period last year. A spokesman said: 'These donations have come from existing donors and 2.1 million new donors. 'The ALS Association is tremendously thankful for all of the generous support and awareness that this summer phenomenon has generated for the cause.'

Question: Who is the full size friend and customer, that Franz has to deal with? Movie title: Attack of the Puppet People Movie plot: The film begins with a Brownie troop visiting a doll manufacturing company called Dolls Inc., owned and operated by the seemingly kindly Mr. Franz (John Hoyt). As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished. Although she is concerned about his obsession with his dolls, she reluctantly agrees to take the job. She soon meets a traveling salesman, Bob Westley (John Agar), who introduces himself as the best salesman in St. Louis and immediately sets about attempting to seduce her. Their relationship become serious enough that Bob persuades Sally to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz. The next day however, Franz informs Sally that Bob has gone back home to take care of business and that she should forget him. She, however, is unwilling to accept this and goes to the police with a theory about Franz' role in her boyfriend's disappearance (\\"He made Bob into a doll!\\"), but Sergeant Paterson (Jack Kosslyn) is skeptical. Franz has developed a machine which can shrink people down to a sixth of their original size. He then uses it on anyone who tries to leave him. When he finds that Sally plans to quit, she becomes his latest victim. Franz has already miniaturized at least four other \\"friends\\". They are stored in suspended animation (which he has also invented) in glass jars in a display case in his office. After a reunion between Sally and Bob, Franz reveals how the process works and why he miniaturizes people (it seems that he developed a strong phobia against being alone after his wife left him). Periodically, Franz awakens his captives to enjoy parties he throws for them. During a welcoming party for the two newcomers, Franz has to deal with full-size friend and customer Emil (Michael Mark).

Nancy's father also wants to use this time as a way to stop his daughter's sleuthing as he finds it to be dangerous, and encourage her to focus on high school and living like a normal teenager. But unbeknownst to Carson, Nancy chose their California house because its previous owner, Dehlia Draycott, was a movie star who disappeared for several months before being murdered during a house party and found in her pool. Nancy struggles to fit in at her new school, only befriending a younger boy, Corky (Josh Flitter).

Given the question: Information:  - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft.   - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The PZL.48 Lampart ( Leopard ) was a Polish heavy fighter - bomber design , that remained only a project , owing to the outbreak of World War II.  - A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance. The dedicated light bomber disappeared as fighters, due to advancements in powerplants and aircraft design, were eventually able to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also carrying out other missions and roles.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - A fighter-bomber is a fighter aircraft that has been modified, or used primarily, as a light bomber or attack aircraft. It differs from bomber and attack aircraft primarily in its origins, as a fighter that has been adapted into other roles, whereas bombers and attack aircraft are developed specifically for bombing and attack roles.   - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.

Answer:","output":"The original founder and editor of The Weekly Standard, William Kristol, was born on December 23, 1952."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Q: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head or not. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. For example, why one has to walk could be explained by a car has broken down. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Head: run out of steam<sep>Tail: have exerted physical energy A:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the Head and Tail phrases. Usage: In the phrase 'run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy', \\"run out of steam\\" is the Head and \\"have exerted physical energy\\" is the Tail. This is because they are separated by the \\"<sep>\\" identifier. Part #2: Understanding that participants' specific names are replaced with generic words. Usage: Let's consider the phrase - \\"PersonX is tired<sep>PersonX worked all day\\". Here, PersonX is used as a generic word instead of a specific person. It means that this task can be applied to any person, not just one individual.  Part #3: Recognizing that PersonX is the subject of the event. Usage: In the previous example ('PersonX is tired<sep>PersonX worked all day'), PersonX is the subject of both the Head and the Tail events. They are the central character involved in these events. Part #4: Determining whether the Tail is the reason for the Head Usage: Looking back at our phrase \\"run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy\\", we see that having exerted physical energy (Tail) is indeed a plausible reason for running out of steam (Head). Therefore, in this case, the answer would be \\"Yes\\". Part #5: Understanding a 'reason' as a post-fact explanation or cause. Usage: To further explain the previous example, running out of steam is the event that occurred (post-fact). The cause for this event, as provided by the Tail, is that the person had exerted physical energy.  Part #6: Classifying your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". Usage: In our example (\\"run out of steam<sep>have exerted physical energy\\"), the answer would be classified as \\"Yes\\" because having exerted physical energy can be considered as a reason for running out of steam.  Part #7: Understanding the use of placeholders \\"___\\". Usage: Let's consider the phrase \\"PersonX hugged ___<sep>___ was sad\\". Here \\"___\\" could be another person (like PersonY) or an animal (like a dog). The important aspect here is to know that something was sad and that's why PersonX hugged it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would Others feel as a result?  Possible answers: offended, excited, generous afterwards A:","output":"In the given context, it is likely that the reactions of others in the class may vary, as different people have different preferences and perspectives. However, below are some possibilities based on the three suggested emotions: 1. Offended: Some individuals might feel offended because they could interpret the offer of singing lessons as a judgment on their current singing abilities. They may think that the person signing them up believes they are not good enough and require improvement. 2. Excited: On the other hand, many students might be excited about the opportunity to learn and improve their singing skills. They may view it as a chance to explore a new talent or develop a hobby. The excitement may stem from the prospect of being part of a group activity or simply enjoying the experience of learning something new. 3. Generous afterwards: After participating in the singing lessons, the students might feel grateful for the opportunity they were given and inspired to reciprocate the kindness. This generosity could manifest in various ways, such as the class organizing a group event to show their appreciation or paying the gesture forward by signing someone else up for a class or workshop. Therefore, while it is impossible to predict with certainty how each individual will react, it is possible that some may feel offended, while others may feel excited, and still others might be generous afterwards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The asteroids would cause catastrophic damage, on a city-sized scale or larger. Research from the University of Southhampton has identified the countries most likely to be worst hit. They have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover. Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer has sampled 107 'potentially hazardous' asteroids near Earth - 330ft wide or larger - to make estimates about how many are out there - and the figure is a terrifying 47,000. Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer has sampled 107 'potentially hazardous asteroids' - PHAs - as shown in this diagram illustrating their orbits crossing Earth Findings indicate there are roughly 4,700","output":"potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) with diameters larger than 330 feet (100 meters) that could pose a significant threat to Earth. These PHAs have orbits around the Sun that come within 4.7 million miles (7.5 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit and pose a potential risk of impacting our planet. The estimated number of 47,000 potentially hazardous asteroids mentioned in the question refers to the overall number of near-Earth asteroids, which includes both larger and smaller objects. The countries most likely to be worst hit by an asteroid impact are those with a large population and high infrastructure density, and those situated in vulnerable geographic locations. Based on these factors, countries such as the United States, China, India, Japan, and countries in Europe are at a higher risk of catastrophic damage and loss of life from an asteroid impact. The immediate effects of an asteroid impact would depend on the size, composition, and speed of the asteroid, as well as the location of the impact on Earth. An asteroid impact on a city-sized scale could result in: 1. Immediate destruction of buildings and infrastructure: The force of the impact would cause buildings to collapse, roads to be destroyed, and essential services like power, water, and sewage systems to be rendered inoperable. The affected area could extend for many miles beyond the impact site. 2. Shockwave and blast wave: The impact of an asteroid would generate an immense shockwave and blast wave, traveling through the air and ground. These waves could cause further destruction by shattering windows, knocking down walls, and toppling trees, potentially extending damage far beyond the initial impact site. 3. Fireball and subsequent fires: The intense heat generated by the impact would create a massive fireball, igniting fires in the surrounding area. These fires could merge, creating a massive firestorm that consumes everything in its path and releases large amounts of smoke and ash into the atmosphere. 4. Tidal waves or tsunamis: If the asteroid impact occurred in or near a body of water, it could generate enormous waves, flooding coastal areas and causing significant damage to life and property. Long-term consequences of an asteroid impact could include: 1. Disruption of food supplies: The destruction of agricultural land, fisheries, and transportation infrastructure would disrupt food supplies, leading to food shortages and potential famine. 2. Economic collapse: The massive loss of life, infrastructure, and resources would have dire consequences for the global economy, leading to widespread unemployment, economic recession, and potential collapse. 3. Climate change: The release of vast amounts of dust and debris into the atmosphere could lead to significant climate change, with potential effects such as reduced sunlight, lower temperatures, and disrupted weather patterns. 4. Disease and poor sanitation: The destruction of healthcare and sanitation infrastructure, along with the displacement of large populations, could lead to the spread of disease and poor public health conditions. To mitigate these potential catastrophic effects, international cooperation and initiatives are essential. Governments and space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have established programs to track and monitor near-Earth objects and develop technologies and strategies for asteroid impact prevention, such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA). Public awareness and preparedness are also crucial, as well as investment in research, development, and infrastructure to minimize human and economic losses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - opening one's mouth - listening - translator - voice - language  The answer is \\"language\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"language\\" because language is an essential tool for communication and the foundation for effective conversations between two people. It goes beyond simply opening one's mouth or using a voice; language allows both parties to understand one another, share thoughts, feelings, and ideas, and to build connections and relationships. Let us explore the relevance and importance of language with regards to each aspect mentioned in the options: 1. Opening one's mouth: While opening one's mouth is vital for speaking, it does not guarantee effective communication if two people do not share a common language. Being able to pronounce words and speak aloud is only a small aspect of conversing, as understanding and comprehension are crucial for genuine dialogue. This can only be achieved if the individuals are familiar with the language being spoken. 2. Listening: Active listening is undoubtedly an integral part of effective communication. However, without a shared language, one may only hear sounds and words without truly grasping the meaning or intent behind them. The language barrier can turn an otherwise engaging conversation into a confusing or frustrating experience. 3. Translator: A translator can indeed help two people communicate effectively if they do not share a common language. BUT, relying on a translator might not convey the original meaning accurately and may hinder one's ability to express themselves fluently and spontaneously. While translators can bridge some gaps, they cannot replace the authenticity and connection brought about by communicating directly in a common language. 4. Voice: The human voice brings emotions and tone into conversations, adding depth to the words being spoken. However, similar to opening one's mouth, having a voice alone cannot guarantee effective communication. It is essential to be able to express oneself using the right words, phrases, and sentences in a language that both parties understand. The content and meaning of the conversation rely on the language used. 5. Language: Language serves as a medium and platform for communication between people. It consists of a structured system of words, phrases, grammar rules, and pronunciation, enabling individuals to convey their thoughts, emotions, and intentions with clarity. Two people need to know and understand a shared language to engage in meaningful and effective conversations. The understanding of cultural context, idiomatic expressions, and the nuances of that language further enhances the effectiveness of the communication. In conclusion, knowing a shared language is essential for two people to talk to each other effectively. It allows them to understand one another clearly, engage in constructive exchanges, and establish connections that go beyond simple verbal expressions. Language enables effective communication by providing the structure to express thoughts, feelings, and ideas and fostering understanding, empathy, and rapport between people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young.

Premise: \\"Fortunately, much of what you'll want to see is accessible through your car window, because you'll likely be spending a lot of time driving from one site to another.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Sightseeing has to be done on foot as there are no roads.\\" Step 2: Analyze the premise for relevant information about the hypothesis. The premise states that sightseeing can be done from the car window, which implies that driving plays a significant role in visiting different sites. This further implies the presence of roads that facilitate the use of cars for sightseeing. Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that sightseeing has to be done on foot because there are no roads. This statement conflicts with the premise, as the premise highlights the use of cars for sightseeing, which requires roads. Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the comparison. Since the premise goes against the hypothesis by asserting that sightseeing is done through a car window while driving from site to site, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Which topic is this article about? Choose from: [I] World [II] Sports [III] Business [IV] Science/Tech","output":"[III] Business This article is about Business, particularly focusing on the corporate culture, internal communication, and employee bonding in the context of Michael Ovitz's tenure at Disney. The media giant Disney operates in the realm of entertainment, business, and media industry, making it a significant topic in the corporate world. The issue of Ovitz's \\"wacky ideas\\" for employee bonding demonstrates how critical leadership style and team dynamics can be in a large business environment like Disney. Michael Ovitz, a well-known personality in the business world, rose to prominence with his talent management company, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which he co-founded. His transition to Disney, however, reportedly did not go as smoothly according to a former executive. This creates the opportunity to discuss the importance of effective communication, company culture, and management ideologies within a business organization. One of Disney's core tenets is prioritizing its employees. As a result, the bonding activities and team-building experiences proposed by leaders like Michael Ovitz are vital for fostering a sense of unity and belonging among employees. Achieving this balance is crucial for the company's overall success and growth. However, the \\"wacky ideas\\" proposed by Ovitz potentially clashed with both the existing corporate norms and the expectations of Disney's employees. The allegation that Ovitz was unable to fit in at the company serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of aligning leadership values with company values and mission, all the more relevant in the world of business. Moreover, this article illuminates the challenges leaders might face when transitioning to a new company with a distinct culture and legacy, like Disney. It highlights the importance of adapting one's leadership style in sync with the values and demands of the new organization, as well as the implications this may have on both employee satisfaction and the overall success of a business. In summary, this article deals with the business domain, focusing on the aspects of leadership, corporate culture, and employee relations within the context of Michael Ovitz's time at Disney. The challenges that arise when an influential figure like Ovitz struggles to integrate with an established corporate culture underpin the broader theme of effective management and its impact on a company's performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ .  Now, I have a new situation: Two colleagues gave blood for an emergency. Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected.  Answer this question please: Which colleague didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk? A:","output":"In the given situation, it is mentioned that Ned got infected with HIV due to the reuse of a needle, while his friend Nate did not get infected.

Translate the following sentence to Finnish: The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority.","output":"Komission pitäisi olla hajautettu, jotta henkilöstö voisi käyttää vastuuta ja valtaa.  In Finnish:  Komission = The Commission Pitäisi olla = Should be Hajautettu = Decentralised  Jotta = In order to Henkilöstö = Staff Voisi = Could  Käyttää = Exercise  Vastuuta ja valtaa = Responsibility and authority So, the complete translation of \\"The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority.\\" is \\"Komission pitäisi olla hajautettu, jotta henkilöstö voisi käyttää vastuuta ja valtaa.\\" As Finnish is an agglutinative language, where words may have multiple morphemes indicating grammatical relationships, the sentence structure can appear different from English. Also, Finnish word order is flexible, primarily used for emphasis rather than for determining the meaning of the sentence. However, in this specific sentence, the word order closely matches the English original.  In this translation: - \\"Komission\\" is a straightforward translation of \\"the Commission\\". - \\"Pitäisi olla\\" translates as \\"should be\\", indicating a suggestion or recommendation. - \\"Hajautettu\\", means \\"decentralised\\", referring to a distribution of functions or powers away from a central location or authority. - \\"Jotta\\" is a conjunction that translates as \\"in order to\\", indicating the purpose of decentralising the Commission. - \\"Henkilöstö\\" is a direct translation for \\"staff\\", referring to the group of people who work for the Commission. - \\"Voisi\\" is the conditional form of the verb \\"voida\\" (can), meaning \\"could\\". - \\"Käyttää\\" means \\"to exercise\\", in the sense of employing or applying something, in this case responsibility and authority. - \\"Vastuuta\\" and \\"valtaa\\" are the partitive forms of the nouns \\"vastuu\\" (responsibility) and \\"valta\\" (authority).

The hypothesis suggests that \\"more people are asserting their rights as individuals rather than as groups.\\" This means that a growing number of people are championing their rights at a personal level, as opposed to being part of a larger group advocating for their shared rights. Step 2: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and hypothesis highlight the idea that there is a shift in the way people are asserting their rights – moving from collective efforts to individual actions. The premise is based on an observation, and the hypothesis is a statement that seems to be in line with the observation. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis The premise that individual people are speaking out for their rights more than massing together supports the hypothesis that more people are asserting their rights individually rather than as part of a group. The premise implies a growing trend of individual action, which corresponds to the hypothesis. Step 4: Conclusion Given the premise that more people are speaking out for their own rights and not joining larger groups, it can be concluded that this premise does entail the hypothesis that more people are asserting their rights as individuals rather than as groups.

Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection.

The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.

What is the answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? from the following article ?  In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \\"own spiritual ancestors\\" and because the sites were once...

The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called \\"a genius driven by emotion\\".

Summarize: The governor of Homs province, Talal Barazi, said government forces were now regrouping outside the ancient city, preparing to launch a fresh assault. IS held the city from May 2015 until it was forced out in March this year. Correspondents say IS appears to have taken advantage of the government's focus on Aleppo, further north. Mr Barazi confirmed the withdrawal from Palmyra but insisted \\"the army is using all means to prevent the terrorists from staying\\". Activists in the city said militants were going door to door looking for any remaining forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. IS re-entered the city and its nearby ancient ruins - a Unesco World Heritage site - on Saturday, after launching an offensive earlier in the week. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday morning that \\"intense\\" bombing from Russian planes had forced IS to withdraw to the orchards on the city's outskirts. The Russian defence ministry said it had carried out 64 strikes during the operation, and claimed to have killed more than 300 militants. The Syrian army has also sent reinforcements to the city, reportedly diverting troops from Aleppo. The observatory later reported that militants had again fought their way into the town, forcing government forces to retreat to the south. Reports said IS militants had attacked with suicide car bombs and artillery. Palmyra is seen as strategic for IS because it lies close to oilfields. IS destroyed a number of monuments and beheaded the archaeological director during its 10-month occupation of the site and the adjacent city of Tadmur. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. Maamoun Abdulkarim, a Syrian official for antiquities, said the contents of Palmyra's museum had been transferred to Damascus but he feared for the safety of the ancient ruins. \\"I fear they will be more vengeful,\\" he told the Associated Press. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous. The latest battle in Palmyra happened as the Syrian army closed in on the remaining rebel-held area of the city of Aleppo. Rebel forces said on Saturday that they had halted the advance of government forces in the pockets they still control in Aleppo. One rebel commander said a reason for the slowed government advance could be the redeployment of troops to Palmyra. However, the Syrian government has been continuously advancing on the rebel areas, backed by Russian air support, and now reportedly controls 93% of the city. A rebel official told Reuters news agency that his forces faced \\"death or surrender\\" as their area of control continued to shrink. On Saturday, US Secretary of State John Kerry called on the Syrian government and the Russian military to \\"show a little grace\\" as they mopped up the remaining rebel-held areas of Aleppo. US and Russian officials are continuing talks in Geneva over the possible evacuation of civilians and rebel fighters from Aleppo, but analysts say an agreement looks unlikely. Summary:","output":"ISIS militants have re-entered the ancient city of Palmyra, with government forces regrouping outside, preparing for another assault. It is suggested that ISIS took advantage of the government's focus on Aleppo, further north. When the group had held the city from May 2015 to March 2016, they destroyed numerous monuments and beheaded the archaeological director.

Each new season brings its own records and achievements, and the competition amongst quarterbacks is fierce. Nevertheless, it is essential to pay homage to the incredible accomplishments of those who have etched their names in the annals of NFL history. One such performance is the fourth longest touchdown pass, a remarkable display of skill and precision on the field. In this article, we will unveil the player responsible for this exceptional play and delve into the significance of this seemingly unsurpassable achievement. Unveiling the Fourth Longest Touchdown Pass Thrower The player we are celebrating in this article is none other than Patrick Mahomes II, the star quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes made history by throwing the fourth longest touchdown pass in NFL history on September 23rd, 2018. This jaw-dropping performance occurred during a game against the San Francisco 49ers, when Mahomes threw a staggering 89-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demarcus Robinson. Mahomes' Impressive Career and Early Life Patrick Mahomes II, born September 17th, 1995, in Tyler, Texas, is the son of former Major League Baseball player Pat Mahomes. Patrick's innate talent in sports was evident from a young age, as he excelled in multiple sports, including football, basketball, and baseball. Ultimately, Mahomes decided to focus on football and, after a stellar high school career and a successful tenure at Texas Tech University, entered the NFL for the 2017 season as the 10th overall draft pick by the Kansas City Chiefs.  Mahomes' rise to fame has been incredibly rapid, yet well-deserved, as he has displayed exceptional talent and skill in the quarterback position. Within his first few years in the league, he became the youngest quarterback to reach 10,000 passing yards, a Super Bowl MVP, and a Pro Bowler. These accolades, along with many others, have solidified Mahomes' status as one of the most formidable talents in the NFL today. The Significance of the Fourth Longest Touchdown Pass in NFL History The fourth longest touchdown pass is an exceptional achievement that speaks volumes about the skill, precision, and power required from a quarterback. To complete an 89-yard pass with such accuracy is a testament to Mahomes' arm strength and intimate understanding of the game. Touchdown passes like this one showcase the perfect synergy between the quarterback and the receiver, a connection that takes years to develop, refine, and execute to perfection. While the record for the longest touchdown pass remains a remarkable feat in its own right, the fourth longest pass demonstrates consistency and potential for even greater accomplishments in the future. Mahomes' achievement emphasizes the importance of continued growth and development in the sport, challenging both current and future players to reach new heights and redefine what is possible on the field. Conclusion Patrick Mahomes II's 89-yard touchdown pass against the San Francisco 49ers in 2018 stands as the fourth longest touchdown pass in NFL history. This impressive accomplishment adds to the growing list of Mahomes' accolades and immortalizes his name among the NFL's elite quarterbacks. As the NFL continues to evolve and its players improve and develop, milestones such as these remind us of the incredible dedication, talent, and skill required to perform at the highest level.

During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.  - The Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices was awarded from 1977 to 1986. From 1977 to 1981 it was called the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement for Voices. The award is presented to the arranger of the music.  - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings...

It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. The term \\"a cappella\\" was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music. The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.  - Janis Siegel (born July 23, 1952) is an American jazz singer with the vocal group The Manhattan Transfer.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

Q: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. China's landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions,\\" the Pentagon statement said. \\"We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,\\" the statement added. \\"We believe these recent deployments and the continued... Question: After the end of the text, how will the public view of China's military change? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"The public view of China's military is likely to experience a shift as a result of their exclusion from the international maritime exercise and their activities in the South China Sea. However, the extent and nature of this change will vary among different groups and individuals, depending on their stance on the issues encompassing regional security, international relations, and geopolitical concerns. For those who perceive China's militarization of disputed territories in the South China Sea as a threat to regional stability, the exclusion from the RIMPAC exercise and the Pentagon's statement on China's actions further reinforces a negative view of China's military. These individuals may see China as increasingly aggressive, expansionist, and unwilling to cooperate with international norms and dispute resolution mechanisms. As a result, this group will likely advocate for stronger actions to counter China's assertiveness and restore a perceived balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, some people may view China's exclusion from the international maritime exercise as an unnecessary provocation by the United States, further straining already fragile U.S.-China relations. This group may see the U.S. move as an attempt to isolate and contain China, while undermining regional peace and stability. They may argue that by excluding China from the RIMPAC exercise, the U.S. is not promoting cooperation and dialogue, but instead perpetuating a negative cycle of competitive behavior in the region. Additionally, there are those who interpret this event as a clear signal of shifting geopolitical dynamics that may require further ongoing assessment. They may advocate for a balanced approach that recognizes the potential threats posed by China's growing military capabilities, while also emphasizing the necessity of engaging in diplomatic efforts to promote regional stability and cooperation. In conclusion, the public view of China's military is likely to change as a result of the events described, with differing perspectives arising from various concerns and priorities. Some may view China as a growing threat to be countered, others may see the U.S. measures as further escalating tensions, and still, others may take a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the evolving geopolitical landscape. Ultimately, the changes in public perception of China's military will depend on the shifting balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region, the outcome of diplomatic efforts, and the ability of relevant parties to effectively manage and resolve their differences in the interest of regional peace and stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sleep more.\\"","output":"Title: The Comprehensive Guide to a Healthy Lifestyle: Eating, Vitamins, Hydration, Exercise, and Sleep Introduction In the race of life, staying healthy and fit is of utmost importance. A balanced lifestyle with proper nutrition, hydration, exercise, and sleep is the key to achieving this goal. However, it often seems that our lives are ruled by an endless list of tasks and responsibilities that can make sticking to healthy habits quite challenging. This article aims to break down each vital component of a healthy lifestyle, guiding you on the path towards better overall well-being. 1. Eat five to nine servings of vegetables per day Various studies have reiterated the importance of incorporating a healthy serving of vegetables into your daily diet. Vegetables are a rich source of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that boost your immune system, help maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.  To ensure you are getting enough vegetables each day, try the following tips: - Include a variety of vegetables in your daily meals to gain maximum benefits - Begin your day with a vegetable-packed smoothie or incorporate greens into your breakfast - Choose vegetable-based snacks, like carrot sticks with hummus or cucumbers with Greek yogurt - Add extra vegetables to your main meals like salads, stir-fries, and soups 2. Eat lean proteins Lean proteins provide essential amino acids that support muscle growth and repair, regulate appetite, and boost energy levels. They are also known to improve cardiovascular health, decrease obesity, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Some excellent sources of lean proteins include poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, and low-fat dairy products. Here are a few ways to include lean proteins in your daily meals: - Plan your meals around a lean protein source, such as grilled chicken, fish, or tofu - Replace processed meat in sandwiches or wraps with natural, lean protein options - Add beans or legumes to salads and soups for a low-fat, high-protein alternative 3. Consider a multivitamin supplement with vitamin B12 and folate While a well-balanced diet should provide all the necessary nutrients, it's not always possible to get everything we need through food alone. In such cases, a multivitamin supplement containing essential vitamins like B12 and folate could play a beneficial role. These vitamins are significant for maintaining healthy nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation and choose a high-quality supplement from a reputable source. 4. Drink more water Proper hydration is a crucial aspect of overall health. Adequate water intake helps regulate body temperature, transport nutrients, and remove waste products. It also plays a role in cognitive function, digestion, and heart health. Here are a few tips to stay well-hydrated throughout the day: - Carry a reusable water bottle with you at all times - Set reminders on your phone or use an app to track your water intake - Replace sugary drinks with water, herbal tea, or sugar-free alternatives 5. Reduce your activity level While exercise is essential for our physical and mental well-being, over-exercising can lead to exhaustion, injury, and weaken immune function. Rather than pushing yourself excessively, follow a balanced approach that includes low-impact workouts such as walking, swimming, yoga, or pilates, combined with more vigorous activities like running or strength training. Adequate rest days are also necessary for your body to recover. 6. Sleep more Sleep is a restorative process crucial for memory consolidation, immune system function, and metabolic regulation. Adults generally need between seven to nine hours of sleep each night to reap maximum benefits.  Here are some tips to improve your sleep quality: - Establish a regular sleep schedule and stick to it, even on weekends - Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation - Reduce exposure to screens before bedtime to avoid the harmful effects of blue light on sleep - Make your sleep environment comfortable, dark, and quiet Conclusion The journey to a healthy lifestyle does not have to be arduous. By incorporating the guidelines mentioned above, you can take small but impactful steps towards better nutrition, hydration, exercise, and sleep routines. Remember, the key is consistency. Stay committed to your health goals, and soon these habits will transform into lasting lifestyle changes with visible benefits to your overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Surrounded by willows and ragged spruces, the conical tepees rose in the plain beneath, but Blake stopped abruptly as he caught sight of them.

Plot title: Twister Movie plot: In June 1969, 5-year-old Jo Thornton (Alexa Vega), her parents, and the family dog Toby seek shelter in their family storm cellar as a powerful F5 tornado hits their farm in Oklahoma. This tornado is so strong that the storm cellar door is ripped off, causing Jo's father (Richard Lineback) to be pulled into the storm to his death. Jo, her mother (Rusty Schwimmer), and Toby survive. 27 years later in 1996, 32-year-old Jo (Helen Hunt), now a meteorologist, is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Harding (Bill Paxton), a former weather researcher and storm chaser, who has since become a weather reporter. He is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz). They need Jo's signature on the divorce papers and have tracked her down during an active bout of stormy weather. Jo has built four identical tornado research devices called DOROTHY, based on Bill's designs. The device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure from the inside, with the purpose of creating a more advanced storm warning system. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her team of storm chasers, and the team encounters Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), a smug, corporate-funded meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has created a device based on DOROTHY, called DOT-3, he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. During the first tornado, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both destroyed (the truck is picked up and lands upside-down). They continue storm chasing in Bill's truck, with Melissa in the back seat. They find a second tornado, a confirmed F2, and head off on a back road when the twister shifts its track. They soon find themselves driving through heavy rain, and instead collide with a cluster of two violent waterspouts, one of which splits, spinning them around on the highway until the waterspouts dissipate. They're fine, but Melissa becomes hysterical from the ordeal, and Bill has to calm her down. The team... My question: WHAT FILM IS SHOWING AT THE DRIVE-IN WHEN THE F4 TORNADO HITS?

In a decision filed Thursday by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., a three-judge panel declared the U.S. Forest Service \\"abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources\\" when it issued permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to build through parts of the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests and a right of way across the Appalachian Trail.      \\"This conclusion,\\" they wrote in a unanimous judgment, \\"is particularly informed by the Forest Service's serious environmental concerns that were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company's deadlines.\\"      The judges cited Dr. Seuss' The Lorax: \\"We trust the United States Forest Service to 'speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.'\\"      The court concluded that the Forest Service's decisions violated both the National Forest Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and found the Forest Service lacked the authority to grant the pipeline a right of way across the Appalachian Trail.      The Atlantic Coast Pipeline would originate in West Virginia and stretch across Virginia and North Carolina (here's a map). As the judges detail, the project would make a considerable impact on the landscape:      \\"Construction would involve clearing trees and other vegetation from a 125-foot right of way (reduced to 75 feet in wetlands) through the national forests, digging a trench to bury the pipeline, and blasting and flattening ridgelines in mountainous terrains. Following construction, the project requires maintaining a 50-foot right of way (reduced to 30 feet in wetlands) through the [two national forests] for the life of the pipeline.\\"      They note that in 2015, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to conduct an environmental impact statement on the project, the Forest Service noted concerns about landslides and slope failures, as well as impact on groundwater, soil, and endangered species. A draft of FERC's environmental impact statement stated that the pipeline route was designed to go through national forest lands rather than National Park Service lands, as the latter which would likely necessitate congressional approval.      The Southern Environmental Law Center was one of the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit challenging the Forest Service's issuance of the permits.      \\"I think what happened here is for years the Forest Service was asking tough questions about this project and requesting additional information and it turned on a dime when the Trump administration came into power,\\" Patrick Hunter, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, told West Virginia Public Broadcasting. \\"Federal agencies can change their minds, but they have to [have] good reasons for doing it and they didn't have a good reason to change their mind and turn on a dime like this and I think that came through in this decision-making.\\"      \\"The pipeline route that Dominion has chosen cannot be approved as of right now, and so if they want to keep working on this thing, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board,\\" Hunter told the broadcaster. \\"All of the agencies that have to issue approvals for this pipeline — their approvals depend on this one pipeline route. And since that can no longer be built as planned, I think that calls all of those other approvals into question.\\"      Dominion Energy, the pipeline's lead developer, said it will appeal immediately to the full appeals court.      \\"If allowed to stand, this decision will severely harm consumers and do great damage to our economy and energy security,\\" Aaron Ruby, a spokesman for Dominion Energy, said in a statement to NPR. \\"Public utilities are depending on this infrastructure to meet the basic energy needs of millions of people and businesses in our region.\\"      According to Ruby, 56 other oil and gas pipelines already cross the Appalachian Trail — a few of them more than once.      Natural gas pipelines are buried. From ground level, hikers would see a marker (like this one) alerting them to the pipeline under their boots, and a gap where the trees had been clear-cut. No trees are permitted to grow over top of a pipeline, because their roots can damage it.      The Forest Service said in an emailed statement that it \\"will review the information received from the court opinion about the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and will be looking at our options before taking any action.\\"      As the Richmond Times-Dispatch notes, the environmental concerns are serious: \\"The panel said the Forest Service's 'insufficient analysis of landslide risks' also became clear when the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline, cited by FERC as an example of an existing pipeline built across sensitive terrain in the Appalachian Mountains, ruptured and exploded in early July after a landslide in West Virginia.\\"      Last week, following another order by the 4th Circuit, Dominion voluntarily suspended work on the project while it addresses issues with its permits. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A court decided that a company, called the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, can't build a big pipe for natural gas across two forests and a trail. The court said the U.S. Forest Service made a mistake by giving permission for the pipe. The pipe was going to start in West Virginia and go across Virginia and North Carolina. Building the pipe would need to clear lots of trees and dig a big trench. The court listened to how this construction could cause landslides and hurt the environment. The company that wants to build the pipeline said they will try to get permission again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me just start by saying that I had completely virgin hair. I had NEVER dyed it before in my life. I went here because my mother claimed it was a great place. It was very posh. They served me iced tea in a wine glass. I just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists.   Wendy, was younger than I was, and had an attitude with me from the start. I told her that I wanted to go light blonde (think lady gaga or christina aguilera). I'm a natural brunette. She instantly told me that it would look terrible and that she refused to do it. Then she continued to have every single stylist in the place back her up and tell me how stupid I was for wanting it. Finally she said she would do me a few shades lighter and since my mother suggested her, I decided to just go with it. Instead of making me a few shades lighter she proceeded to give me orange and yellow streaks in my dark brown hair.  Halfway through she started cutting and styling another womans hair (even though I had an appointment and she didn't.) I had to sit for about an hour reading (not under a dryer) while she finished up the other woman. By the time she was done with me I was devastated. She asked me what was wrong and i said \\"Well it's not blonde enough and I don't really like highlights. I told you this.\\" She took a piece of the yellow she made and said,  \\"THIS ISNT BLONDE TO YOU? ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS ISNT BLONDE!?\\"  Then took me around the entire salon and had every stylist tell me that it looked amazing and I was a \\"hot blonde\\". Every single stylist then told me how horrible what I wanted would have looked and that I should be thankful that Wendy did what she wanted instead of listening to me.  I felt horribly bullied and left there 200 dollars poorer and covered in embarrassing orange and yellow stripes. I spent weeks wearings hats and headbands to cover up the horrible mistake.   It wasn't just the bad hair job, because I could have understood that. But it was the fact that she insulted me and bullied me the entire time and then proceeded to give me the opposite of what I asked for. Why didn't she just tell me from the beginning that she couldn't help me? It would have saved me the 400+ that it cost to correct the mistake she made.

Summarize this article: Sean McConville's corner was not cleared and, in a goalmouth melee, Kee scrambled home his third goal of the campaign two minutes into added time to seal a 2-1 victory for the hosts. Stanley opened the scoring after 10 minutes when Kayden Jackson got the ball in the box from Janoi Donacien, turned and slotted it low into the far corner of the net. It was former Barnsley frontman Jackson's fourth goal in three league games. Mansfield equalised after 25 minutes when Danny Rose flicked the ball over keeper Aaron Chapman and it fell to Lee Angol, who had the easy task of firing into an empty net for his first Stags goal. It was a fiery first half with Paul Digby and Zander Diamond both off-target for Mansfield, while Omar Beckles headed wide for Stanley. After the break, both sides had chances to win it with Mansfield's Krystian Pearce heading wide from a corner while, at the other end, Mark Hughes headed over and Jackson had a goalbound shot blocked before Kee popped up with the winner.

When you look up in the sky and see the sun which planet would the sun appear larger? (A) Mercury (B) Earth  Choose the answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Earth\\". Answer:","output":"The correct answer is \\"Mercury.\\" To understand why, we need to consider the distance between each planet and the Sun, as well as their relative positions in the solar system. The sun's apparent size in the sky is determined by its angular diameter, which depends on its actual diameter and its distance from the observer. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with an average distance of approximately 57.91 million kilometers (35.98 million miles). Earth, on the other hand, is located at an average distance of about 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the Sun. This difference in distance means that Mercury is about 2.6 times closer to the Sun than Earth. When you observe the Sun from Mercury, its apparent size would be larger due to the closer proximity. The angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Mercury is roughly 3.2 times larger than as seen from Earth. The formula to calculate the angular diameter is: Angular Diameter = (Actual Diameter / Distance) × (180 / Pi) Using this formula, the angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Mercury would be: Angular Diameter = (1.391 million km / 57.91 million km) × (180 / 3.14159) ≈ 1.377 degrees And the Sun's angular diameter as seen from Earth would be: Angular Diameter = (1.391 million km / 149.6 million km) × (180 / 3.14159) ≈ 0.533 degrees Since 1.377 degrees is larger than 0.533 degrees, the Sun would appear larger when viewed from Mercury as compared to Earth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Could the Scottish Parliament stop the UK from leaving the EU? To recap. The Prime Minister has resigned. The leader of the opposition is resisting pressure from senior colleagues to follow suit. And, lest we forget in this temporary focus upon party leadership, the people of the United Kingdom have voted to leave the European Union after 43 years of membership. In these unprecedented circumstances, it is understandable that there is a degree of uncertainty in the immediate response to events. That disquiet includes Scotland where the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is seeking to draft a distinct reaction within the distinctive Scottish body politic. She has said that the people of Scotland have voted, clearly, to continue in membership of the European Union, with its attendant rights and responsibilities. It is her duty, she argues, to attempt to carry out that popular instruction. First things first. Is there such a mandate? Ms Sturgeon says yes. She says Scotland is a nation - although not presently a state. She is the elected political leader of that nation, constrained by that office to follow the wishes of her voters. How would you expect her, as a Nationalist, to say anything else? It is the fundamental creed of her cause that Scotland is distinct and merits distinctive treatment, within the limits of shared sovereignty and co-operation which characterise the modern SNP. Others of a Unionist persuasion say no. The Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, for example says that Scotland remained within the Union via the referendum of September 2014 - and that Scotland, consequently, is bound by UK collective decisions such as the vote on Thursday. Nigel Farage and David Coburn of UKIP put it more bluntly, in their customary fashion. They dismiss utterly Ms Sturgeon's elemental pitch. It was notable, however, that David Cameron stressed the involvement of the Scottish government and other devolved administrations in the EU negotiations to come. Boris Johnson, he who agitated for Leave, seemed almost plaintive when he said there was no reason why Brexit should cause any disturbance in the domestic Union. These, however, are differences of tone. Although such things matter, no Unionist will readily accept that Scotland should do anything other than submit to the declared will of the UK, as expressed in the vote on Thursday. That is, unless and until Scotland is an independent state. So what can Nicola Sturgeon do? She has said she will examine all options in consort with the European institutions and others to seek to secure continuing links with the EU for Scotland. One of those options would be a second independence referendum - in order to allow Scotland to join/rejoin the EU in her own right, as a sovereign state. But what about those other options? In particular, what about the suggestion that Ms Sturgeon might encourage the Scottish Parliament to seek to exercise a veto over the implementation of Brexit? This scenario is based upon an interpretation of the Scotland Act 1998, the statute which created (or, rather, recreated) the Scottish Parliament. Clause 29 of that Act, anent legislative competence, empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in the devolved areas for which it is responsible - while obliging it to take care that nothing it does is \\"incompatible\\" with EU law. In short, EU law has force in Scotland and, in devolved areas, is enacted and implemented by the Scottish Parliament, not Westminster. That has led constitutional experts, such as Sir David Edward to suggest that the consent of the Scottish Parliament would be required were it to be suggested that the UK's relationship with the EU, in legislation and other areas, might be altered. Sir David made this point in evidence to a House of Lords inquiry. Their Lordships report cited Sir David as envisaging that there might be \\"certain political advantages\\" to be drawn from withholding consent. Which is true. It is further true that it is an established Convention (formerly known as the Sewel Convention) that the Westminster Parliament should not interfere in devolved areas without the consent of Holyrood. Such agreement is customarily given via a legislative consent motion, LCM, at Holyrood. So does that mean Holyrood has a veto over Brexit? Up to a point, Lord Copper. Firstly, one should understand that relations with the EU have a long and complex history, in the context of the demands for self-government. A seat at the EU top table has long been a prize sought after by supporters of independence. Even those who backed devolution, rather than full independence, foresaw that Scotland would develop her own relations with the EU, in consort with the UK. Thus the White Paper of 1997 which led to the 1998 Act fudged the issue. It said that dealing with the EU was a matter for Westminster, alongside foreign affairs. But it suggested that the UK government would seek to consult the devolved administration in Scotland and take account of its views. Let us turn now to statute. The 1998 Act proceeds by specifying the issues which are reserved to Westminster - then grandly declaring that everything else is devolved. In that single little line is the subordinate nature of devolution. Generally, Westminster will let the Scottish Parliament get on with devolved legislation. Carry on governing. But it is also made clear that Westminster's ultimate sovereignty over the UK, the entire UK, is unaffected. So it could be argued - it is already being argued - that, if it came to a constitutional battle, Westminster would have the final say. Holyrood might withhold consent for the legislative moves to implement Brexit. Westminster might note such a verdict, no doubt with polite gratitude - then proceed to implement Brexit, exercising its over-riding sovereignty. Would that be wise? Would it be politically smart? Those are different questions, to discuss should this issue arise for real. To be clear, Nicola Sturgeon is not personally making a big deal of this. She is not issuing scatter-gun threats. She is attempting to remain calm, adopting the persona of one of the few serving leaders in these islands not resigning or under pressure to resign. To be clear, further, she did not float the issue of a \\"veto\\" on Friday in her formal response. It emerged today in reply to decidedly adept questioning from my estimable colleague, Gordon Brewer. Just as with the tone adopted by David Cameron and Boris Johnson, I think Ms Sturgeons' demeanour is significant. She is seeking to make slow, steady progress. In particular, she is not anxious to drive forward to an instant referendum on independence. Why not? Because she fears she might lose it. The big challenges she faced in September 2014 were: the economy, the currency and membership of the EU. The third factor has now altered somewhat, positing the prospect of indyref2. However, items one and two remain. What would independence do to the economy? What currency would an independent Scotland use? Further, still, it is possible that Brexit might encourage furious Scots - and many are decidedly angry - to move in greater numbers towards independence. Equally, it might make some think that the constitutional world is already scary and uncertain enough without revisiting the prospect of independence at this stage. Ms Sturgeon, as she has made amply plain, wants more evidence that the people of Scotland are ready this time round to back independence. So she wants time. She needs time. Hence, partly, the search for alternatives. The search for any means by which Scotland can maintain EU links. To be clear again, this is a genuine, governmental search. Ms Sturgeon is not bluffing or deploying guile. She, authentically, wants ideas as to how to proceed. Equally, however, she acknowledges that it may well be the case that there is nothing short of member state status which replicates, for Scotland, the EU links currently provided via the UK. She has not specified options - but let us speculate. What might be possible? Could Scotland gain a distinctive status as, in reverse, is the case with Greenland and the Faroes which are parts of the Kingdom of Denmark, yet not in membership of the EU? Well, maybe, although Scotland is decidedly different. The Scottish government are seeking to retain membership, once the member state of which they are part has left. Secondly, Scotland is an intrinsic part of the UK economy and the UK's treaty obligations. It might be thought difficult to disentangle Scotland's rights and obligations from the wider UK. It is possible to envisage a situation where distinctive status within Brexit is afforded to, say, Gibraltar. Scotland may be trickier. However, as one senior member of the UK Government said to me, Europe is all about the politics. The constitutionally impossible suddenly becomes feasible if the EU's leaders want it and need it. But would they? Politically, would they? It seems probable that the old objections would arise. That member states like Spain and Belgium would not want to encourage special status for Scotland which might, in very different circumstances, be demanded by their own autonomous provinces. Then what about associate membership status for Scotland, which has been floated? It is not clear what that would mean. How, for example, could rights and responsibility be accorded to Scotland without drafting new treaties which applied to Scotland alone? How would that fit with the removal of treaties affecting the UK? How could Scotland, for example, access the single market and retain freedom of movement for workers while remaining part of a political entity, the UK, which has withdrawn from those elements? I do not know. And, more importantly, Nicola Sturgeon does not know either, at this stage. To repeat, she is genuinely seeking answers. But, tactically, she is also buying time if it becomes evident that the only route to be pursued is that of independence via a second referendum. And now, the epilogue. Today Dr Russell Barr, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, has issued a prayer, to be used, if they so choose, by the Kirk's 800 Ministers. It concludes by seeking intercession to \\"free us from all bitterness and recrimination\\".","output":"This news article is talking about some problems between Scotland and the United Kingdom (UK) after the UK voted to leave the European Union (EU).

Movie title: Veerapandiya Kattabomman Context: Veerapandiya Kattabomman (Sivaji Ganesan), the king of Panchalankurichi, is a brave fighter and a devotee of his family deity, Lord Murugan of Tiruchendur. On receiving the news of a robbery in his territory, Kattabomman and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When the robbers are captured, they confess that they had been hired by the British to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain. They also tell him that the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, Ettappan (V. K. Ramasamy), to help them in their endeavour to annexe Panchalankurichi. At Chayalkudi, a village near Panchalankurichi, lives Vellaiyammal (Padmini), who vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull. She takes her bull to participate in a Jallikattu game held at Panchalankurichi under Kattabomman's patronage. All those who attempt to tame the bull fail. At Kattabomman's call, his Commander-in-chief, Vellaiyathevan (Gemini Ganesan), subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's love. Later, Kattabomman comes to know of their love and gets them married. Kattabomman receives a message from Lord W. C. Jackson (C. R. Parthiban), collector of Tirunelveli, who demands a meeting with Kattabomman at Ramanathapuram to discuss the payment of Kattabomman's tribute. Captain Davison (S. A. Kannan), Kattabomman's British friend, advises him to go and see Jackson. Jackson, finding that Kattabomman has come to see him with his troops, demands to meet him alone. At the meeting, Jackson insults him and orders his arrest. Though surrounded by the British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes, but Kattabomman's Minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai (M. R. Santhanam), is captured by the British. Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings news that Jackson has been transferred back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai and his men have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question. In ancient Rome, what was the title of a magistrate who was next in importance to a consul?","output":"In ancient Rome, the title of a magistrate who was next in importance to a consul was a \\"Praetor.\\" The office of the praetor emerged around 366 BCE to assist consuls with their increasing administrative and judicial responsibilities. At first, there was only one praetor, but as the Roman Republic expanded, the number of praetors grew. Eventually, around the 2nd century BCE, the number of praetors reached eight. Their main responsibilities included presiding over the administration of justice, both civil and criminal, as well as holding imperium, which granted them the authority to command military forces and govern provinces. Praetors had several key roles to play during their tenure. Firstly, they were responsible for the management of civil law cases in Rome, specifically dealing with disputes between Roman citizens (known as ius civile cases) and disputes between Roman citizens and non-citizens (known as ius gentium cases). The praetors' primary function was to ensure that justice was served and maintain law and order within the Roman state. One of the ways in which they accomplished this was by issuing edicts or praetorian law (edictum praetoris) at the beginning of their term, which set forth the legal procedures and rules they would follow during their time in office. Praetorian law was an important part of Roman law because it enabled the legal system to adapt to new circumstances and evolve over time. As such, the praetor's position was not only administrative but also held a significant legislative component. Secondly, praetors were also responsible for presiding over criminal cases. The two primary types of criminal courts at the time were the quaestiones perpetuae, which focused on a specific type of crime (e.g., murder or treason), and the extraordinary criminal courts (quaestiones extraordinariae), created to address urgent matters that did not fall under the purview of the quaestiones perpetuae. The praetor could play a key role in either court type, by either organizing the court, gathering evidence, or officiating over a trial. Thirdly, since the praetor held imperium, they shared military and political responsibilities with the consuls. This meant that they could be called upon to command armies in times of war or manage provinces in times of peace. While some military campaigns were led by the consuls, others would be delegated to a praetor. In addition, a praetor could also be appointed to govern a province, ensuring Roman laws were enforced, and Rome's interests were maintained in its territories. Such duties included managing taxation and provincial resources and maintaining order in the region. In summary, the praetor was a crucial figure in the Roman Republic who was second only to the consul in terms of power and importance. They played a significant role in maintaining law and order, overseeing both civil and criminal cases, and administrating justice. Furthermore, their duty to uphold Roman law and represent the interests of Rome in provinces or on the battlefield made the praetorian position integral to the functioning and expansion of the Republic."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York. The earliest models were made in 1954 and the last model was made in 1984. Since then the Wurlitzer electric piano sound has been recreated on digital keyboards, and the vintage models are sought by musicians and collectors.  - Supertramp (known as Daddy in 196970) are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of founders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone.  - Richard \\"Rick\\" Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as the founder, vocalist and keyboardist of progressive rock band Supertramp. Davies is the only member of Supertramp to have been with the group for their entire history, and has composed some of their most well-known songs, including \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"My Kind of Lady\\", and \\"Cannonball\\". He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep . He played for Bakerloo , but left the group following the release of its only album . He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp ( then called Daddy ) between late 1969 and early 1970 . Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury , replacing Nigel Olsson . He recorded the album with the group , but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clarke .  - Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp.  - Sir Elton Hercules John, (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer.

Usage: The text provided starts with \\"ロシアのCIS外交を鋭く照射…\\" and goes on until \\"質の高い報告になっている。\\". This is indeed a review written in Japanese, discussing a book about Russia's foreign policy, its interactions with unrecognized nations, and international politics as a whole.  Part #2: Determining whether the overall sentiment of the review is positive or negative. Usage: In this text, comments like \\"新書で読む機会があるとは思わなかった\\" (I did not expect to have a chance to read a new book), \\"情勢分析の質の高さが両立している\\" (The quality of situation analysis and understandability are compatible), and \\"質の高い報告になっている\\" (It's a high quality report) indicate positive sentiments. Even though there are some concerns mentioned, such as \\"異議を唱え、やり直しをさせる\\" (Protesting and letting them redo it) or \\"疲弊しきったコーカサス諸国の未来の暗さを再認識した (I re-realized the future darkness of exhausted Caucasus countries), the overall sentiment can be perceived as positive due to appreciation for the book's content and analysis. Part #3: Classify the review as \\"POS\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as \\"NEG\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative. Usage: Given the above example and the sentiments expressed within it, the student might appropriately respond \\"POS\\" to classify the provided review. The positive remarks about the book outweigh the negative ones, leading to a classification of \\"POS\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a test of commonsense. Complete the next sentence: A group of students stretch out in gym class. A group of band students practice inside a classroom and gym. the school band","output":"The school band is an essential aspect of a well-rounded educational experience, as it offers students rich opportunities to develop their musical talents, collaborate with peers, and enhance their discipline and creativity. Comprising various musical instruments, the band typically performs at school functions, sports events, and community gatherings, showcasing the culmination of hard work and dedicated practice. In a school setting, the band program will often consist of different ensembles, such as a concert band, jazz band, marching band, and pep band, allowing students with diverse skill levels and musical interests to participate. Each ensemble has its unique style and purpose, which contributes greatly to the overall vitality of the school community and encourages the students' artistic growth. The process of learning an instrument and participating in a school band requires immense dedication, as it involves regular practice, attending rehearsals, and refining individual techniques. Students often practice both independently and in an ensemble setting to improve their mastery of their chosen instruments. These sessions take place inside classrooms, gymnasiums, music rooms, and, sometimes, even outdoors, depending on the space and acoustic requirements. School bands place much emphasis on teamwork, as band members must work in harmony to achieve a balanced and cohesive sound. This encourages a supportive and inclusive environment, fostering strong bonds amongst the students, regardless of their age or grade level. Within the band, students also learn important life skills such as time management, goal setting, problem-solving, and accountability. Moreover, the band's leadership roles – such as section leaders, drum majors, and student conductors – help nurture students' confidence and organizational abilities. Performances are an integral part of the school band experience, as they allow the students to showcase their progress and artistic abilities. Through concerts, competitions, and parades, band students grow accustomed to working under pressure, receiving constructive feedback, and striving for excellence. Furthermore, they learn the importance of representing their school and community with poise and pride. In conclusion, a school band can offer various benefits to students as they learn in-depth about their chosen instruments while developing crucial life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. Participating in a band enriches the educational experience by exposing students to diverse musical genres, enhancing their creativity, and providing opportunities for personal and group accomplishments. The school band is an essential element that unites academic and extracurricular activities, reflecting the artistic and cultural diversity of the students and allowing them to thrive in a supportive and stimulating environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - riots - wait in line - suffer pain - bank money - believe in god  I believe the correct choice is \\"bank money\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"bank money\\", because acquiring things that people desire often involves purchasing or financially investing in them. Using bank money, which essentially means using one's savings, credit, or money from financial institutions, allows individuals to exchange currency for goods and services that they desire. The other options listed, such as riots, waiting in line, suffering pain, and believing in God, are not direct methods for acquiring desired items. Rioting, for example, is a form of social unrest and often damages property rather than helping an individual obtain what they desire. Waiting in line may involve patience and possibly result in the acquisition of specific items or services, but this option is limited in its scope and success. Suffering pain, which is a negative experience, does not directly relate to acquiring desired items. Finally, believing in God may provide spiritual and emotional support, but it is not a direct means of acquiring material possessions or goods. Therefore, using bank money is the most logical and effective choice for acquiring things that people desire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\".

Q: What is the simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties?   Choices:  - atom  - molecule  - quark  - element  A: A:","output":"The simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties, based on the given paragraph, is an element.  An element is a pure substance made up of only one type of atom, and it cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Each element has its distinctive set of properties, such as density, melting point, and boiling point, which are determined by the identity and arrangement of its atoms. These properties set it apart from other forms of matter and give it its unique characteristics. Let's briefly look at the other choices provided for a better understanding of why an element is the correct answer: - Atom: Atoms are the building blocks of matter, and they combine to form elements and compounds. While atoms are indeed the smallest units of matter that retain the chemical identity of a substance, they are not the simplest forms of matter with unique properties. The properties of an element are based on the combinations and behavior of its atoms. - Molecule: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms bonded together chemically. Molecules can be made up of atoms from the same element or different elements, forming compounds. Molecules themselves do not possess unique sets of properties but contribute to the properties of the substances they are part of. - Quark: Quarks are elementary particles and a fundamental constituent of matter. They are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which are found in the nucleus of atoms. Though quarks are simpler than atoms, they do not have unique sets of properties that define a specific type of matter, as elements do. Quarks are better understood in the context of particle physics, rather than in terms of defining the simplest form of matter with unique properties. In summary, given the context provided in the paragraph, the simplest form of matter that exhibits a unique set of properties is an element. Elements are distinguished by their distinct properties based on the identity and arrangement of their constituent atoms, setting them apart from other forms of matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Nando Reis (Portuguese pronunciation: ['nadu 'Rejs], born Jose Fernando Gomes dos Reis; January 12, 1963) is a Brazilian musician and producer, best known as the former bassist and one of the lead singers of Brazilian rock band Titas and for his successful solo career, with his own band called Os Infernais. He has also produced a few albums, including some related to Cassia Eller, who has made several significant partnerships with him, and Marisa Monte. In 2012, Nando Reis was listed among the top ten Brazilian artists at the ECAD list of artists who earned the most from copyright in the first semester of that year. Context: Nando Reis was born in Sao Paulo to Cecilia Leonel and Jose Carlos Galvao Gomes dos Reis. He was given his prename \\"Jose\\" just like his brothers, Jose Carlos, the oldest of the children, and Jose Luiz (who is deaf), the younger. His two sisters also shared the same prenames: Maria Cecilia, the older, and Maria Luiza, the youngest of the five, which developed cerebral palsy.  His mother was an acoustic guitar teacher and his father was an engineer. Jose Carlos taught him a little bit of Rock 'n' Roll, showing him Rolling Stones's album Between the Buttons. Maria Cecilia taught him to play the acoustic guitar and took him to a show of Gal Costa and Gilberto Gil.  He was given his first acoustic guitar by his grandmother, at the age of 7, and was taught his first chords by his sister. However, most of his skills were acquired alone, when he learned songs of Caetano Veloso all by himself.  Some friends of Jose Carlos played in a rock band. Once, he took Nando to a small performance at the garage of the bassist house. Impressed with the solos of the guitarist, he asked him to teach him, but he never made it. He also tried the drums, but gave up. He decided then to play the bass guitar, as his attempts to play the electric guitar and the drums failed. Other artists, such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper kept joining his main influences. At the age of eleven, he had classes of classic guitar and harmony with Alexandre (\\"Maranhao\\"), a friend of Jose Carlos. His first compositions were all based on poems. Most of them were long, showing his appreciation for long songs.  In 1978, he entered Equipe School. There, he formed a band called \\"Os Camaroes\\" (The Shrimps) with some friends, and managed to win a local music festival. When he met Paulo Miklos and Arnaldo Antunes, who took part of the festival, he made the first compositions with what would later become Titas. When the high school was over, he waited three years to pass the Mathematics vestibular. Even though Titas where already planning their first show, the university occupied most of his time. Therefore, he decided to quit it. Question: Did he have siblings?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Nando Reis did have siblings.
