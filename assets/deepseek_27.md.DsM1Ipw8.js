Gather materials: Before starting the repair process, gather all the necessary materials, including:    - A needle or toothpick    - Clear fishing line or nylon thread    - A pair of scissors    - A pair of gloves (optional, but recommended to avoid cuts) 2. Assess the size and type of tear: Examine the tear to determine the best repair method. If the tear is small (less than 1/2 inch) and straight, you can likely repair it with the sewing method described below. If the tear is larger or irregular, you may need to consider replacing the entire screen or using a screen repair patch. 3. Prepare the fishing line or nylon thread: Using the needle or toothpick, thread a piece of clear fishing line or nylon thread through it, creating a loop that will be used to sew the tear together. Make sure the length of the fishing line or nylon thread is more than enough to cover the length of the tear. 4. Put on gloves (optional): To prevent any potential cuts from the screen's sharp edges, put on a pair of gloves before starting the repair process. 5. Start sewing the tear: Begin sewing along one edge of the tear, working your way from the bottom to the top. Use the needle or toothpick to guide the fishing line or nylon thread through the tiny holes in the screen, pulling the fishing line or nylon thread taut as you go. The goal here is to create a zig-zag pattern that will hold the screen's edges together. 6. Knot the thread: Once you have reached the end of the tear, secure the fishing line or nylon thread with a double or triple knot. Trim off any excess thread with the scissors. 7. Inspect your work: After you have finished sewing the tear, inspect your work to make sure the zig-zag pattern is holding the edges of the tear together tightly. If there are any loose areas, repeat the sewing process until the entire tear is securely sewn. 8. Apply clear adhesive (optional): If you want to further reinforce the repair, you can apply a small amount of clear adhesive, such as super glue or clear nail polish, along the sewn area to help hold the fishing line or nylon thread in place. Allow the adhesive to dry before using the window screen again. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully repair a small tear in a window screen. Make sure to regularly inspect the screen for any additional wear and tear and address any issues promptly to prolong the life of the screen."},{"instruction":"Lighter, more streamlined vehicles need less energy.

Here is an article: Donald Trump has promised repeatedly throughout his campaign to save the U.S. coal industry after years of bankruptcies and dwindling job prospects for coal miners. On Tuesday, he stood before a crowd in Virginia with “Trump Digs Coal” signs and declared that he was the “last shot for the miners.” But experts say Trump’s plan, to the extent that he has has one, is removed from the tough economic reality of coal, which has been forced to compete with the declining price of alternatives like natural gas and renewable energy sources, even as federal regulations push the U.S. away from fossil fuels. And many believe that Trump’s possibly futile focus on saving the coal industry detracts attention from the real proposals needed to help coal workers transition into new jobs in a new industry. “We really want the solar industry to come to the table now and find ways to get more jobs going in some of these communities that need jobs,” says Van Jones, an environmental activist who served as President Obama’s first-term green jobs czar. “If we’re concerned about coal country, and I am, we have to do a lot more than just yell.” U.S. mines produced about 900 million tons of coal last year, a nearly 25% decline since 2008 and the lowest amount of production since 1986, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The change has come as energy companies have built up their natural gas and renewable capacity. The decline in coal production has led the industry to hemorrhage workers, with 50,000 coal-related jobs lost between 2008 and 2012, according to a study from last year. And that’s just the latest in a downward slope in the industry since the 1980s due to mechanization that displaced human labor. The coal mining industry directly employed more than 140,000 in 1989 and and only 85,000 a decade later, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Experts agree that reversing that trend would be next to impossible without huge subsidies for the industry, as it is changing market factors—more than government policy—that has driven the decline in coal production. The development of fracking has expanded dramatically the availability of natural gas, making the largely cleaner fuel source cheaper than coal in most cases. And, in recent years, renewable energy sources like wind and solar have become cost-competitive with coal in many places. But Trump and many Republicans place the blame for the loss of coal jobs on President Obama’s “war on coal.” Indeed, Trump’s plan to revive coal mostly revolves around removing existing regulations. “We’re going to save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda,” he said at during an energy policy speech in May. “Any regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped.” Trump’s campaign did not return a request for comment Friday. Undoubtedly, regulations from his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have contributed to reduced demand for coal. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, sets standards that will require many states to phase out coal-fired power plants if implemented. But the regulations merely expedite a trend already in progress. There is hope for coal workers losing their job—or at least there could be. The number of jobs in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, has skyrocketed even as the number of coal jobs has dwindled. The solar industry alone employs more than 200,000 people and has been growing at a rate of 20% annually, according to a report from the Solar Foundation. Another 80,000 were employed in the wind industry with similar levels of growth, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association. A new study published in the journal Energy Economics found that most coal employees could be retrained for similar jobs in the solar industry with relatively little investment. Researchers behind the study, which relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared a job in the coal industry with it closest equivalent in the solar industry. The solar industry could easily absorb the expected job losses and many employees might even see a salary increase, according to the research. “There are not that many more jobs coming in the coal mines, period. There aren’t that many jobs coming on oil rigs, period,” says Jones. “At some point we have to accept the fact that the clean energy companies are growing faster than everything else.” Many politicians and policymakers have proposed programs to help coal workers transition into these jobs. President Obama’s recent budget requests have included billions of dollars for a variety of programs to aid communities hurt by the declining coal industry, including job transition initiatives. Some of those programs have received funding from Congress, like the POWER program that provides economic development grants to affected areas. Other proposals for coal communities have gone unfunded. Despite a gaffe where Hillary Clinton said she would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” Clinton herself has a fairly expansive plan to aid hurting coal communities with a price tag of 30 billion. That includes providing health care benefits to former miners, investing in job education and repurposing old coal infrastructure for clean tech. Clinton’s plans may not be perfect. A West Virginia Coal Association executive described it as an insufficient “care package.” But the reality is that America is already moving past coal, for environmental and economic reasons. If Trump “digs coal” and the people who actually dig it, he’ll need to figure out a way to make sure those workers aren’t left behind. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Trump's Promise to Save Coal Industry Clashes with Economic Reality and Renewable Energy Growth\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - Chambers Motors was the first automobile manufacturer in Ireland . The company built vehicles by hand featuring high - quality components designed and fabricated in - house . Passenger cars were made to suit doctors and wealthy businessmen , and commercial vehicles were produced for duty as delivery vans , ambulances , and hearses . A key feature of the vehicles was a unique design of epicyclic gearbox in the rear axle . Chambers Motors employed around 75 people and built approximately 500 vehicles in 25 years of operation .  - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

Controversy persists over whether the Rus’ were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \\"Normanist\\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.

Write a question about the following article: When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for Švitrigaila, who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites. The final Battle of Pabaiskas was fought in September 1435 near Ukmergė , northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides. Švitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian-Polish army, led by Michael Žygimantaitis, and soundly defeated. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410. On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish-Lithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War , the civil war that would tear Prussia in half.

This article: The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Problem: the captain of a cricket team of 11 members is 27 years old and the wicket keeper is 1 year older . if the ages of these two are excluded , the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team . what is the average age of the team ?  Options: a ) 20 , b ) 21 , c ) 22 , d ) 23 , e ) 24","output":"Let \\"x\\" be the average age of the whole team. Therefore, the total age of the team would be 11x (since there are 11 members in the team). Given that the captain is 27 years and the wicketkeeper is 1 year older (28 years), the combined age of the captain and wicketkeeper is 27 + 28 = 55 years. If we exclude the ages of captain and wicketkeeper, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team, i.e., (x - 1). There are 9 remaining players, so the total age of the remaining players would be 9(x - 1). Now, we can set up the equation: 11x - 55 = 9(x - 1) Now, let's solve the equation. 11x - 55 = 9x - 9 2x = 46 x = 23 So the average age of the whole team is 23 years, which corresponds to option (d)."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Are the following two questions the same? Can Shia and Sunni Muslims be compared to Catholic and Lutheran Christians? Is the Sunni/Shia split in Islam comparable in any way to the Protestant/Catholic split in Christianity?","output":"Yes, the two questions are essentially asking the same thing: whether the Sunni/Shia split in Islam can be compared to the Catholic/Protestant (specifically Catholic and Lutheran) split in Christianity. While both comparisons concern major schisms in two of the world's largest faiths, there are important differences and similarities between the two divisions. Sunni/Shia Split in Islam: The Sunni/Shia split in Islam began after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE. Following his death, a disagreement arose over the rightful successor to lead the Muslim community. The majority (now Sunni Muslims) supported the election of Abu Bakr, the Prophet's close companion, as the first caliph, while a minority (now Shia Muslims) felt that Ali, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, was divinely appointed to succeed him. This disagreement never fully resolved, leading to a permanent division in the Muslim world. Over the centuries, religious, political, and cultural differences emerged between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Sunnis recognize and adhere to the first four caliphs, while Shias only acknowledge Ali and his descendants as rightful leaders. Theologically, Sunni and Shia Muslims follow different interpretations of Islamic teachings and texts, like the role of the imamate and the authority of religious leaders. Despite these differences, they share many similarities, such as the core tenets of faith, the Five Pillars of Islam, and the holy book, the Quran. Catholic/Protestant (Catholic/Lutheran) Split in Christianity: The Catholic/Protestant divide in Christianity began during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. This movement was sparked by grievances with the Catholic Church, which was seen as corrupt and politically influential. Martin Luther, a German theologian, nailed his \\"95 Theses\\" to the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg in 1517, critiquing various practices, including the sale of indulgences. His challenges to the authority of the Pope and the Church led to a broader reformation, spearheaded by other reformers like John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Catholicism and Protestantism, including Lutheranism, differ significantly on matters of theology, liturgy, and ecclesiastical structure. Some key differences include the role of Scripture, the concept of salvation, the importance of sacraments, and the structure of church governance. However, both denominations share core Christian beliefs, acknowledging Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the significance of the Bible as a sacred text. Comparing the Sunni/Shia and Catholic/Protestant Splits: The Sunni/Shia split in Islam and the Catholic/Protestant split in Christianity share some general similarities in terms of creating long-lasting divisions within the respective religions: 1. Both schisms were rooted in disputes over religious leadership and authority. 2. The divisions have cemented over time, leading to differences in theology, worship, and religious practices. 3. Each schism has had significant political and social implications, sometimes resulting in violence and wars. However, the historical, cultural, and doctrinal contexts of these schisms differ in the following ways: 1. The origins of the Sunni/Shia split date back to the seventh century, while the Catholic/Protestant split occurred in the 16th century. 2. The disputes leading to the Islamic split occurred shortly after the founding of Islam and were more closely connected to the Prophet's immediate successors. In contrast, the Protestant Reformation emerged as a reaction to long-standing practices and corruption within the Catholic Church. 3. The Sunni/Shia divide has a stronger emphasis on succession and the role of religious leaders in the Islamic tradition, whereas the Catholic/Protestant split focuses more on the relationship between Scripture, Church authority, and individual believers. In conclusion, although both questions are asking if the Sunni/Shia split in Islam can be compared to the Catholic/Protestant (Catholic and Lutheran) split in Christianity, it is essential to recognize the distinct historical contexts and differences in theology, ritual, and governance. While there are some broad similarities between the two schisms, understanding and respecting the uniqueness of each religious tradition is crucial for fostering interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur.  Paragraph: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would experiment B's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide?","output":"Based on the given paragraph, experiment B's hydroxide (ground NaOH) would have a larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide (solid pellets of NaOH). This is because grinding the pellets into smaller pieces increases the total surface area, exposing more hydroxide ions to the HCl gas and allowing for faster overall reaction rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"A source close to Sandy Easdale has told BBC Scotland that Rafat Rizvi has been introducing investors to Rangers.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Rafat Rizvi Introduces Investors to Rangers – What's Next for the Scottish Football Giants? Introduction A reliable source close to entrepreneur, Sandy Easdale, who is known for his shareholding with the Rangers International Football Club (RIFC) until recently, has exclusively informed BBC Scotland that Rafat Rizvi has been actively introducing potential investors to the Rangers Football Club. This development could signify a potential expansion of financial horizons and investment for the historic Scottish club. In this article, we will delve into the implications of this news, the roles of Sandy Easdale and Rafat Rizvi, and the possible future directions for Rangers in terms of investment and sponsorship. Background on Sandy Easdale and Rafat Rizvi Sandy Easdale is a renowned Scottish businessman with a history of holding shares in multiple businesses across various sectors. He was one of the most significant shareholders in the Rangers International Football Club, having held non-executive roles in the past. Rafat Rizvi, on the other hand, is a British businessman known for his extensive network of contacts and expertise in the business world. Rizvi was rumored to have been instrumental in a 2014 deal assisting the financially struggling Rangers to secure new funding by attracting international investors, which was reported to have advanced the club's prospects significantly. Connecting the Dots: Rizvi's Involvement with Rangers Investors The news that Rafat Rizvi is introducing potential investors to Rangers should not come as a surprise, considering his past involvement with the club and his reputation for connecting businesses with suitable investors. His connections within the football world and beyond could provide the Glasgow-based club with ample opportunities for expansion and growth. Since Rangers have struggled financially over the years – from administration to their freefall through Scotland's football divisions – the introduction of new investors could potentially rejuvenate the club's financial health and facilitate improved on-field performances, satisfying both fans and stakeholders. It could also offer Rangers the means to sign new players, invest in infrastructure, and bolster their marketing and merchandising efforts. The Potential Investors and What They Could Bring to the Table While the identities of the investors Rizvi might be introducing to Rangers have not been disclosed, it is believed that they could belong to a mix of UK-based and international parties. These investors could bring in a myriad of benefits for the club, such as: 1. A fresh infusion of capital – New investors would likely inject a significant amount of money into the club, which could alleviate existing debt and create a stronger financial base, leading to better performances both on and off the field. 2. Expertise and experience – As seasoned investors or entrepreneurs, they might bring valuable experience in business and football to the club. This could potentially improve Rangers' overall decision-making and long-term strategic planning. 3. Global outreach – A diverse pool of investors could expand Rangers' international presence and recognition, potentially opening up new revenue streams through global sponsorship deals and partnerships. The Road Ahead for Rangers With Rafat Rizvi's involvement and the potential influx of new investors, the future outlook for Rangers appears promising. While the club's path has encountered numerous obstacles in the past, the financial groundwork laid by these new investments could send the Rangers on an upward trajectory. However, it's crucial that the club uses the resources wisely and puts efficient strategies in place to ensure that these investments result in long-lasting, positive change for the team and its supporters. Conclusion The news of Rafat Rizvi introducing potential investors to Rangers could mark a turning point for the club as it navigates its way through both financial and competitive challenges. If the club capitalizes on this opportunity and leverages the resources brought in by these investors strategically, Rangers could enjoy a renaissance – both on a financial level and as a competitive force in Scottish football. As fans and supporters eagerly await further news, the developments sparked by these introductions will undoubtedly be watched with keen interest."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"In the 1994 original Disney animated film \\"The Lion King,\\" the character Scar was brought to life with an unforgettable vocal performance. The talented actor who lent his voice to Scar was the renowned British actor Jeremy Irons. Jeremy Irons not only spoke for Scar, but he also sang the villain's most iconic song \\"Be Prepared,\\" which is the third song in the film. \\"Be Prepared\\" sets the stage for Scar's nefarious plan to overthrow his brother Mufasa and claim the throne as the king of Pride Rock. The song was written by Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics), who are both legendary artists in the world of music and theater. In \\"Be Prepared,\\" Scar manipulates a group of cunning hyenas - Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed - to rally behind him and support his evil schemes to seize power in the Pride Lands. The song is often praised for its captivating melody and powerful lyrics, which convey the ruthlessness and cunning of Scar as he readies his forces for the ultimate act of betrayal. Jeremy Irons, with his distinctive and dark voice, perfectly embodied the sinister persona of Scar. This portrayal, combined with fantastic animation and the stirring music, turned Scar into one of the most memorable and scorned villains in the Disney universe. It's important to note that due to vocal strain after singing most of \\"Be Prepared,\\" Jeremy Irons was unable to complete the sequence, and his voice was blended with that of American voice actor, singer, and vocal coach Jim Cummings, best known for voicing Winnie the Pooh and Tigger. Cummings has a strong background in voice acting and singing and blended seamlessly with Irons' voice to maintain the musical continuity in the song. In the 2019 live-action/CGI version of \\"The Lion King,\\" Scar is voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor, an English actor known for films like \\"12 Years a Slave\\" and \\"Doctor Strange.\\" Although performed differently to suit this version of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor also sings \\"Be Prepared\\" in the film, proving that the song remains essential even as new generations discover the story."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which company made less fuel for trucks?  Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  Hint: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. Answer:","output":"Company H made less fuel for trucks. Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products, which are majorly used as fuel for vehicles like cars, trucks, airplanes, and trains.

Given the question: Information:  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - \`\` When the People Fell '' is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith , set in his \`\` Instrumentality '' universe . It was originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in April , 1959 , and is most recently collected in The Rediscovery of Man , and in the collection of which it is the title story . The story takes place relatively early in the Instrumentality timeline , and a \`\` scanner Vomact '' appears both in this story and the classic story \`\` Scanners Live in Vain '' . The story recounts , in \`\` flashback '' form -- an interview between a reporter and a crusty old - timer -- a risky attempt by a future Chinese government to claim and settle the planet Venus , at a time when China is the only ethnic nation on Earth which has survived as a separate entity through a global nuclear war and a long dark age which followed . The story implicitly compares Western and Chinese approaches to solving an impossible problem and has the Chinese solution succeed , but at a cost Westerners would find repugnant .  - In the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, the Instrumentality of Mankind refers both to Smith's personal future history and universe and to the central government of humanity. \\"The Instrumentality of Mankind\\" is also the title of a paperback collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith published in 1979 (now superseded by the later \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\", which collects all of Smith's short stories).  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet.  - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914  February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.  - NESFA Press is the publishing arm of the New England Science Fiction Association, Inc. The NESFA Press primarily produces three types of books:  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith (ISBN 0-915368-56-0) is a 1993 book containing the complete collected short fiction of science fiction author Cordwainer Smith. It was edited by James A. Mann and published by NESFA Press.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Cordwainer Smith was the pen-name used by American author Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (July 11, 1913  August 6, 1966) for his science fiction works. Linebarger was a noted East Asia scholar and expert in psychological warfare. (\\"Cordwainer\\" is an archaic word for \\"a worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker\\", and a \\"smith\\" is \\"one who works in iron or other metals; esp. a blacksmith or farrier\\": two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.) Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms \\"Carmichael Smith\\" (for his political thriller \\"Atomsk\\"), \\"Anthony Bearden\\" (for his poetry) and \\"Felix C. Forrest\\" (for the novels \\"Ria\\" and \\"Carola\\").  He died of a heart attack in 1966 at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 53.  - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - \\"Scanners Live in Vain\\" is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Linebarger), set in his Instrumentality of Mankind future history. It was originally published in the magazine \\"Fantasy Book\\" in 1950. It was judged by the Science Fiction Writers of America to be one of the finest short stories prior to 1965 and was included in the anthology \\"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964\\". A revised text, based on Linebarger's original manuscript, appears in the 1993 NESFA Press collection \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" (where it is accompanied by a facsimile of his original cover letter) and the 2007 collection \\"When the People Fell\\". The story was nominated for a Retro Hugo award in 2001. It has been published in Hebrew, Italian, French, German and Dutch translations.  - The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964 is a 1970 anthology of science fiction short stories, edited by Robert Silverberg. It is generally considered one of the best of the many science fiction anthologies. Author Lester del Rey said that \\"it even lives up to its subtitle\\", referring to the volume's boast of containing \\"The Greatest Science-Fiction Stories of All Time\\".   - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space.  - A future history is a postulated history of the future and is used by authors in the subgenre of speculative fiction (or science fiction) to construct a common background for fiction. Sometimes the author publishes a timeline of events in the history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information provided therein.

Article: Elderly women who eat foods higher in potassium   are less likely to have strokes and die than women who eat less potassium-rich foods, according to new research in the American Heart Association. \\"Previous studies have shown that potassium consumption may lower blood pressure. But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke   or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.  Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes  , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk.  \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Passage: In 1923, during the American Museum of Natural History expedition by Roy Chapman Andrews to Inner Mongolia, Peter Kaisen discovered numerous theropod remains in three quarries. These were named and shortly described by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1933 as a new species of Ornithomimus: Ornithomimus asiaticus. The specific name refers to the Asian provenance. The species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus by Dale Russell in 1972, making Archaeornithomimus asiaticus the type species of the genus. The generic name combines that of Ornithomimus with a Greek ἀρχαῖος (archaios), \\"ancient\\", because Russell mistakenly believed that the layers Archaeornithomimus was found in dated to the Cenomanian-Turonian, about 95 million years old, making it one of the oldest ornithomimids known at the time. Gilmore had not assigned a holotype specimen; in 1990 David Smith and Peter Galton in the first comprehensive description of the fossils, choose specimen AMNH 6565, a foot, as the lectotype.  Link Information: Alan Russell (born 27 December 1937) Question: What age was Dale Russell when the species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus? A:","output":"Part #1: Determine the time frame when the species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus. Usage: The species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus by Dale Russell in 1972. Explanation: This part of the passage provides the year when this event occurred. Part #2: Identify Dale Russell's date of birth. Usage: Alan Russell (born 27 December 1937). Explanation: This information from the linked term gives Dale Russell's date of birth. Part #3: Calculate Dale Russell's age at the time when the species was placed in the new genus. Usage: 1972 - 1937 = 35. Explanation: Subtracting Dale Russell's birth year from the year when the species was placed in the new genus gives us his age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - park - reduce - descend - fall - set A:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the above question is \\"descend.\\" As the counterweight began to rise, the elevator began to descend into the mine. In an elevator system, a counterweight is used to balance the weight of the elevator car and the passengers or cargo inside it. This balance ensures that the overall system operates efficiently and safely. When the elevator is called to move, the electric motor inside the machine starts to reel in the steel cables, which in turn moves the car up or down on the guide rails. As the counterweight rises, it works against the force of gravity to provide balance and support to the elevator car. This action ensures that the motor does not have to work as hard to lift or lower the car, thereby conserving energy and ensuring that the system moves smoothly. As the counterweight moves upward, it pulls the elevator car in the opposite direction, causing it to descend into the mine. In a mining environment, elevators play a critical role in the transport of workers, machinery, equipment, and materials to and from the various levels of the mine. The descent of the elevator into the mine enables safe and efficient access to the working areas, helping to support the productivity and safety of the overall mining operation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs.","output":"The missing first step of this process is the \\"emission of solar radiation by the Sun.\\" Below is a detailed explanation of the whole process: 1. Emission of Solar Radiation by the Sun: The process of global warming starts with the Sun. Our star's energy is generated by nuclear fusion in its core, where extremely high pressure and temperature combine hydrogen atoms to create helium, releasing light and heat in the process. This energy is radiated into space in all directions as electromagnetic waves, known as solar radiation. Some of these waves, particularly those in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, travel across space to the Earth, with a tiny fraction of the Sun's total radiation reaching our planet.  2. The Radiation is Absorbed by the Earth: When the solar rays reach Earth, they interact with Earth's atmosphere and surface. Roughly a third of this radiation is reflected back into space by clouds, atmospheric particles, and bright surfaces like ice and snow. The rest passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the land, oceans, and vegetation on Earth's surface. This absorbed solar energy warms the Earth and is transformed into heat. 3. Some of the Radiation Goes Back into Space: Earth, being warm, also radiates energy back out to space, but in the form of infrared or heat energy. However, before this heat energy can escape to space, certain atmospheric gases known as greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) can absorb it. 4. Some is Trapped by the Atmosphere: Once the radiation is absorbed by these greenhouse gases, they re-emit the heat in all directions. Some of this heat is sent back towards Earth's surface, causing a warming effect. This natural process is known as the greenhouse effect, and it is crucial for life as it keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life. 5. If Too Much Heat is Trapped: While the greenhouse effect is natural and necessary, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have added large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This enhancement elevates the natural greenhouse effect, causing more heat to be trapped than necessary, leading to an overall warming of the Earth. 6. Global Warming Occurs: The accumulated effect of these actions is global warming, an increase in Earth's average temperature. The enhanced greenhouse effect is causing Earth's average temperature to rise, disrupting climate patterns and ecosystems worldwide. This can lead to severe consequences, including sea-level rise, more frequent extreme weather events, and mass extinction of certain species. Thus, understanding this process is essential to identifying ways we can reduce our impact and mitigate climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hale’s magnetic, mesmerizing ‘Self-Portrait’ There’s blood in that pale, sinewy hand. Blood and resolve. Idle for now, it won’t stay that way for long. It’s poised for action. The hand belonged to Ellen Day Hale, who painted it herself in 1885. It’s part of a self-portrait, one of the best in the Museum of Fine Arts, where it hangs in the Art of the Americas Wing, in a gallery devoted to the so-called Boston School. Like all the other works in this gem of a gallery, the work is pleasing to look at. It’s easy to appreciate the loosely brushed blue background with its scattering of parti-colored blossoms; the big round ostrich feather fan in the foreground; the rich array of blacks. But before you can register this — before “taste” and “design” have a chance to announce themselves — what arrests your attention is all psychological. Hale appraises us with intelligent, unforgiving eyes that won’t let us go. She is not interested in foolishness or play acting. Both her tilted head, so dramatically and brilliantly rendered, and its off-center position enhance the portrait’s immediacy. Like Edgar Degas’s breakthrough 1865 portrait, “Woman Seated Beside a Vase of Flowers,” which shows a woman simultaneously sidelined and made more vivid by a huge bunch of flowers, it increases the sense we have that this is a real woman occupying space in real time — as opposed to “portrait time,” which is imaginary. Hale gives us no choice. You glance in the painting’s direction, and almost hear the whoosh and click, like a magnet hoovering up metal. Hale had just returned from Paris when she painted it. She was born in Worcester into a distinguished Boston Brahmin family (her great aunt was Harriet Beecher Stowe) on Feb. 11, 1855. She died on the same day 85 years later. Her brother was the artist and critic Philip Leslie Hale, who married the wonderful painter Lilian Westcott Hale. She was around artists, writers, educators, and women’s suffragists a lot. She studied art with William Rimmer, and then with William Morris Hunt and his co-teacher, Helen Knowlton, who had a special impact, before furthering her studies in Philadelphia and Paris. She never married, but in 1883 she met fellow artist Gabrielle DeVeaux Clements, with whom she later settled down in a house called “The Thickets” in Gloucester. What, I still wonder, is the look she is giving me, as I stand before this self-portrait? I could throw words at it: disdainful, intolerant of fools, appraising, anxiously tender. But none will stick; all seem less than half-true. In any case, she is not looking at me. She is looking at herself. What she saw there probably surprised and engaged her as much as it does me.

However, it does mention that there were multiple slave uprisings during this period. For a more detailed and long answer to this question, we can explore some of the significant uprisings and civil wars that took place in Rome during the 1st century BC. 1. The Spartacus Revolt (73-71 BC): This was a significant slave uprising led by the gladiator Spartacus. Thousands of slaves joined forces with him to fight against the Roman Republic. Eventually, the rebels were defeated by Roman generals Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey the Great. 2. The Sertorian War (80-72 BC): This civil war took place in the Roman province of Hispania. It was led by Quintus Sertorius, a Roman statesman and general, who revolted against the centralized power of the Roman Republic and sought to create an independent state in Hispania. He was eventually defeated by Pompey the Great. 3. The Catilinarian Conspiracy (63 BC): This was a political conspiracy led by the Roman senator Lucius Sergius Catilina. He aimed to overthrow the Roman Republic and the consulship of Cicero and Antonius Hybrida. The conspiracy was discovered and thwarted by the famous Roman orator and statesman Cicero. 4. The First Triumvirate (60-53 BC): Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus formed a political alliance to control the Roman Republic. This alliance led to several power struggles and eventually contributed to Caesar's rise in power. 5. Caesar's Civil War (49-45 BC): Caesar's growing power and influence threatened the Roman Senate, leading to a civil war between supporters of Caesar and those of Pompey the Great. Caesar emerged victorious, leading to the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. 6. The Perusine War (41-40 BC): This was a civil war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian (later Augustus) over the control of the city of Perusia (present-day Perugia, Italy). The city eventually surrendered to Octavian, and the war ended with Antony and Octavian reconciling. 7. The Final War of the Roman Republic (32-30 BC): This was a war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian, who had grown tired of sharing power. Octavian defeated Antony and his Egyptian ally, Cleopatra, in the Battle of Actium. Following their defeat, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, and Octavian became the sole ruler of Rome, ushering in the Roman Empire and taking the title Augustus. These are only a few examples of rebellious uprisings and civil wars that took place in Rome during the 1st century BC. The given statement highlights the occurrence of slave uprisings, but it does not provide a specific number of rebellions or civil wars during that period."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Exporting Raymond is a 2010 documentary film directed by Philip Rosenthal.

Choices: + unacceptable + acceptable","output":"First, we should understand what is meant by a sentence being syntactically and semantically acceptable: - Syntax refers to the rules in a language that determine how words and phrases should be arranged in a sentence to make it meaningful. If a sentence is syntactically correct, it will follow these rules.  - Semantics refers to the meaning that is conveyed by a text. If a sentence is semantically correct, it will be meaningful. Step 1: Evaluating the syntax: \\"The dog that the rat bit chased the cat.\\" Here, \\"the dog\\" is the subject, \\"chased\\" is the verb, and \\"the cat\\" is the object.

The relative clause adds extra information about the dog. The construction of the sentence, including placement of subject, verb and use of relative clause, is correct according to English syntax rules. Step 2: Evaluating the semantics: Semantically, the sentence indicates that a dog, which was bitten by a rat, chased a cat. All the words are used appropriately in the sentence, and the sentence as a whole represents a coherent and plausible scenario, hence it is meaningful.

The Police The answer is:","output":"Title: Echoes of Justice Genre: Crime Drama, Mystery, Thriller Plot Overview: In the small town of Redhaven, a series of inexplicable crimes have plagued the community for years. Desperate to end the chaos, the residents turn to the local amateur detective, Charles, who is known for his brilliant mind and uncanny ability to crack even the most difficult cases. However, this case feels different - it appears that the criminals always seem to be one step ahead. As Charles digs deeper into the case, he begins to unveil the secrets and dark history of Redhaven that put his own life in danger. Act 1: The film opens with the discovery of the latest crime scene - a brutal murder of a local store owner. Local law enforcement is baffled, and essentially all leads appear to be dead ends. The small community grows restless, prompting the local sheriff to reluctantly ask for Charles' help. Charles begins his investigation and discovers the first clue - a mysterious symbol etched into the wall at the crime scene. As he continues to investigate, more crimes emerge, each bearing the same cryptic symbol. Charles becomes increasingly entangled in the twisted web of the case. Act 2: As the case progresses, the frequency and severity of the crimes increase. Tension grows within the town as people begin to distrust one another. At the same time, Charles starts to uncover the dark history of Redhaven - including a dangerous criminal organization that once ruled the town in fear. However, after a police raid 15 years ago, the organization was thought to have been dismantled. Charles soon realizes that the symbol is the organization's long-forgotten emblem, signaling their reemergence. He suspects that someone from the town’s past is orchestrating the crimes in order to reestablish the organization's dominance. The revelation is met with disbelief and denial by the community, as the memory of the organization's control still haunts them. Act 3: As Charles gathers evidence, he identifies the mastermind behind the organized crime resurgence - Thomas, a highly influential and respected city official who is hell-bent on asserting control over the town once again. Charles confronts Thomas, who reveals that the town’s corruption runs much deeper than he initially thought. Thomas tells Charles he was once a member of the disbanded criminal organization but secretly continued recruiting people and orchestrating crimes under the radar for years. However, his pride doesn't allow him to fully confess his crimes, as he genuinely believes controlling the town is for the greater good. Charles collects enough evidence to reveal Thomas' involvement but gets captured by his associates, who take him to a remote location in a bid to silence him. A tense standoff ensues as Charles manages to escape, with Thomas and his associates close behind him. Climax: Ultimately, Charles is cornered in an old factory, where he and Thomas have a final confrontation. Thomas admits that his thirst for power has consumed him and that his actions have gone too far. Charles uses his wit and intelligence to outsmart Thomas, who eventually drops his guard. As Thomas prepares to finish off Charles, a swarm of police cars led by the local sheriff converge on the location. The film ends with Thomas' arrest and the dismantling of the criminal network. Resolution: With Thomas in police custody and the imminent dismantling of the criminal organization, Redhaven finally finds peace. Charles is hailed as a hero and acknowledged by the police for his involvement in solving the case. However, in light of the town's dark past, Charles decides to continue his investigations, signaling that the quest for truth and justice is never-ending."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Several factors contribute to the negative tone in the review. Firstly, the title of the review \\"Too Big!\\" highlights the main issue the reviewer has with the product. The use of an exclamation point emphasizes the dissatisfaction and urgency of the problem. It immediately sets the stage for the reader to expect a negative review. In the body of the review, the user specifically mentions that the product \\"runs huge\\" and compares it to a different size, 2XL, which indicates that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of sizing. The statement \\"I will never be able to wear it for any kind of support\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's discontent and disappointment with the product. In addition, the use of words like \\"never\\" adds a strong negative feeling to the review. The reviewer's inability to utilize the product for its intended purpose, which they describe as \\"support,\\" demonstrates that the product has failed to meet their needs.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

Therefore, the answer to the multi-choice problem is: *no; Now, let us address each question individually: 1. What do the English think of Americans? It is important to recognize that opinions and attitudes can vary greatly among individuals within any given group. However, there are some general themes or stereotypes that can be identified when it comes to how the English perceive Americans.  Typically, the English may view Americans as friendly and outgoing, but there can also be perceptions of Americans being a bit loud or overly patriotic. Some English people might admire the United States' optimism, entrepreneurial spirit, and the opportunities the country offers. On the other hand, the English might be critical of certain American policies, such as gun ownership, healthcare, or the political landscape. They may also find aspects of American culture, like consumerism or different accents, to be somewhat peculiar. 2. What do Americans think of the English? Again, opinions can differ significantly between individuals; however, some general themes or stereotypes can be noted in how Americans perceive the English. The English are often viewed by Americans as polite, reserved, and well-mannered. Americans might admire certain aspects of English culture, such as their rich history, tradition, and the Royal Family. Additionally, many Americans enjoy British television shows, music, and literature. On the other hand, some Americans might perceive the English as being a bit snobbish or overly formal, associating their accents with intelligence, sophistication, or poshness. It's not uncommon for Americans to find certain British customs, colloquialisms, or their sense of humor to be somewhat baffling. In conclusion, while these questions inquire about related topics, they are not asking for the same information.

The second U.S. Ebola victim is back on American soil after her plane landed at Bangor International Airport in Maine early on Tuesday. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. Mrs Writebol, from North Carolina, left Monrovia airport in West Africa early on Tuesday on a chartered plane. She will be treated at Emory University Hospital along with fellow missionary and doctor Dr Kent Brantly in a special quarantine wing. Scroll down for video. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. Back in the States: Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, is due to arrive in Atlanta today to be treated at Emory University Hospital alongside Dr Kent Brantly. Mrs Writebol's son, Jeremy, said his mother 'is still struggling' but that 'there seems to be improvement'. The two Americans infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans. The aid worker is reportedly in a stable condition after receiving a second dose of the drug. Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Mrs Writebol has shown some improvement. over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian. potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. Care: Writebol will join fellow infected aid worker Dr Kent Bradley (pictured) at Emory University Hospital for treatment. However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90 per cent of patients. Jeremy Writebol believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus. The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.' Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol contracted. Ebola after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of. the virus around Monrovia, Liberia. More than 1,300 people have been. stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra. Leone. Quarantine: This is the specially-designed tent that was set up to quarantine the Ebola patients while they fly home aboard the GulfStream air ambulance. The specially-designed air ambulance, seen here taking off from Dobbin Air Reserve Base in Georgia, picked up Mrs Writebol in Liberia. Ebola has no vaccine or antidote. However, both Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were given an experimental treatment last week, according to international relief group Samaritan's Purse. The group originally said that only Writebol got the treatment. Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, according to the organization. Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers. Mrs Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Missionaries: Nancy and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the hospital where Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties. A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen. Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus. David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans. Recovering: Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital, after receiving a dose of an experimental serum. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've been criticized for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital. But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again on Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States. Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region. But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be. 'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies. 'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said. 'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.' Quarantine facilities around the U.S: A widespread Ebola outbreak in the country is 'not in the cards', the CDC director said. That is partly down to the number of quarantine facilities, where the CDC can legally detain anyone who might have been exposed to a number of diseases. Highlights:","output":"1.

Write the answer: Who became famous through three films made in 1955 and 1956, and died at the wheel of a Porsche in 1956?","output":"James Dean, an iconic American actor, achieved immense fame and recognition through three films made in 1955 and 1956 and tragically died at the wheel of his Porsche in 1956. Born on February 8, 1931, in Marion, Indiana, USA, James Byron Dean quickly rose to fame and became a symbol of the struggle and angst experienced by young people during the post-World War II era. The three films that made James Dean famous are \\"East of Eden,\\" \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" and \\"Giant.\\" These films showcased Dean's incredible talent and screen presence, highlighting his ability to embody the complexity of his characters and bring out their emotional vulnerability. 1. \\"East of Eden\\" (1955): Directed by Elia Kazan and based on John Steinbeck's novel of the same name, \\"East of Eden\\" tells the story of two estranged brothers, Cal (played by James Dean) and Aron (played by Richard Davalos), who compete for their father's affection. Dean's portrayal of the tormented and rebellious Cal Trask earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, the first posthumous nomination in that category. The film showcased Dean's natural ability to play complex characters who challenge societal norms. 2. \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" (1955): Directed by Nicholas Ray, this drama revolves around the life of a troubled teenager named Jim Stark (played by James Dean). The story portrays the struggle of Jim as he tries to fit into a new town while grappling with the emotional turmoil caused by his dysfunctional family. Dean's performance in \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" resonated with American teenagers who felt alienated from their parents and the broader society. Dean received his second posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role in this film. 3. \\"Giant\\" (1956): Directed by George Stevens, \\"Giant\\" is a sweeping epic drama based on the novel by Edna Ferber. This movie chronicles the tumultuous lives of a Texas cattle rancher, his family, and the people around them, including Jett Rink (played by James Dean). Dean's performance showcased his ability to play a much older character and deal with the complex emotions associated with greed and ambition. Although Dean did not receive an Academy Award nomination for his role in \\"Giant,\\" the film itself was an immense critical and commercial success. These three films helped solidify James Dean's status as a cultural icon and timeless symbol of teenage disillusionment and rebellion. Unfortunately, Dean's skyrocketing career was cut short when he died in a car accident on September 30, 1956. Dean was driving his Porsche 550 Spyder, nicknamed \\"Little Bastard,\\" when he collided with another vehicle at the junction of California State Route 46 and 41. He was only 24 years old at the time of his tragic death, which added to his enigmatic and enduring legacy. James Dean's brief yet impactful career has left an indelible mark on the film industry and pop culture, with many actors and filmmakers citing him as a significant influence. Even today, Dean continues to be celebrated for his outstanding talent and contributions to cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, we want to get l by itself. So, we need to get rid of the -8 that's being multiplied with l. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -8. It looks like this: -8 * l / -8 = -8 / -8 5. Now, we can cancel -8 on both sides. This leaves us with: l = 1 So, the solution for l in the equation -8 * l + 8 = 0 is l = 1.

This brief statement has an unfavorable connotation, implying that the movie has poorly executed elements or is of low quality in terms of its filmmaking techniques. In this context, \\"bad\\" refers to an unfavorable or negative quality, possibly pertaining to a combination of factors, such as a lackluster screenplay, weak dialogues, unconvincing acting, amateurish editing, off-putting sound design, or subpar cinematography. The word \\"filmmaking\\" encompasses the entire process, which includes everything from pre-production to post-production, of creating a film, and so when preceded by \\"bad,\\" it denotes a poor outcome. However, keep in mind that this sentence is quite short, and it lacks specific details about which aspects of filmmaking were unsatisfactory. A more thorough analysis would require a larger or more detailed review that elaborates on the reasoning behind the critique and whether any aspects of the movie were redeemable. Sentiment analysis is typically conducted on more extensive pieces of text to accurately gauge the overall feeling that the reviewer is conveying.

More delegates to the presidential nominating conventions can be won on Super Tuesday than on any other single day of the primary calendar. Since Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses are typically held in a large number of states from geographically and socially diverse regions of the country, it typically represents a presidential candidate's first test of national electability. Thus, candidates seeking the presidency traditionally must do well on this day to help secure their party's nomination. In fact, convincing wins in Super Tuesday primaries have usually propelled candidates to their party's nomination. Super Tuesday is in either February or March of the presidential election year. During the 2016 election year, Super Tuesday was held on March 1.  - The Potomac primary (named after the river that splits the region), also called Chesapeake Tuesday, the Beltway primary, and the Crabcake primary, is the confluence of three Democratic presidential primaries and three Republican presidential primaries that takes place after Super Tuesday.  - The 2008 Virginia Republican primary took place on February 12 , 2008 .

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  and the situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  Answer the following question: Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? A:","output":"Given the background information provided, PepsiCo supplies farmers with genetically modified organism (GMO) potato seeds, while Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds. One of the attributes of GMO crops is increased herbicide tolerance. This means that the GMO potatoes provided by PepsiCo would have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides like glyphosate, without suffering any harm. On the other hand, Kettle Foods' non-GMO potatoes would not have this specific gene modification, making them less likely to have the same level of herbicide tolerance as compared to the GMO potatoes supplied by PepsiCo. Therefore, it can be concluded that PepsiCo potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' potatoes."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Herb Kline","output":"Title: The Shadows of Herb Kline Genre: Crime/Thriller/Mystery Plot: Alex Turner, an ambitious detective with a tragic past, has just been assigned his first case after a long period of desk duties. A corpse under the name of Herb Kline is found in a seedy motel room, with no identification other than the registration card and the modest personal belongings inside the room. Clues scattered all over indicate that Herb's death wasn't an accident, but a well-planned murder. During his early investigations, Alex discovers that Herb Kline was a reporter who had recently vanished after revealing a corrupt senator's shady dealings. Although the senator is the primary suspect, his watertight alibi pushes Alex to broaden his search for the true perpetrator.  In an unexpected twist, surveillance footage reveals a woman named Emily Harris entering Herb's room on the night of the murder. Emily, a struggling artist, was in a tumultuous romantic relationship with Herb since their high-school days. Grappling with personal demons, she becomes the new prime suspect due to her erratic behavior and questionable past. As Alex delves further into the case, he finds an encrypted flash drive among Herb's personal belongings, containing damning evidence against a notorious criminal organization, The Serpents. Intrigued, Alex realizes that Herb was merely a pawn in a much larger, dangerous game. Forced to join forces with Emily, the two find themselves at the mercy of the merciless criminal organization.  Amid this chaos, Alex uncovers Herb's last project — exposing The Serpents' nefarious activities and bringing down their empire. Risking their lives, Alex and Emily embark on a relentless pursuit of justice for Herb, where every new lead unveils a dark and intricate web of deception. As the final act unfolds, the senator is revealed to be the leader of The Serpents, and he had orchestrated both Herb's murder and the seduction of Emily to use her as a scapegoat. Alex pieces together the final piece of the puzzle, and after a pulse-pounding chase, the film culminates in a heart-wrenching finale where the senator pays for his deeds at the hands of the law, and Alex and Emily emerge as unexpected allies.  The film concludes with Alex finally reconciling with his tragic past, finding solace in the friendship forged with Emily during their traumatic, yet transformative journey. The Shadows of Herb Kline is a story filled with shades of deceit, intrigue, and redemption. With a complex, labyrinthine narrative, it explores the idea that even in the darkest hour, the resilience of the human spirit can triumph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the voices are high-pitched, others deeper but unmistakably youthful — kids; their joyful noise fills the air. This is the sound every parent wants to hear: carefree, happy children. “We like to think we put a smile on someone’s face every time we get a win” —Newtown High running back Cooper Gold This is what’s going on now in Newtown, Conn., a town that’s ready to change the focus from last December, if only everyone would let it. The town that will be forever known as home to one of the nation’s worst mass shootings, when a gunman killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School nearly one year ago, is currently home to another story — one that is helping to lift the spirits of the people of the picturesque, All-American town and perhaps write a new history. Newtown High School’s football team stands a perfect 12-0 after a rain-soaked, run-fueled 42-7 drubbing of rival Masuk in its regular-season finale on Tuesday night. Newtown High running back Cooper Gold was unstoppable Tuesday night, running for 256 yards and five scores in less than three quarters of action in a 42-7 win over Masuk that capped an undefeated regular season. It gets better. Newtown High is ranked No. 1 in Class LL, the division where the state’s biggest schools reside. The Nighthawks are in the top 10 in the state in passing yards, having outscored their opposition 439-138. And Newtown will be the top seed in the state playoffs when they kick off next Tuesday with a home game against a team still to be determined. “We like to think we put a smile on someone’s face every time we get a win,” running back Cooper Gold said after rushing for 256 yards and five touchdowns in less than three quarters of playing time on Tuesday. “There’s a lot of good things going on here . . . that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.” —Newtown High head coach Steve George Cooper Gold. What an All-American name, right? Newtown is that kind of city, a quaint little postcard of a place that proudly flies a giant American flag high above the middle of its tree-lined Main Street. It’s the kind of town that Steve George has never wanted to leave. He is Newtown’s coach. He was born and raised there, and was part of Newtown’s last state championship football team in 1992. He’s now in his seventh year as head coach of the Nighthawks. “I’ve seen some great things happen in Newtown,” George said. “I sort of think that’s what we should be known for. There’s a lot of good things going on here. There’s a lot of great sports teams, there are great academics, and great things that go on in our schools that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.” One only need look to this week to realize the truth of those words. As Newtown’s football team writes a story that gains national attention, the Sandy Hook tragedy has boomeranged back into the public eye, too. On Monday, the day before Newtown’s final regular-season game, the Connecticut State Attorney’s official summary report on the shootings was released. On Tuesday, the day of the game, a judge ordered that the 911 calls from the shooting be made public. And if the team reaches its goal of the state championship game, it could take place on Dec. 14, the one-year anniversary of the massacre. With a perfect run through the regular season complete, the Newtown High football team now sets its sights on the playoffs, and a potential championship game on the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shootings. All of that seems unfair, but even when the reminders are not as obvious, as glaring, they are still there in some form, and in some instances, self-created. All season, for example, the Nighthawks have worn a helmet with a specially designed logo, which includes the number “26” as a tribute to the 26 victims killed in the massacre. The logo also contains green (Sandy Hook’s colors were green and white). Many fans taking in Tuesday’s game do so by filling up the visitor’s bleachers wearing jackets with green or white ribbons. “As much as we have a rivalry with Newtown, we’ve supported them in the tragedy they had to deal with, and we still do” —Dave Brennan, head coach of Newtown High rival Masuk High That Newtown’s final regular-season win would come in Monroe was in some ways fitting. Monroe is Newtown’s direct neighbor to the south, and its most hospitable one, as well — the town that rallied most swiftly to its side. When it was determined that the Sandy Hook Elementary School would be closed indefinitely, it was Monroe that volunteered the use of one of its campuses, Chalk Hill School, which had been closed the year before. Working quickly, students, employees and volunteers in the Monroe district rallied to prepare the building and make the sudden transplants feel at home. The school is still the temporary home of the students of Sandy Hook, less than 10 miles from the school they used to hold dear. Earlier this month, the Sandy Hook complex was demolished for good. A new school will soon rise in its place. “As much as we have a rivalry with Newtown, we’ve supported them in the tragedy they had to deal with, and we still do,” said Masuk coach Dave Brennan, whose team was eliminated from playoff contention with a 7-4 record. “Does it lessen the sting of a loss like this? Never. You always want to compete when you have a chance to play football, but this is what makes our sport so wonderful.” Rain was certainly in the air in Monroe on Tuesday night, but so was something else — the sound of laughter coming from the stands of the visiting Newtown High fans. To wit, when the clock expired, even the remaining Masuk faithful gave the victors a hand. Newtown is so small — about 28,000 at last count — that nearly every resident had some personal connection to the shooting, however indirect. While none of the football team’s players reportedly had any relation to victims of the tragedy, about 10-15 had gone to elementary school at Sandy Hook, as had two coaches. So on opening day in September, Newtown High officially dedicated the season to all that were lost that horrific morning, wearing green and white jerseys with “Sandy Hook” on the front and “Stay Strong” on the back. Eleven weeks later, they are still carrying on their promise to the 26. On a gray night that saw rain falling softly for all four quarters, the joy in that could not be understated. When Gold left the game for the last time with his team up 35-7, when the offensive line was allowed a rare moment in the spotlight while being replaced late in the fourth, when the defense gamely dug in for a goal-line stand while up 35 points, it was made clear that these were boys embracing the challenge of chasing a dream. These were kids, happy and full of hope. To a town still healing, it was a sight and sound more meaningful, more perfect than the numbers 12 and 0.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. No surprise there, as the SNP and pro-independence Greens have a majority at Holyrood. But the power to call a poll lies with Westminster - so the Holyrood parliament can press only for the start of negotiations about a date. The parliament has endorsed the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's preferred timetable suggesting a referendum would \\"most appropriately be between the autumn of 2018, when there is clarity over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and around the point at which the UK leaves the EU in spring 2019\\". The timing would have obvious advantages for the SNP - Theresa May would be distracted by Brexit and UK government departments would have little time to work on research designed to dent or destroy the economic case for independence. The prime minister and her advisers are all too aware of this - so what happens if Theresa May continues to dig her heels in and not only repeats \\"now is not that time\\" but suggests 2019 won't be the time either? Senior SNP sources dismiss the idea that, under these circumstances, Nicola Sturgeon will attempt to organise a 'consultative' referendum without Westminster agreement which would have no constitutional standing. So they will attempt to maintain pressure for a properly constituted, legally watertight referendum through sophisticated social media campaigning and - they hope - headline grabbing initiatives, such as declaring the economic case for independence is no longer reliant on oil revenues. According to her public statements, Nicola Sturgeon is suggesting there should only be a little bit of wriggle room on the timing of that referendum - \\"a bit beyond\\" Brexit. The reason for this is that the party's strategists have been conducting focus groups amongst those who firmly voted against independence last time. And they find that the timing argument is particularly resonant with those who voted No in the 2014 referendum and Remain in 2016. Hence you will hear Nicola Sturgeon use phrases such as having a vote \\"before it's too late\\" to appeal to this groupâ€¦though in reality, there seems little prospect of Scotland straightforwardly staying in the EU whenever a vote is held. Incidentally, she will also continue to use very warm words to describe the contribution made by EU citizens to Scotland as it is hoped that many of them will change their vote from No - because they had been worried an independent Scotland would have been out of the EU - to Yes. But privately the party's strategists are a little less concerned if the stated referendum timescale slips. Indeed, some relish the prospect. They see Theresa May as their not-so-secret weapon. SNP strategists believe that the longer Theresa May sets her face against a referendum after Brexit the more she will build support for independence. That's because they think some former No voters will object to her apparent disrespect for Scotland and be more open to the SNP's arguments that Westminster doesn't listen to the devolved Scottish parliament. And they point out they need just one in 20 voters to change their mind. The SNP manifesto made it clear there should be a second referendum either if there were \\"a significant and material change in circumstancesâ€¦such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\\" or  \\"if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option for a majority of the Scottish people\\". While only the first criterion has been met, it's the view of senior SNP figures that the longer the prime minister delays \\"Indyref2\\" the more likely it is that the party can meet both criteria. But there are dangers. The biggest fear is that Theresa May tries to push the timescale not just beyond Brexit but beyond the next Scottish parliament elections in 2021. Of course, this would be denounced by Nationalists as a constitutional outrage. But their private worry is that the SNP's mandate for a second referendum might run out. The party currently forms a minority administration despite being more popular than their nearest rivals in Scotland - now the Conservatives, not Labour - by a wide margin. And it would take only a collapse in the vote of their (essential) independence allies, the Greens, in 2021 to put the project in jeopardy. In part this explains the decision to go hammer and tongs for a referendum in this parliament - and even before some serious questions on the currency and the exact route back to the EU are settled. But there is another challenge. Again privately, there are concerns about how the party will hold onto Yes voters who backed Brexit. Any backsliding to appease them - settling for EEA membership, not full EU membership, for example - might in turn alienate the 'No-to-Yes Remainers'. Nicola Sturgeon will undoubtedly confront these difficulties with boldness. She has already ignored the advice of senior officials by calling for the second referendum before, and not after, Article 50 is triggered. She is rather good at making the political weather. But the polls suggest she hasn't yet changed the climate of Scottish public opinion. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The text is about Scotland's political party called the SNP and their leader Nicola Sturgeon. They want to have another vote to see if Scotland should be independent from the United Kingdom. There are some challenges and disagreements on when the vote should happen. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, wants it to happen later. Some people in Scotland would be unhappy if the vote happens very late. Nicola Sturgeon will have to make choices and find a way to make the vote happen.

Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine.

Paragraph: Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"Why does the Illinois Supreme Court want to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers?\\" Answer: \\"They want to increase the rates to give services to the poor and to help lawyers with drug and alcohol problems\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. The Illinois Supreme Court wants to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers to bolster pro-bono services, which provide legal assistance to the poor, and to support lawyers struggling with drug and alcohol problems. The fee hikes aim to address the declining revenues generated by the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which normally supports non-profit legal aid groups, but has been affected by low-interest rates and a sagging economy. By raising the registration fees, the high court intends to counter the shortfall in interest income and ensure that these essential services have adequate financial support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My best friend Rose and I used to dream about raising a family of our own someday and living next door to one another. Our dream remained alive through school and beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I married Dick. Later, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we moved. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. We remained in touch for a few years before we lost track. I thought of her several times over the years. All of my children now have families of their own, and Dick passed away a few years ago. Basically, a lifetime has passed. Then one day, near my 80th birthday, I received a phone call \\"Hi Natalie, it's Rose,\\" the voice on the other end said, \\" I don't know if you remember me, but we used to be best friends in Jamaica Plain when we were kids.\\" We have spent hours on the phone catching up. Even after 52 years of separation our personalities and interests are still extremely similar. We both share a passion for several hobbies that we each picked up independently several years after we lost touch with one another. It almost feels like we are picking up right where we left off.

In 1602 O'Neill destroyed his capital at Dungannon due to the approach of Mountjoy's forces, and withdrew to hide in the woods. In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords  began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian Óg O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\".  - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred.  - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance.  - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 .  - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles.  - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age  until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom.  - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris.  - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\".  - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

La vena cava superior es un importante vaso sanguíneo que se encarga de transportar la sangre sin oxígeno, que proviene de la parte superior del cuerpo humano, de vuelta al corazón. Esta sangre se ha utilizado en los tejidos y órganos de la parte superior del cuerpo, y una vez que ha entregado su oxígeno y nutrientes, necesita ser bombeada de nuevo al corazón para recoger más oxígeno y nutrientes y continuar con su circulación. La sangre desoxigenada llega a la vena cava superior a través de las venas subclavias y las venas yugulares internas, que drenan la sangre del cuello, la cabeza y los brazos. A medida que estos vasos sanguíneos se unen, forman la vena cava superior, que se localiza en el mediastino superior, cerca de la base del corazón. La vena cava superior se desplaza hacia abajo y se fusiona con la aurícula derecha del corazón, que es la cámara superior derecha del órgano. Desde aquí, la sangre fluye hacia el ventrículo derecho, donde es bombeada a los pulmones para recoger oxígeno antes de regresar al corazón y ser enviada nuevamente a todas las partes del cuerpo. Las venas en el sistema circulatorio humano tienen la función específica de transportar la sangre de regreso al corazón, y la vena cava superior es una de las dos venas más grandes en el cuerpo, siendo la otra la vena cava inferior. Juntas, la vena cava superior e inferior, drenan la sangre desoxigenada de todo el cuerpo para asegurar su correcta circulación y para mantener un funcionamiento adecuado de todos los órganos y sistemas del cuerpo.

How can I protect a cell phone from the rain?","output":"Protecting your cell phone from rain is crucial, as water can cause severe damage to your device, impacting both its functionality and efficiency. To protect your cell phone from rain, you may consider implementing some of the following steps and precautions: 1. Invest in a waterproof case: Waterproof cases are designed specifically to protect your phone from water damage. Choose a case with a high water resistance rating, such as an IP67 or IP68 rating, which means the case is capable of withstanding water immersion for certain periods of time. There is a wide variety of waterproof cases available, ranging from slim designs to more rugged options that also offer drop and shock protection. 2. Use a ziplock bag: In the absence of a waterproof case, consider using a ziplock bag as a temporary solution. Place your phone inside the bag and ensure it's completely sealed. While this won't allow for full functionality, it will protect the phone from direct contact with water. 3. DIY waterproof pouch: You can also create your waterproof pouch using some waterproof material, such as TPU or PVC fabric, and then adding a waterproof closure system, such as a waterproof zipper or Velcro strips. Ensure that the pouch is sized to fit your phone and provides a reliable seal against water. 4. Avoid using the phone in heavy rain: If possible, avoid using your cell phone during heavy rainstorms. Wait until you are indoors or under shelter to use your device. If you must use your phone, try to shield it under an umbrella or any other waterproof barrier while you're making calls, texting, or using the touchscreen. 5. Keep your phone in an inner pocket: When walking in the rain, store your phone in an inner pocket of your coat or bag to shield it from direct exposure to rain. A waterproof backpack or shoulder bag can add extra protection. 6. Use a Bluetooth headset or earphones: If you need to make calls during the rain, use a Bluetooth headset or wired earphones to avoid exposing your phone to the rain directly. This helps you keep your phone safe inside the waterproof case or ziplock bag, while still being able to communicate hands-free. 7. Dry your phone immediately if it gets wet: If your phone gets wet, immediately power it off and wipe it down with a soft, dry cloth. Remove the battery, if possible, and avoid using any devices with wet ports or connectors. You can also place your phone in a container with uncooked rice or silica gel packets to absorb any water that may have penetrated the device. Allow it to dry for at least 24-48 hours before attempting to turn it back on. 8. Invest in a waterproof phone: If you often find yourself in situations where your phone is exposed to rain, you may want to consider purchasing a phone with built-in waterproof features. Many modern smartphones have water resistance ratings and can withstand a certain extent of exposure to water. By employing some or all of these measures, you can effectively protect your cell phone from rain and minimize the risk of water damage. Always remember that prevention is better than repair when it comes to safeguarding your device against water-related damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Process:  - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more calm waters happens, how will it affect there is less current in the sea.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more calm waters would have an indirect effect on the process.  Step-by-step analysis:  1. If the waters are calmer, there will be less energy in the waves. 2. When there is less energy in the waves, they will carry less sediment from the ocean and hit the beach with less force. 3. With less forceful impact on the rocks and sand, the wind and current will not push the water and particles as hard. 4. Since tiny parts of the rocks are chipped off with less force, fewer small rocks and sand particles will be broken off from larger rocks. 5. The waves will still pick up sand and small rocks from the beach, but in smaller amounts due to the reduced energy. 6. The waves will continue to go back out into the ocean, carrying the new particles, but the overall process will be slower and less noticeable. 7. As a result, the rocks and the beach will look slightly different, but the changes will be less significant and occur at a slower rate compared to a situation with more energetic waters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film \\"The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh\\" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller, \\"The Case of the Scorpion's Tail.\\" Like his earlier effort, this one stars handsome macho dude George Hilton, who would go on to star in Martino's Satanic/giallo hybrid \\"All the Colors of the Dark\\" the following year. \\"Scorpion's Tail\\" also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would go on to portray an unhappy couple (to put it mildly!) in Martino's \\"Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key\\" (1972). (I just love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot this! Anyway, this film boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans would expect, as well as a twisty plot, some finely done murder set pieces, and beautiful Athenian location shooting. The story this time concerns an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like Farrah Fawcett's prettier, smarter sister) who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of 1 million by a beautiful widow. I really thought I had this picture figured out halfway through, but I was dead wrong. Although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo, I may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. Highlights of the picture, for me, were Anita's cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end, a particularly suspenseful house break-in, and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie!

Question: I have a new situation: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering.  But I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  What is an answer for this question: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","output":"The blood vessels in Karen's right arm are more dilated, as indicated by the redness and visibility of the cut.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What two groups made up the typical ballet audience? is inside the article: At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions   began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ...

I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots . Somewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me. I meet and talk with interesting people along the way. Enjoying beautiful scenes, meeting wild animals(usually at my camping site), and traveling up and down hills also make me cheerful.

The extensive menu offered a diverse range of exquisite dishes, making it hard to choose, but our attentive server, Mary, was more than helpful with her recommendations. To start, we shared the flavorsome wild mushroom risotto, which turned out to be the perfect choice. The creaminess and depth of flavors with each bite were mouth-watering, and the fresh herbs added a clean note to the dish. Next, we opted for the pan-seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection. The delicate balance between the golden crust, tender scallops, and the zesty lemon-garlic sauce was simply divine. For our main courses, I tried the succulent, slow-cooked beef short rib, which melted in my mouth and was neatly paired with a gorgeous red wine jus and seasonal vegetables. My partner had the pan-roasted salmon with a delightful citrus beurre blanc sauce. The salmon was cooked flawlessly, with the right balance of flavors. The wine menu was quite impressive, showcasing a wide selection of local and international varieties to cater to all preferences. Our server helped us choose a bottle of red wine that complemented our meal beautifully. Now, I cannot possibly review Le Gourmet Bistro without mentioning the heavenly dessert. I indulged in the chocolate lava cake, a decadent masterpiece with its rich, gooey center and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. My partner savored the light and fruity mixed berry pavlova, which had a perfect balance of sweetness and tangy notes. From the attentive, personable service to the carefully crafted dishes and impressive wine selection, our experience at Le Gourmet Bistro was an absolute delight. The attention to detail in the presentation and the explosion of flavors in each dish showcased the genuine love and passion for fine cuisine coming from the talented chefs. I cannot wait to return to Le Gourmet Bistro for another unforgettable dining experience! Highly recommend – a well-deserved 5-star rating!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might he got for more? - windows 95 - school - ammunition shop - office supply store - desk  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Sam ran out of clipboards. Where might he go for more?\\" is the option \\"office supply store.\\"  Going into detail, the rationale behind choosing the office supply store as the best option is straightforward. Office supply stores are known for carrying a diverse range of items that are specifically designed for office, educational, and organizational use. These stores stock various products such as paper, pens, pencils, folders, binders, staplers, desk organizers, printing supplies, and, most importantly, clipboards. If Sam needs to urgently replenish his stock of clipboards, the office supply store is the most logical and reliable place to find them. The store will likely carry different types and sizes of clipboards. Whether Sam needs a small clipboard for holding notepads or a larger one for hefty stacks of papers, the office supply store will undoubtedly have what he is looking for. Now, let's explore why the other options listed are not the best choices for Sam to obtain more clipboards: 1. Windows 95: Windows 95 is an operating system developed by Microsoft, released in 1995. It is a piece of software designed to manage a computer's hardware and software resources, and it has no connection to providing physical items like clipboards. Consequently, it is not a valid option for Sam's situation. 2. School: While it is true that schools often have clipboards for various purposes like classroom instruction, presentations, and administrative tasks, Sam might not have direct access to these supplies. Schools usually purchase clipboards in bulk for their specific needs and may not sell them individually to students or external individuals. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate for Sam to take clipboards from a school, as those items belong to the institution. 3. Ammunition shop: An ammunition shop primarily focuses on selling firearms and related accessories. While it is possible that such a store might incidentally carry a clipboard or two for inventory management or documentation purposes, it is highly unlikely that an ammunition shop would have a proper stock of clipboards for sale. Therefore, it is not an ideal place for Sam to find the clipboards he needs. 4. Desk: A desk may occasionally have a clipboard or two lying around, but it is not a place where one can expect to find or purchase new clipboards consistently. Rather, a desk is meant for organizing and storing work materials, not providing a steady supply of clipboards. In conclusion, when considering all the options presented, the office supply store stands out as the most practical and reliable choice for Sam to obtain more clipboards. The store specializes in providing a wide range of office and organizational supplies, which will cater precisely to Sam's needs, whereas the other options are either irrelevant or unlikely to offer an adequate selection of clipboards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

Thats why you want to eat right and get plenty of sleep. You need a strong immune system to fight off illness. Plants dont have an immune system. That does not mean they do not get sick. Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues.   Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic.  Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain.

Former model Maria Wyeth, who comes from a Nevada town with a population of 28, is now a successful actress. But she is unhappily married to, and separated from, temperamental producer Carter Lang and also chronically depressed and institutionalized. Reflecting back on what brought her here, Maria recalls driving around Los Angeles in her yellow Chevrolet Corvette and spending time with her closest friend, B.Z. Mendenhall, an unhappy man who is gay. Maria has a brain-damaged daughter, Kate, who is being kept in a sanitarium at the insistence of Carter, who resents Maria visiting the girl so frequently. Maria's secret desire is to live somewhere with Kate and find some kind of joy in life together. Maria has been having an affair with Les Goodwin, a screenwriter. When she tells Carter she is pregnant, he demands she get an abortion. Maria goes to Las Vegas and has a fling with a mob-connected lawyer, Larry Kulik, and later returns to L.A. and has a one-night stand with Johnny Waters, a television star who needs to watch his own show on TV to get in the mood. Bored and depressed, Maria steals Johnny's car and speeds off. When she is stopped by police, drugs are found in the car and she is placed under arrest. Her spirits at an all-time low, Maria returns to Las Vegas and finds that B.Z. is equally unhappy. When he swallows a handful of pills and washes them down with vodka, rather than call for help, Maria cradles him and watches him die.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Which is safer --- staying at home, traveling to work on public transport, or working at the office? Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production  going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

However, one industry watcher suggested there had been talk of an internal \\"war\\" between Mr Sinofsky and chief executive Steve Ballmer.

He added that many observers saw Mr Sinofsky as a potential successor to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive. In a letter to all employees, published by Forbes, Mr Sinofsky set out to quell the rumours about his departure. \\"Some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing. I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read - about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership,\\" he said.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Over the past few months, she had accumulated enough savings to finally buy the handbags she had been eyeing for so long. Knowing her taste in fashion and her penchant for bargains, Tanya made sure to pick the ones that were both stylish and cost-effective, striking a balance between her desire for luxury and her practical nature. On the other hand, Christine had also saved her money with a specific goal in mind. However, her priorities were a little different from Tanya's. Christine had been working hard to save her money to treat herself to a relaxing and rejuvenating spa day. She knew the importance of self-care and believed that it would benefit her mental and physical well-being greatly. While she did appreciate the beauty of the handbags Tanya purchased, Christine felt that her savings would be better spent on an experience that could help her recharge and refocus her energies.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  and the situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin.  Answer the following question: In which case melanocytes would produce less melanin, case D or case L? The answer to this question is:","output":"In case L (lighter skin), melanocytes would produce less melanin. People with lighter skin have melanocytes that produce a lower amount of melanin, while people with darker skin (case D) have melanocytes that produce a higher amount of melanin.

Translate to English","output":"Should the offered goods be sold out, the promotion will end prematurely. In this sentence, the original German text mentions that if the goods available in a promotional offer are sold out, the promotion will come to an early or unexpected end. In the translation to English, the sentence is rendered in a way that keeps the same essential meaning while ensuring that it reads smoothly and coherently for an English-speaking audience. In order to further understand the broader context of the given sentence, we can analyze each of its components: 1. \\"Sollten die angebotenen Waren ausverkauft sein\\" (Should the offered goods be sold out) - This part of the sentence refers to a situation in which all available goods that are part of a promotion or special offer are sold out, leaving no more inventory available for customers. This could be the case if the demand for these items was higher than anticipated or if the available stock was limited. 2. \\"endet die Aktion vorzeitig\\" (the promotion will end prematurely) - The second part of the sentence explains the consequences of the situation described in the first part. Since there are no more goods available for the promotion, the promotion will end earlier than planned or expected. This can happen when a promotion is highly successful, and customers quickly take advantage of the offer, or when the available stock happens to not be sufficient to meet the demand during the entire duration of the promotion. From this analysis, the English translation captures the essence of the German sentence, conveying the same intended meaning while ensuring clarity and coherence for English-speaking readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, we can extract several pieces of data: 1. A person named Ranil Wickremesinghe: The sentence mentions an individual named Ranil Wickremesinghe, identifying him as a notable figure. 2. Leadership position: The sentence states that Ranil Wickremesinghe holds a leadership position within Tamil speaking Sri Lanka. However, it does not specify the precise role or title (e.g., Prime Minister, President, or a political party leader). 3. Tamil speaking Sri Lanka: The phrase \\"Tamil speaking Sri Lanka\\" indicates a specific region or community within Sri Lanka where the Tamil language is predominantly spoken. This could refer to the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka or a broader population of Tamil speakers within the country. 4. Adisham Hall: The sentence mentions a place called \\"Adisham Hall.\\" Based on the context, Adisham Hall appears to be a significant landmark or building located within the area where Ranil Wickremesinghe leads. Given this sentence alone, it is difficult to deduce the context and chronological order of the data extracted. However, some possible connections and additional information can be considered: - Ranil Wickremesinghe might be currently holding or have previously held a political position that directly impacts or represents the Tamil speaking population of Sri Lanka. - Adisham Hall may be a culturally or politically significant site for the Tamil speaking communities or for the leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, himself. - The mention of these specific details could imply that Tamil language, culture, or politics play a substantial role in the surrounding context of this sentence. To have a better understanding of the extracted data and its significance, further context and research are needed. Additional information about Ranil Wickremesinghe's political career, Tamil speaking regions in Sri Lanka, and the history or purpose of Adisham Hall will help in providing a more complete understanding of the data's implications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We will do this step by step. Step 1: Combine like terms (constants). -121993 + 25764 - 4338 = -121993 + (25764 - 4338)                  = -121993 + 21426                  = -100567 Now, our equation becomes: -1501*i - 100567 = 0 Step 2: Isolate i. To isolate i, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation: -1501*i = 100567 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of i. Finally, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -1501: i = 100567 / -1501 Step 4: Calculate the value of i. i ≈ -66.999 Hence, the solution for i is approximately -66.999."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman listened to music on the radio instead of her phone because the","output":"The woman listened to music on the radio instead of her phone because the experience provided her with a sense of nostalgia and connection to the world around her that she found lacking while using her phone. To further understand her decision, it is important to understand the various factors that contribute to the experience of listening to music on the radio as opposed to a phone. 1. Sense of Nostalgia: For many people, listening to radio can remind them of times when technology was not as advanced and they spent their days listening to their favorite stations and discovering new music. Many individuals might have fond memories associated with listening to the radio – road trips, late-night study sessions, or time spent with family and friends. For the woman in the sentence, the nostalgia factor might have played a significant role in her choice to listen to the radio rather than her phone. 2. Curated Content: One of the great aspects of radio stations is that they are often curated by knowledgeable DJs, who may have a good understanding of the music scene and a passion for sharing great tunes. They have the ability to create an unexpected and exciting listening experience, with tracks that the listener might have never heard before or had forgotten about. With streaming services on phones, users typically have to actively search for new music, and algorithms may limit their exposure to different genres and artists outside their frequently played tracks. 3. Connection to the World: Tuning into a radio station allows the listener to feel a sense of connection, as they know that others are simultaneously listening to the same music. The DJs' chatter about local events, news and announcements enhances this connection, as the listener can feel more involved in their community. Moreover, radio stations often unite people from diverse backgrounds, creating a shared experience. In comparison, listening to music on a phone may feel more isolating, as the experience is more personalized and doesn't evoke the same community feeling. 4. Limited Control: When listening to the radio, one is at the mercy of the station and DJ's playlist, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. Limited control can lead to a sense of anticipation as well as surprise when a beloved song is played. This can be a refreshing change from the instant gratification that smartphones provide, where users have the ability to skip songs, create personalized playlists and hand-pick their favorite tracks. 5. Cost and Accessibility: Finally, one cannot ignore the practical aspect of listening to the radio. Tuning into a station is free and requires no internet connection, making it more accessible to a wider audience. The simplicity of turning on a radio and effortlessly enjoying music without the need for data plans, subscriptions or battery power may have enticed the woman to choose this option over her phone. In conclusion, the woman's choice to listen to music on the radio instead of her phone is influenced by factors such as nostalgia, the curated content provided by radio stations, connection to the world and the community around her, the thrill of limited control and the cost and accessibility of radio. The experience of listening to the radio can evoke emotions and a sense of connection that may be lacking when listening to music through a smartphone, and people may choose this option as a deliberate and conscious break from a technology-driven world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead.

There are lots of differences between children's lives in cities and those in villages. The biggest difference is independence. Hu's team said that 60 percent of city kids couldn't do much housework, but 90 percent of village kids could care for themselves. City kids told Hu they cared about school a lot, and they had no time for washing clothes or making their beds. Village kids said they helped their parents with housework a lot. They cooked, did some cleaning and fed animals. Hu's team also found that village kids had less pocket money  . Many never used computers. They played in rivers or on mountains.

Joseph Anthony Pereira (born September 10, 1950), better known by his stage name Joe Perry, is the lead guitarist, backing and occasional lead vocalist, and contributing songwriter for the American rock band Aerosmith. He was ranked 84th in Rolling Stone's list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Aerosmith, and in 2013, Perry and his songwriting partner Steven Tyler were recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award and were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2014, Simon & Schuster released Rocks: During Perry's early years he formed a band with Tom Hamilton called The Jam Band. Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer eventually joined them and the band became Aerosmith. While initially dismissed as The Rolling Stones knock-offs, the band came into its own during the mid-1970s with a string of hit records. Chief among these successes were Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976), thanks largely to the prevalence of free-form, album-oriented FM radio. The group also managed hit singles on the radio with songs like \\"Dream On\\", \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\", \\"Sweet Emotion\\", \\"Walk This Way\\", \\"Back in the Saddle\\", and \\"Last Child\\".  During this time, Perry and Tyler became known as the \\"Toxic Twins\\" for their notorious hard-partying and drug use. Aerosmith's crowd earned the nickname \\"The Blue Army\\", so called by the band after the seemingly endless number of teenagers in the audience wearing blue denim jackets and blue jeans. The audience was abundantly male with long hair.  Following Rocks, the group began to stumble. Drug use escalated and the creative process became hampered by strained relationships within the band. This was highlighted during the recording process for their next album, which was recorded at an abandoned convent in upstate New York. During their time there, Tyler and Perry would spend much of the time in their rooms getting high, away from the rest of the band, and would often record their parts separately. The band, hampered by heavy drug use and distracted by hobbies such as driving fast cars on the nearby parkways and shooting high-powered firearms in the building's attic, struggled to come up with material. Draw the Line, released in 1977, became a hit nonetheless, going double Platinum. However, it was not as successful as their prior efforts, with the singles \\"Draw the Line\\" and \\"Kings and Queens\\" both charting in the Hot 100, but failing to crack the Top 40. On the album, Perry sang lead vocals on the track \\"Bright Light Fright\\". The band toured throughout 1977 and 1978 in support of the album, but increasing violence at concerts (such as bottles, cherry bombs, M-80s, and firecrackers being thrown on-stage, including several notorious incidents at The Spectrum in Philadelphia) as well as the band's heavy drug use began to mar the performances. In 1978, Aerosmith released the live collection Live! Bootleg, released the stand-alone single \\"Chip Away the Stone\\", and starred as \\"The Future Villain Band\\" in the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. For the film, the band released a cover of The Beatles' \\"Come Together\\", which would become the band's last Top 40 hit for nearly a decade.

Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose  is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious  attempt on the part of the liar to... Question: Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage as a sign of lying ?

And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this? Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then. If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \\"What a good exam that was!\\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product they purchased based on their expectations. Their disappointment primarily stems from not being aware of the different types of remastering available for the original recording. They ended up with the version that has only 2 parts instead of 4, which they believe does not justify the amount they paid for it. Several factors contribute to the negative tone of the review: 1. Confusion: The reviewer did not realize the distinctions between the available types of remastering, implying that this information was not well-communicated or well-understood. 2. Disappointment: The reviewer's expectations were not met because the version they acquired only contained 2 parts instead of the 4 they expected. 3. Financial dissatisfaction: The reviewer feels that the money they spent on the product was not justified, considering the incomplete nature of the remastered version they acquired. 4. Implicit comparison: The mention of two different types of remastering may indicate that the reviewer believes the other version with 4 parts would have been worth the money, amplifying the negative tone.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free.

Raziel-Naor's political career began with her involvement in the Herut party from 1949 to 1965. Herut was a nationalist political party in Israel that emerged from the Revisionist Zionist movement, a faction that sought a Jewish state in the entirety of Mandatory Palestine. During her tenure with the Herut party, she advocated for a strong and independent Israel, focusing on issues such as security, economy, and immigration. This period marked the beginning of her political journey and helped her establish a reputation as a dedicated leader. In 1965, Raziel-Naor transitioned to the Gahal party, where she was an active member until 1974. Gahal was an Israeli political alliance formed by the merger of the Herut party and the Liberal Party. She continued her political activism and leadership within the Gahal party, where her experience, dedication, and ability to address various issues contributed to the party's growth. Gahal became one of the dominant right-wing political forces in Israel during its existence, and Raziel-Naor's involvement significantly shaped the party's trajectory. Throughout her political career, Raziel-Naor became known for her steadfast commitment to Israel's development and the realization of the Zionist ideal. She actively participated in various parliamentary committees, ensuring that her voice and the interests of the people she represented were heard. Her diligent work and passion for her country earned her the respect of her contemporaries and a well-deserved place in Israel's political history. Esther Raziel-Naor passed away on November 11, 2002, at the age of 90. Her long-standing political career and legacy continue to influence and inspire future generations of political leaders and activists in Israel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

Please answer the following question: Question: What did The Bears do at the end of the movie? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bad News Bears Context: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important.

It has unraveled at breakneck speed, as Russia moved against Ukraine, effectively annexed part of its territory, and put its smaller neighbor on the brink of war. Moving from disbelief to dismay to horror, Europeans lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that Russia was a predictable and cooperative partner. Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now. However far-fetched they may seem, these comparisons reflect a frantic search among Western politicians and experts for the underlying causes, rationales and consequences of Russia's actions in Ukraine.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the name of the orchestra Boult worried would be placed in serious financial jeopardy should Russell remain in post? is inside the article: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on..., can you guess it ?

He's a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn't get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense?Okay, keep your answer in mind.The next question is for supporters of President Obama. Let's say your political views map closely to the President's positions. He's your guy. But suppose you found out he once killed an American citizen in the United States to help his reelection. And assume, as with the CEO example, that the facts of the killing are undisputed and the President found a legal means to avoid prosecution. In that hypothetical case, would you still vote for President Obama? Or would you say it is a firing offense for a President to kill a citizen to advance his career?I predict that every one of you favored firing the hypothetical CEO for killing a guy to get ahead. My second prediction is that every Republican reader of this blog favored firing President Obama in the hypothetical and imaginary case of him murdering a citizen to get elected. My third prediction is that supporters of President Obama will quibble with the hypothetical example, or my comparison to the CEO, or say President Obama is still a better option than Romney. In other words, for most supporters of President Obama, I don't think there is such a thing as a \\"firing offense.\\"For the record, President Obama did not technically kill anyone to get elected. That was just a hypothetical example. But he is putting an American citizen in jail for 10 years to life for operating medical marijuana dispensaries in California where it is legal under state law. And I assume the President - who has a well-documented history of extensive marijuana use in his youth - is clamping down on California dispensaries for political reasons, i.e. to get reelected. What other reason could there be?One could argue that the President is just doing his job and enforcing existing Federal laws. That's the opposite of what he said he would do before he was elected, but lying is obviously not a firing offense for politicians.Personally, I'd prefer death to spending the final decades of my life in prison. So while President Obama didn't technically kill a citizen, he is certainly ruining this fellow's life, and his family's lives, and the lives of countless other minor drug offenders. And he is doing it to advance his career. If that's not a firing offense, what the hell is?Romney is likely to continue the same drug policies as the Obama administration. But he's enough of a chameleon and a pragmatist that one can't be sure. And I'm fairly certain he'd want a second term. He might find it \\"economical\\" to use federal resources in other ways than attacking California voters. And he is vocal about promoting states' rights, so he's got political cover for ignoring dispensaries in states where medical marijuana is legal.So while I don't agree with Romney's positions on most topics, I'm endorsing him for president starting today. I think we need to set a minimum standard for presidential behavior, and jailing American citizens for political gain simply has to be a firing offense no matter how awesome you might be in other ways.: Congratulations to Politico for being the first to take this post out of context.

A key factor in his decision, wrote cartoonist Scott Adams, is what he described as President Barack Obama’s role in a ruling in federal court to send to prison a California man who operates a medical marijuana dispensary, with a sentence between 10 years and life.

Rancho Cucamonga resident Aaron Sandusky was convicted in a federal court Friday of two marijuana-related counts. The first is conspiracy to manufacture marijuana plants and maintain a drug-involved premises. The second count is possession of marijuana plants with intent to distribute -- which essentially means he was running a pot shop, notes LA Weekly. On each count, the jury found that Sandusky had worked with at least 1,000 marijuana plants.      Sandusky, 41, faces a minimum of 10 years to life in prison. He was taken into custody after the trial and the sentencing hearing is scheduled for Jan. 2013.      The charges stem from Sandusky's three medical marijuana collectives, known as \\"G3 Holisitic,\\" in the Inland Empire cities of Upland, Colton and Moreno Valley. The U.S. attorney's office had sent Sandusky letters in Oct. 2011 warning him that the stores were violating federal law, and in response Sandusky closed two of them.      The next month, federal agents raided the remaining store, in Upland, twice. They seized marijuana plants and 11,500 in cash, effectively wiping out Sandusky's entire business.      The conviction at the federal court level is a blow to the medical marijuana community in California, some of whom have been supporting Sandusky through a website raising money for his legal defense.      His case also underscores the contrast between California -- which recognizes the medicinal properties of pot and protects marijuana dispensaries -- and federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal controlled substance with no accepted medical use.      Federalism issues didn't come into play during the trial, which Zach Weissmueller, a writer for libertarian magazine Reason, believes weakened Sandusky's case. In a blog for Reason, Weissmueller writes:      The federal government was successful in quelling any discussion of medical marijuana laws, federalism, or jury nullification--all of which were specters looming over the case when they discussed it in open court while jurors were not present. In closing statements, the federal prosecutors were sure to emphasize to jurors that personal feelings, political beliefs, and morals do not matter. The law is the law. One prosecutor instructed the jury \\"not to debate the law, but to apply the law.\\" If there was one important takeaway from the prosecution's closing, it was this phrase, emblazoned on one of their presentational slides: \\"Factual determination, not moral judgment.\\"      Another point of contention during the trial was the fact that the judge did not allow Sandusky to claim entrapment based on President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's public statements on medical marijuana.      Throughout his first campaign, Obama had said he wouldn't use federal resources to circumvent state laws about medical marijuana. During a 2009 press conference, Holder followed up on that promise, saying that federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries would be coming to an end unless the shops violated both state and federal law.      Sandusky had been charged along with five others who worked at G3, all of whom took plea deals and avoided a trial. During the course of the trial, G3 co-founder and owner John Leslie Nuckolls II, one of the men charged, admitted to having worked for the county District Attorney's Office and the DEA, reports the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.      In an August interview with ReasonTV (video above), Sandusky had called the conflict between California medical marijuana laws and federal drug laws a \\"constitutional battle\\" and vowed to defend the 10th Amendment right for states to pass their own laws. \\"If I have to go to jail for 20 years defending it, then so be it,\\" said Sandusky. \\"If a jury finds me guilty of violating federal law, then I'll go do the time.\\" ||||| Dilbert creator Scott Adams, last seen blaming society for being cruel to rapists and defending a chain email depicting President Obama as a chimpanzee, has now, appropriately enough, endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Coming, as it does, on the same day as the big Dennis Miller endorsement, it appears that Team Romney has now completely locked down the White Guys Who Laughed In 1993 demographic.      While Adams’ endorsement is no surprise (other than the accompanying fact that Dilbert still exists), nor is it really news, his “logic” is worth more laughs than his comic strip ever was.      First, some background. There are things called “newspapers” that are like a whole bunch of websites printed on paper, and in these newspapers are things called “comic strips.” Many of them are for kids, but there have been, like, three (The Far Side, Bloom County, Doonesbury, did I miss any?) funny ones for adults. Dilbert is one of the other kind, and it’s creator, Scott Adams, is a model citizen of entitled white male America. Like a lot of these guys, Adams gets his librul on when it comes to his own right to smoke weed or do whatever the eff he wants (aka “Libertarianism”), but gets all Republican-y when it comes time to pay for the society that protects and promotes his privileges.      Thus, the premise of Adams’ endorsement is that President Obama has been too tough on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Mitt Romney will be better because he sucks so much. Or something like that. Also, the President kinda killed a guy, but not really. But he totally killed a guy:      Let’s say a CEO does a great job for stockholders; he increases profits five-fold, treats the employees well, and causes the stock price to skyrocket. He’s a superstar. One day the public learns that the CEO killed a guy to get ahead in his career, but the CEO doesn’t get convicted because his clever attorney gets him off on a technicality. Assume in this hypothetical situation that the public correctly believes the CEO killed a guy to advance his career. Should the board of directors allow the superstar CEO to keep his job? Or is killing a guy to advance your career always a firing offense?      Well, the President didn’t kill a guy, but he did allow federal agents to enforce federal drug laws, which is kinda the same thing. Adams reasons that President Obama should be fired for enforcing laws that people like Mitt Romney will never allow to be changed. I don’t like the President’s record on medical marijuana, but in my imaginary business, I don’t fire the guy who killed one dude so I can hire Hannibal Lecter.

Given the following context:  With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.  During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.

Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give \\"Les Bleus\\" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. \\"I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,\\" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. \\"Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,\\" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. \\"They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win.\\" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. \\"I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,\\" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. \\"The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.\\" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. \\"They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,\\" he said. \\"It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.\\" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain  for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. \\"The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,\\" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. \\"Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,\\" it said. \\"The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match.\\" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. \\"He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,\\" the defender said. \\"FIFA will probably be happy.

Write some highlights for the following article: An American student is in critical condition after undergoing two operations after chimpanzees tore at his body in front of tourists at a South African animal sanctuary, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. Andrew Oberle, a primatology student from the University of Texas at San Antonio, was being treated at a Johannesburg hospital after two chimps attacked him Thursday, spokeswoman Robyn Baard said. \\"He went though a 6-hour procedure of which doctors cleaned out his wounds and now it's a case of wait and see, and just to keep him sedated and comfortable for now,\\" she said. Oberle had been at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimp Eden since May, according to Eugene Cussons, the facility's managing director. Oberle was at the sanctuary, near Nelspruit, South Africa, for the second time after training and volunteering there in 2010. His training included an explanation about \\"no-go\\" areas, spaces for animals where people are not supposed to go. Witnesses to the attack said that Oberle went into a no-go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around, Cussons told CNN. Oberle crossed one barrier and approached a second one, which is a main fence with 24 strands of electrical wiring, Cussons said. Two male chimps grabbed Oberle and tried to drag him under the fence, but were not able to yank him into their enclosure. Zookeeper killed by wolves in Sweden. Cussons said he estimates the attack lasted 15 minutes. At some point, people tried to stop the chimps, and Cussons shot two rounds in the air to see if that might get them to retreat, he said. One of the chimps then charged at Cussons, he said. Cussons shot that chimp in the abdomen, he told CNN, and it seemed to shriek as a kind of signal to other chimps that there was a more powerful threat present. The chimps then backed off, he said. Oberle was rescued and transported for medical care. None of the 13 tourists, most of them from local areas, were harmed, officials said. The chimp that was shot had an operation at the Johannesburg zoo to repair damage to his small and large intestines. Hospital spokeswoman Baard declined to discuss the nature of Oberle's wounds. She said the student's parents had requested privacy, adding that they are \\"quite traumatized.\\" The sanctuary, which is featured in the Animal Planet program \\"Escape to Chimp Eden,\\" remains closed and its staff is receiving counseling, executive director David Oosthuizen said. There are no plans right now to euthanize the chimps involved in the attack, said Dries Pienaar, who is leading the investigation into the incident. He works for a parks agency that makes sure zoos, sanctuaries and breeding projects comply with the law. Pienaar told CNN that his preliminary findings are that human error is to blame, but he cautioned that his investigation is not complete and that he wants to interview Oberle. He hasn't spoken to all of the tourists yet, either. Chimp Eden was established as a home for rescued chimpanzees. Many of the primates have suffered \\"horrible injuries and abuse from humans,\\" according to the sanctuary. Neville Pillay, head of animal behavior at Wits University, said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual. \\"Chimpanzees are known to be violent, and they can kill other animals. And male chimpanzees are particularly strong,\\" he said. Dave Salmoni, an expert in large predators for Animal Planet, said abused and captive chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous, likening the chimps to troubled prison inmates. \\"Now this is a very nice prison, but it's a prison nonetheless,\\" he said Monday. \\"And that's why you can see a lot of acting out behavior, and in some cases, with chimpanzees, they act out just because they can.\\" Oberle was passionate about studying chimpanzees, his friend Anthony Reimherr told CNN affiliate KXAN. He said it was \\"intriguing\\" to listen to Oberle when he spoke about the animals. \\"It's just something that he loved to do, and I think it's something that he'll always continue to do,\\" Reimherr said.

Information:  - Constantine Manasses ( Greek :   ; c. 1130 - c. 1187 ) was a Byzantine chronicler who flourished in the 12th century during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos ( 1143 - 1180 ) . He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates ( 1081 ) , sponsored by Irene Komnene , the emperor 's sister - in - law . It consists of about 7000 lines in the so - called political verse . It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation ; it was also translated into Bulgarian and Roman Slavic in the 14th century and enjoyed a great popularity . Chronicle edition : Bekker , Bonn 1837 ; the Bulgarian translation , by Bogdan and Bianu ( \`\` Cronica lui Constantin Manasses ) , Bucarest , 1922 . In 1969 Bulgaria issued two sets of stamps depicting important scenes of the chronicle , to celebrate it . Manasses also wrote the poetical romance Loves of Aristander and Callithea , also in political verse , is only known from the fragments preserved in the rose - garden of Macanus Chrysocephalus ( 14th century ) . Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects .  - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps.  - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118  24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. His reign saw the last flowering of the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.

Material: cotton outside / inside with synthetic lining with padding Make this lower case","output":"material: cotton outside / inside with synthetic lining with padding The material described above consists of a combination of natural and synthetic components. The outer layer is made from cotton, which is a popular natural fiber known for its softness, breathability, and durability. Cotton is obtained from the cotton plant and has been used in textile production for thousands of years, due to its numerous beneficial properties. Some of these properties include its ability to absorb moisture, its hypoallergenic nature, and its ability to provide insulation in cooler temperatures. On the other hand, the inside of the material features a synthetic lining with padding. Synthetic materials are created using artificial fibers or polymers and have a range of useful characteristics. Often, these materials are more cost-effective and versatile than natural fibers, making them ideal for use in various applications. Synthetic linings offer a range of benefits, such as being lightweight, quick-drying, and resistant to mildew and insects. Moreover, they can be engineered with specific properties to suit specific needs, such as being waterproof or fire-resistant. The padding within the synthetic lining provides added insulation and comfort. This could come in the form of foam, polyester fibers, or other synthetic materials that are designed to trap air and create a barrier between the body and the external environment. This added insulation helps to maintain the wearer's warmth, especially during colder months or in colder climates. One common use for this type of material is in the construction of garments like jackets, blankets, and similar items that require both warmth and moisture control. The combination of cotton on the outside and synthetic lining with padding on the inside creates a balanced and effective insulating and moisture-wicking system that promotes the user's comfort and well-being. In summary, the material described - cotton outside and inside with synthetic lining and padding - is an effective combination of natural and synthetic fibers that provide a range of beneficial properties.

I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul. Question: The author thinks that our shyness is there because  _  . - we are not open enough - we don't feel secure at heart - we try to reach out to others all the time - we lack some social skills Answer:","output":"we don't feel secure at heart"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the context: What does Casey need to do before this? The answer is:","output":"Before Casey can utilize Austin's procedure as an excuse to take two weeks off work, there are several essential steps and actions he may need to undertake. 1. Understand Austin's Procedure: Obviously, before using Austin's procedure as a reason for a leave, Casey must first familiarize himself with what it involves entirely. Is it a medical procedure or a legal process? Is it something complex that requires a long recovery or preparation time? Understanding the procedure will provide him with a plausible explanation to give to his employer. 2. Assess Time Requirement: Casey must assess realistically how much time the procedure would actually require. This would include not only the time taken for the procedure itself but also any preliminary and follow-up phases involved. He must ensure that the two weeks he is planning to take off aligns with the actual time commitments the procedure requires. 3. Communication with Austin: Therefore, it's crucial for Casey to communicate with Austin. This could involve discussing his circumstances, understanding the timing and impact of the procedure, and asking about the possible consequences of taking an extended leave time off work. 4. Medical Consultation: If Austin's procedure is a medical one, a consultation with a healthcare professional is necessary. Casey should discuss with his healthcare provider about the procedure, acquire all necessary medical advice, secure any required appointments, and get a proper medical certificate attesting to his need for leave because of the procedure. 5. Formal Leave Application: Once certain about the time requirements, Casey should then formally apply for his leave of absence from work. This application should include all relevant details such as the reason for the leave (i.e., Austin's procedure), the length of the leave, and any supporting documentation required (like a doctor's certificate, legal paperwork, etc.). 6. Prepare for Procedure: Casey should make all necessary preparations for the procedure. This could be preparing himself physically, mentally, or allocating resources or making necessary arrangements for Austin's procedure and post-procedure recovery period. 7. Inform Key Parties: Before taking off, it is also fundamental that Casey informs anyone who will be directly affected by his absence. These could be colleagues who might need to take on extra work, or clients who may need to adjust their expectations during his leave. Clear communication can prevent possible complications or misunderstandings during his time off. 8. Arrange for Coverage: If Casey's work involves daily tasks that need coverage, it is crucial to make arrangements in advance so his duties are not neglected in his absence. Handing over duties or preparing a detailed work plan for whoever will cover him during these two weeks can help keep his work on track while he is away. 9. Prepare for Return: Lastly, depending on the type of his work, Casey might also need to prepare for his return to work. He should ensure that any tasks due on his return are either completed in advance or properly handed over to others. If Austin's procedure might have an impact on his performance initially, communicating this beforehand will help manage expectations on his return. Following these steps ensures a smooth transition both during the leave and upon his return, minimizing any potential disruption to his work."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identification: Vibhavadi Rangsit was a Thai Princess. It is important to note that this information is specifically relevant to the royal family member, and not the road by the same name, Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, in Thailand. The note ensures clarity for readers who might stumble upon the name without context. 2. Date of Birth and Death: She was born on the 20th of November, 1920, and died on the 16th of February, 1977. 3. Profession: She was renowned for her fiction writing, suggesting that she was a proficient author and a revered literary figure in addition to her royal ties. Although there is no explicit mention of her titles or her most well-known works, it implies a legacy of creative contribution to the Thai literary scene.  4. Social Involvement: Apart from being a writer, the Princess was also engaged in developmental work in rural Thailand. This showcases her commitment to societal growth and development, especially in areas that might lack sufficient resources or exposure. 5. Cause of Death: The write-up also provides significant information regarding the circumstances of her death. The Princess was tragically killed by communist insurgents, a detail which reveals political tensions during her lifetime. The context hints at her active role in society, as she was on a routine visit to assist rural villagers in Surat Thani Province when the incident occurred. Overall, even though the information presented on her seems succinct, her life was multifaceted, moving between artistic pursuits and social development.

Human behaviors and reactions often depend upon a multitude of factors including but not limited to: personality traits, relationship dynamics, contextual factors, and individual's current emotional state.  In the context given, if Casey is being probed with a continuous reel of questions by Lee, it could potentially induce feelings of annoyance, confusion, or anger. Negative emotions may influence Casey to distance herself from the situation or the person causing such feelings, in this case, Lee. This kind of coping strategy is often referred to as an 'avoidance strategy' used when someone tries to remove or evade a stress source. However, the details offered aren't definitive and don't necessarily guarantee Casey's next action. Her response could also depend on her relationship with Lee, her emotional resilience, and her communication skills. If Casey is comfortable with the dynamics of her relationship with Lee, she might also choose to express her discomfort or ask him to limit his questions. Alternatively, she could change the subject, try to answer in short, unencouraging responses, or even attempt to turn the tables by questioning Lee in return.  For instance, if Casey is a patient and polite person who doesn't like confronting people, she might prefer to tolerate the situation instead of walking away. If she values her relationship with Lee, she might not want to offend him by leaving or reacting negatively. Considering this, while \\"walk away from Lee\\" is a possible solution, it's not the only plausible one, as human behavior is complex and greatly shaped by internal and external factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term 'Bantoid' was first used by Krause in 1895 for languages that showed resemblances in vocabulary to Bantu. Greenberg in his 1963 \\"The Languages of Africa\\" defined Bantoid as the group to which (Narrow) Bantu belongs together with its closest relatives; this is the sense in which the term is still used today. The Bantoid languages probably do not actually form a coherent group.  - The NigerCongo languages constitute one of the world's major language families, and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages. They may constitute the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages, although this question is complicated by ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language.  - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.  - Central Africa is a core region of the African continent which includes Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda. Middle Africa (as used by the United Nations when categorising geographic subregions) is an analogous term that includes Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe. All of the states in the UN subregion of Middle Africa, plus those otherwise commonly reckoned in Central Africa (11 states in total), constitute the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Since its independence in 2011, South Sudan has also been commonly included in the region.  - In linguistics, mutual intelligibility is a relationship between languages or dialects in which speakers of different but related varieties can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is generally used as the most important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although sociolinguistic factors are often also used.  - The Mbam languages are a group of erstwhile zone - A Bantu languages which some lexicostatistical studies suggest are not actually Bantu , but related Southern Bantoid languages . Janssens ( 1992 -- 93 ) posits that they are all of Guthrie 's zone A.60 languages , half of his A.40 languages , and perhaps Bube ( A.31 ) . Blench ( 2011 ) includes Jarawan in A.60 , and keeps both in Bantu . Sanaga ( A60 ) : Tuki ( Bacenga ) , Leti West Mbam ( A40 ) : Bati ( A60 ) , Nomaande ( Mandi ) -- Tunen ( Aling'a , Banen ) -- Tuotomb -- Yambeta , Nyokon Yambasa ( A60 ) : Nubaca , Mbule , Nugunu , Elip -- Mmaala -- Yangben Jarawan ( See ) ? Bube ( A31 )  - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).  - Ethnologue: Languages of the World is a web-based publication that contains statistics for 7,457 languages in its 19th edition, which was released in 2016. Of these, 7,097 are listed as living and 360 are listed as extinct. \\"Ethnologue\\" provides information on the number of speakers, location, dialects, linguistic affiliations, availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, and an estimate of language viability using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). The publication is well respected and widely used by linguists.   - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of sanitizing dirty shoes, there are several methods one can consider. Ultimately, the best method depends on a variety of factors such as the type of shoes, material, level of dirtiness, and the desired level of sanitation. Below are four effective methods of sanitizing dirty shoes, along with the pros and cons of each method. 1. Handwashing with soap and water: Pros: - Simple and cost-effective - Can be done at home without any special equipment - Suitable for various types of shoes and materials Cons: - Can be time-consuming, especially for heavily soiled shoes - Not the most effective method for removing all germs - May lead to water damage and discoloration on some shoe materials (e.g., leather, delicate fabrics) 2. Washing in a washing machine: Pros: - Time-efficient, as the machine does most of the work - Can effectively remove dirt and some germs from shoes - Suitable for most casual shoes and sneakers Cons: - Not suitable for shoes made from delicate materials (e.g., leather, suede) or those with glued parts - The machine's agitation can cause physical damage or wear to some shoes - Reduced effectiveness on deep-set stains or significant amounts of mud 3. Using UV light technology: Pros: - Effectively kills bacteria, viruses, and other germs without using water or harmful chemicals - Carefully designed UV shoe sanitizers can be bought online or in retail stores - Suitable for various shoe types and materials, including delicate and non-washable materials Cons: - Generally more expensive compared to other methods - Does not physically remove dirt, dust, or mud from shoes - Requires access to electricity 4. Steam cleaning: Pros: - Can be a highly effective way to sanitize and clean shoes using just water - Effective on various types of shoes, works on most materials - Penetrates deep into the fabric, potentially removing deep-set dirt and stains Cons: - Requires a steam cleaner, which can be an expensive investment - Not suitable for shoes made from materials that can be damaged by high heat or moisture (e.g., leather, some delicate fabrics) - May not be as efficient in removing large amounts of mud or debris In summary, the most appropriate sanitation method for dirty shoes depends on a variety of factors. For shoes made from sturdy materials and without delicate parts, washing in a washing machine is a quick and effective option. Handwashing with soap and water can be an alternative for those who prefer a more gentle approach. UV light technology provides an ideal solution for sanitizing shoes without damage or water, while steam cleaning can deep clean and sanitize shoes using hot steam.

Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio.  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland.

The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw.  - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.

Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations  B. because President Moon wants him to  C. because he said he would  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there as well as in Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy.[Q] The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity? Answer:","output":"The Blue team's racers did not have their muscles prepared for the activity. As mentioned in the given paragraph, the White team warmed up properly before the race, which indicates that they effectively prepared their muscles for the upcoming physical activity. It is essential for athletes to warm up before engaging in any sport or rigorous activity, as it helps reduce the risk of injuries, improves flexibility, and increases the blood circulation to muscles, preparing them for the upcoming demand. In contrast, the Blue team arrived late due to transportation issues with the bus and did not have enough time to warm up before the start of the 5 km race. As a result, their racers did not have the opportunity to properly condition and prepare their muscles for the race, making them more prone to potential injuries, muscle strain, or overall less optimal performance during the competition. Warm-up exercises – including light aerobic activities, dynamic stretching, or sports-specific exercises – are crucial for athletes to prepare their bodies and ensure their muscles are ready to handle the stress, impact, and endurance of a race or other high-intensity activities.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons.  He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar.  When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested.  Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever.  After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.   Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town.

Answer:","output":"Leukemia The question asks for a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated. In this case, the best answer among the given choices is leukemia. Cancer is a broad term for various diseases characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells, which can invade and damage healthy tissue. In particular, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Leukemia occurs when the DNA of immature blood cells, specifically the white blood cells, becomes damaged, and they grow and divide uncontrollably. Since the cell cycle is no longer regulated, these abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood-forming cells. This leads to a deficiency of normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, which can cause various complications such as infections, anemia, and increased bleeding tendency. There are different types of leukemia, classified based on the types of blood cells affected and the rate of progression. Some of the common types include: 1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in children. 2. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) - Fast-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; can occur in both children and adults. 3. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting lymphoid cells; most common in adults over the age of 55. 4. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) - Slow-growing leukemia affecting myeloid cells; usually diagnosed in adults.

Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net. Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for 14.88.      The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common.

The project, at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, invites visitors to say the words “He will not divide us” into a camera for a 24-hour livestream, which will be broadcast on the web for the entirety of the Trump presidency.      The problem was that not everyone wanted to say “He will not divide us.” To be more specific, a Nazi showed up who wanted to say “1488,” instead. (Calling modern-day white supremacists Nazis may be imprecise in many cases, but this guy was literally wearing a SS M43 field cap, though he at least was ashamed of himself enough to remove the Totenkopf.) “1488,” of course, is a white supremacist code number that combines white supremacy’s 14-word creed with a reference to “Heil Hitler,” H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. It was created by white supremacist murderer David Lane, the same charmer who invented the “white genocide” myth. (Saying “Heil Hitler,” even in code, is another cutoff point where it probably ought to be ok to call someone a Nazi.)

He followed the guy around until he returned to the microphone (to tell the world, “We must secure the existence of the white race”) then simply out-yelled him while edging him out of frame. Watching the Nazi try to work his way back to the camera (and fail) is another bittersweet pleasure of the Trump era.

You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? === The answer to the above question is   (1). Because he wanted to win, with no other reason  (2). Because Democrats were insulting Trump  (3). not enough information  (4). Because opinion polls said they had an edge The answer is:","output":"(4). Because opinion polls said they had an edge"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Sahih al-Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, \\"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell\\" and Aisha reported, \\"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\\" Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \\"one mighty in power\\", the one who \\"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia.

As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, influenced in particular by Nasserism, the thought of Egyptian revolutionary and president Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom Gaddafi adopted as his hero. During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as Third International Theory, which has been described as a combination of \\"utopian socialism, Arab nationalism, and the Third World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time\\". He laid out the principles of this Theory in the three volumes of The Green Book, in which he sought to \\"explain the structure of the ideal society.\\" His Arab nationalist views led him to believe that there needed to be unity across the Arab world, combining the Arab nation under a single nation-state.

Place the plant in the new pot, making sure the top of the root ball is approximately one inch below the pot's rim. Fill in around the roots with your prepared soil mix, and gently press down the soil to remove any air pockets. 3. Water and light requirements: Water your anthurium plant thoroughly after planting. The plant prefers consistently moist soil, but it is crucial to avoid overwatering. Check the top inch of soil regularly and water when it feels slightly dry. Anthuriums thrive in bright, indirect light with temperatures ranging from 65°F to 85°F. Place the pot near a window where it will receive filtered sunlight or growing under fluorescent lights. 4. Humidity and air circulation: Anthurium plants flourish in a humid environment. To increase humidity around your plant, place it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier. Ensure there is proper air circulation to discourage pests and diseases, but avoid placing the plant near drafts, air conditioners, or heating vents. 5. Fertilization: Feed your anthurium every six to eight weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer, diluted to half-strength. Regularly providing nutrients will encourage the growth of vibrant foliage and blooms. 6. Pruning and maintenance: Prune your anthurium by removing dead or damaged leaves and spent flower spikes with a clean, sharp pair of scissors. This will promote new growth and maintain the plant's healthy appearance. Additionally, clean the leaves gently with a damp cloth to remove dust and support photosynthesis. 7. Watch for pests and diseases: Monitor your anthurium plant for common pests, such as aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. Safely manage these issues by using insecticidal soap or neem oil. Keep an eye out for signs of diseases, like root rot or bacterial and fungal infections, and treat promptly to prevent them from spreading. 8. Repotting: As anthurium plants grow, they may become root-bound, which can limit their overall health and growth. Monitor your plant and repot it in a slightly larger container every two to three years, during the spring or summer months, using fresh soil mix. By following these comprehensive guidelines and giving proper attention and care, you'll be well on your way to nurturing a thriving, eye-catching anthurium plant with lush foliage and stunning blooms to enjoy for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Primal Fear Context: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand), the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an...

Answer the question...when did parker brothers make the ouija board??","output":"Parker Brothers, an American toy and game manufacturer, first began producing the Ouija board in 1966. However, the history of the Ouija board dates back to much earlier than that. The Ouija board, also known as a \\"spirit\\" or \\"talking\\" board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\", and \\"goodbye\\", and sometimes other symbols or graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is believed to move across the board to spell out words or answer questions posed by the users. The mysterious movement of the planchette has often been attributed to supernatural forces or spirit communications. The concept of the Ouija board can be traced back to mid-19th century spiritualism, particularly in the United States. In the era of the Civil War, the spiritualist movement gained popularity as people sought to communicate with deceased loved ones. The precursors to the Ouija board included various devices used for automatic writing, such as planchettes with pencils attached to the tips and the dial plate, which used a spinning dial instead of a planchette. In 1890, a patent was granted to Elijah Bond, Charles Kennard, and William H. A. Maupin for a talking board on which the Ouija name was first introduced. The name \\"Ouija\\" has been claimed to be a combination of the French word \\"oui\\" and the German word \\"ja\\", both meaning \\"yes\\". However, it has also been suggested that the name came through the board itself during a session that involved the sister-in-law of Elijah Bond, who identified the board as Ouija and declared that it meant \\"good luck\\" in ancient Egyptian. The board was initially produced and marketed by the Kennard Novelty Company, and, following the company's dissolution in 1898, production and distribution of the Ouija board was taken over by William Fuld. He marketed the board under the brand name Ouija and continued to produce and sell the Ouija board until his death in 1927. After Fuld's death, his heirs continued to manufacture and market Ouija boards under the name William Fuld Talking Board Set. Finally, in 1966, the Fuld family sold the manufacturing and marketing rights for Ouija boards to Parker Brothers, the company that popularized the board game Monopoly. Parker Brothers produced and marketed Ouija boards as a family game and maintained ownership until 1991, when they were acquired by Hasbro Inc., which currently owns the rights to the Ouija board/trademark and continues to manufacture it under the same specifications and designs introduced by Parker Brothers. In summary, while the Ouija board's origins can be traced back to the mid-19th century spiritualist movement, it wasn't until 1966 that Parker Brothers began producing the well-known and widely-used version of the board that we are familiar with today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure. The tenant can ask the court to issue a restraining order, file a criminal complaint against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees. Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Answer: The answer is:","output":"Goals should be set because they provide several important functions in achieving desired outcomes and personal growth. Here is a detailed explanation of the various reasons why setting goals is essential: 1. Direction and Focus: Goals help to provide direction and purpose in our lives. When we set goals, we are creating an action plan that guides us towards a specific objective. This direction gives our actions a clear purpose and allows us to maintain focus, ensuring that our efforts are aligned with our overall vision. 2. Motivation: Setting goals acts as a powerful motivator, as it helps us identify what is truly important to us and provides a sense of accomplishment once we achieve them. This motivation fuels our efforts and increases our perseverance, driving us to overcome obstacles and challenges that may arise along the way. 3. Measurable Progress: One of the significant advantages of setting goals is the ability to measure progress. By breaking the ultimate goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, we can track our achievements over specific periods (daily, weekly, monthly), allowing us to evaluate our progress, celebrate milestones, and adjust our approach if necessary. 4. Time Management and Efficiency: Goal setting helps to enhance time management and improve efficiency in our daily lives. When we have clear objectives, we can prioritize tasks effectively, allocate time and resources wisely, and set realistic deadlines for ourselves. This enables us to make the most of our time, maintain focus on the task at hand and avoid distractions. 5. Personal Growth and Development: Goals play a crucial role in promoting personal growth and development. When we set and pursue goals, we step out of our comfort zones, develop new skills, become more resilient, and discover our inner strengths. This process of self-improvement and self-discovery fosters self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-esteem. 6. Satisfaction and Sense of Achievement: Achieving goals provides a deep sense of satisfaction, accomplishment, and fulfillment. This feeling of success can improve our overall sense of well-being, happiness, and quality of life, further motivating us to continue setting and achieving new goals. In summary, setting goals is essential because it provides us with direction, focus, motivation, a tool for evaluating progress, improved time management and efficiency, personal growth and development, and a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Goals enable us to make constructive choices, remain persistent in challenging situations, and stay focused on our ultimate targets, ensuring long-term success in our personal and professional lives."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A famished Wile E. Coyote, (Eatibus Anythingus), trudges across the floor of the desert, catching anything that he can find, from a fly to an empty tin can, with the intention of eating it. Suddenly, he is flattened by the Road Runner, (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile recovers, blinks his eyes, and has a vision of a wonderful Road Runner feast. He then ditches the tin can and chases after the Road Runner, adopting a low stance to reduce his drag which allows him to close in on the Road Runner, but the bird finds another gear and rockets away, leaving the coyote's eyes to pop out of his sockets. Dejected, he plans his next scheme.Wile sets up a pulley, rope and rock trap to try smashing the passing Road Runner, hoping its extra complexity will stop Wile from being squashed, but the rock finds a way to squash the coyote as the Road Runner stops to mock him.A furious Wile arms himself with a lasso as he waits for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso before the bird can get there, and drags Wile across the hard ground. As the coyote paces off the road, we see that the friction has left Wile with a bare rear end.Wile then uses a How-To book to build a Burmese tiger trap. He digs a square pit in the road and fills it with a sheet camouflaged as a road. As he hides behind a nearby rock, he hears the Road Runner go \\"beep beep\\", followed by the sound of the trap being activated. He dives into the pit to capture his prey, but instantly re-emerges and flees in terror when an animal stealthily climbs out of the trap. The animal is subsequently identified as a Burmese Tiger (Surprisibus! Surprisibus!) before it stalks off.Next, Wile sets up a pop-up grate in the middle of the road with the intention of using it to block the Road Runner.

Information:  - Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia. The name \\"Melbourne\\" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians.  - The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \\"bracelets\\". During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia.  - A poker tournament is a tournament where players compete by playing poker. It can feature as few as two players playing on a single table (called a \\"heads-up\\" tournament), and as many as tens of thousands of players playing on thousands of tables. The winner of the tournament is usually the person who wins every poker chip in the game and the others are awarded places based on the time of their elimination. To facilitate this, in most tournaments, blinds rise over the duration of the tournament. Unlike in a ring game (or cash game), a player's chips in a tournament cannot be cashed out for money and serve only to determine the player's placing.  - The World Poker Tour (WPT) is a series of international poker tournaments and associated television series broadcasting the final table of each tournament. It was started in 2002 in the United States by attorney/television producer Steven Lipscomb, who served as CEO of WPT Enterprises (WPTE), the firm that controlled the World Poker Tour up to November 2009. In 2008, the WPT started offering bracelets to its event champions. Players who won a title prior to the release of the WPT Bracelet were given one retroactively.  - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures.  - The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside of Las Vegas. From its inception to the 2013 tournament, players from 19 countries  USA (10), France (4), UK (3), Denmark (3), Canada (2), Norway (2), Portugal (2), Italy (2), Afghanistan, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Tunisia, Switzerland, Australia, Italy and Finland  have won bracelets.  - Jason Warner ( born c. 1985 ) is a Canadian hardware store worker who won a World Series of Poker bracelet in the 2007  1,500 No - Limit Hold'em short handed . Warner does not like playing poker online , preferring to play at the River Rock Casino near Vancouver . Prior to winning his bracelet he participated in one other WSOP event and a Canadian Poker Tour event where he won  22,000 .

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? A cypriot is someone from Cyprus.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" does indeed follow the initial statement, as it provides a definition that helps clarify the nationality of the people mentioned, Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, as well as the citizens affected by their decisions. The initial statement sets the context by explaining a significant event occurring in Cyprus and includes figures of high relevance for their nation. Specifically, it references Glavkos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, who lead different political factions in Cyprus. Their plan to meet after four years of having no such dialogues might have a significant impact on the Cypriot political landscape and comes as a shock to their citizens, referred to here as \\"Cypriots.\\" The following sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" is a general statement that denotes who Cypriots are. This concise definition can be especially helpful for those not familiar with the term, offering valuable context and understanding to the audience. It helps to establish the nationality of not just Clerides and Denktash but also of the people likely to be most directly affected by their planned meeting and subsequent decisions. Although the second sentence is not directly linked to the narrative of the first, it aids reader understanding by defining what it means to be a Cypriot, which is implied to be of notable relevance, given the circumstances discussed in the initial text. The juxtaposition of a significant political event that impacts Cypriots with the simple definition of \\"Cypriot\\" underscores the nationwide implications this meeting could potentially have for people from Cyprus.  So, in summary, while the second sentence does not advance the narrative of the first, it does serve to clarify terminology that is vital to understanding the gravity of the initially referenced event. Therefore, the sentence \\"A Cypriot is someone from Cyprus\\" indeed follows the preceding text and enhances the reader's comprehension.

The people don't want to treat the infection rather than the sickness, because the","output":"infection is only a symptom of the underlying issue and it is more crucial to address the root cause, which is the sickness itself. Treating the infection alone may provide temporary relief, but it would not be a long-term solution or contribute to their overall well-being. Ignoring the root cause and only treating the infection might lead to a vicious cycle, as the infection could come back again and again. This may deteriorate the individual's overall health and wellbeing, ultimately causing more harm than good. To break free from this cycle, it is important to focus on treating the sickness. The people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness may stem from the following reasons: 1. Comprehensive approach to healthcare: People have become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing health issues holistically. They realize that understanding and tackling the underlying cause is vital to prevent recurrent infections and promote overall health. 2. Prevention is better than cure: In the long run, treating the sickness before it leads to infections saves both time and resources. By addressing the root cause, people can avoid the potential complications and additional treatments that may arise from recurrent infections. 3. The desire for long-lasting results: Short-term fixes, such as treating the infection without addressing the sickness, are less preferable because they do not guarantee long-lasting results. People may be more inclined to invest their time and effort into understanding and treating the sickness, knowing that this approach will provide more sustainable solutions. 4. Increased knowledge and awareness: The rise of the internet and advancements in medical research have provided people with a wealth of information on various health issues. As a result, they are better informed about the importance of understanding and treating the underlying causes of their health problems, rather than just addressing the symptoms. 5. Widespread advocacy for improved healthcare: Many healthcare professionals, including doctors and public health experts, emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of health problems, rather than just treating the symptoms. This advocacy has significantly influenced public opinion and led to a shift in the approach to healthcare. In conclusion, the people's reluctance to treat the infection rather than the sickness stems from their understanding of the importance of addressing the underlying causes of health issues. This shift in perspective echoes the desire for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare, emphasizing the need to not only treat the symptoms but also address the root causes for long-lasting results. As society continues to prioritize prevention and holistic health, treating the sickness over the infection will remain the preferred approach for many."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.  answer the following question:  What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria?

In particular, she blackmails Rosalie Wells, whom she caught stealing a bracelet.One day, Mary lies to Lily about skipping part of her elocution class. Karen tries to comfort Mary, saying, \\"If you need to let off steam, just tell us the truth and we'll try to understand,\\" but Mary sociopathically sticks to her lie. Karen punishes her by refusing to let her attend the weekend's boat races. A furious Mary exacts her revenge by inventing a story about Martha and Karen being involved in a love affair. Her tale is based on fragments of a quarrel that Mary's roommates accidentally overheard. Mary tells her grandmother that she observed the two women kissing each other. Mrs. Tilford believes her granddaughter, and immediately informs the other parents. As a result, all girls are withdrawn from the school, without giving Karen or Martha any explanations. Finally, one father offers a straight answer. Karen learns the real reason behind the sudden action. She angrily confronts Mrs. Tilford together with Joe and Martha. Mary again tells her tale, and forces Rosalie to confirm her statements. The two framed women sue Mrs. Tilford for libel and slander, but fail in court.The story is circulated in the local media, utterly destroying the reputation of the two teachers. Only Joe still keeps contact to the two women, offering to take them away and start a new life. However, even his trust in Karen is shaken, and he thus...

This statement provides specific information about the individual - their gender, the presence of a big backpack, and their path of movement.  However, we cannot infer from this information that a man with a big backpack is walking through a grass trail up a hill unless further context or evidence is provided. The two statements refer to different individuals, as one is about a man and the other is about a woman. Consequently, the two scenarios are independent of each other and the first statement does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the second statement.

Question: What does she call the money that she slips under the door to Joe Gargery Movie title: Great Expectations Movie plot: 10-year-old Finnegan \\"Finn\\" Bell is playing on a beach in the Gulf Coast when an escaped convict suddenly pops out of the water and overpowers him, making Finn promise to bring back food, medicine and bolt cutters to get the iron shackles off his leg. Finn complies, and the convict unexpectedly tries to make Finn take him by boat to Mexico. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy, and Finn's boat is towed back to shore. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict, mobster Arthur Lustig, had escaped from death row, but was recaptured and would face execution soon. Finn's uncle Joe Gargery is called to Paradiso Perduto (\\"lost paradise\\"), home of the richest woman in Florida, Mrs. Nora Dinsmoor. She is a local mystery, having shunned virtually all human contact since she was left at the altar several years before. She ostensibly asks him there to do a gardening job, but instead she slips him a large sum of money under the door, calling it \\"gas money\\". Meanwhile, Finn, who he brought along, meets Mrs. Dinsmoor's young niece Estella in the overgrown garden. Mrs. Dinsmoor sees them interacting and calls Maggie (Kim Dickens), Finn's sister, to ask her to let Finn be a playmate for Estella, even though Estella apparently dislikes him. On Finn's first visit, she is disappointed when the boy cannot dance for her, but is intrigued when he says he can draw. She forces Estella to sit for a portrait, which Finn draws with make up on an old piece of wallpaper. While he draws, Mrs. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken. After the portrait session, Mrs. Dinsmoor calls it a day and asks Estella to help Finn find the door. On the way out, she pauses to take a drink from a water fountain and politely offers him a drink from it as well. While Finn is drinking, Estella kisses him. Several years pass.

Once mixed well, add 7-10 drops of peppermint essential oil and 7-10 drops of lavender oil with a dropper. Mix everything together with a spoon, and store in an air-tight jar. To use, pour into a hot bath and relax. Here are the reasons why option B is the better choice: 1. Ingredient choice: In option A, orange soda is used as one of the main ingredients. It contains artificial flavors, sugar, and carbonation, which makes it an inappropriate ingredient for a foot soak. These additives can leave a sticky residue on the skin and be counterproductive to the aim of a soothing foot soak. On the other hand, option B uses bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), which is a natural ingredient, known for its alkalizing and detoxifying properties. It helps in effectively softening and exfoliating the skin, making it more suitable for a foot soak. 2. Purpose of the soak: Option B uses ingredients that contribute to the overall soothing effect of the foot soak. Epsom salts and bicarbonate of soda help in soothing tired muscles, reducing inflammation, and softening the skin. Peppermint and lavender essential oils offer relaxing scents and additional therapeutic benefits. Option A's use of orange soda negates some of these benefits due to the harmful effects of its additives. 3. Ease of use and storage: Both options suggest storing the mixture in an air-tight jar. However, option B's mixture of dry ingredients makes it more suitable for long-term storage, as it won't release carbon dioxide like option A's orange soda would when mixed with the other ingredients. This makes option B a more practical choice as well. In conclusion, option B is the more sensible choice for making a soothing foot soak, due to a better selection of ingredients, alignment with the purpose of the foot soak, and practicality when it comes to storage and use."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Because liquid water is essential to life,the findings could have major implications for the possibility of Martian life.The researchers said further exploration is needed to determine whether microscopic life exists on the planet. The presence of liquid water could also make life easier for astronauts visiting or living on Mars.Water could be used for drinking and for creating oxygen and rocket fuel.NASA's goal is to send humans there in the 2030s. The evidence of flowing water consists largely of dark,narrow streaks  on the surface that tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months and fade the rest of the year. Mars is extremely cold even in summer,and the streaks are in places where the temperature is as low as minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit.But salt can lower the freezing point of water and melt ice. The source of the water is a mystery.Scientists noted it could be melting ice.It could be an underground aquifer,which is rock or sand that can hold water.It is possibly water vapor from the thin Martian atmosphere,Or it may be a combination Michael Meyer,lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program,said the only definitive way for now to determine whether there's life on Mars is to collect rocks and soil for analysis on Earth - something a U.S.lander  set for lift-off in 2020 will do.

Information:  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - Etymology. Rishiri derives its name from the Ainu language, and means \\"high island\\", or \\"island with a high peak\\", a reference to the altitude of Mount Rishiri above sea level.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - History. Hokkaido () was settled by the Ainu, Nivkh, and Orok before recorded history. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and Emishi. One of the places Hirafu went to was called , which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaido. However, many theories exist in relation to the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people.  - The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean, lying between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaido to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (the Shantar Sea) along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East.  - The Ainu or the Aynu (Ainu  \\"Aynu\\"; Japanese: \\"Ainu\\"; Russian: \\"Ajny\\"), in the historical Japanese texts Ezo/Emishi/Ebisu or Ainu, are an indigenous people of Japan (Hokkaido, and formerly northeastern Honshu) and Russia (Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and formerly the Kamchatka Peninsula).  - Rebun Island (, \\"Rebun-t\\") is an island in the Sea of Japan off the northwestern tip of Hokkaid, Japan.

Rebun Island is located northwest of Rishiri Island, and the two islands are separated by the Rebun Channel.  - The , also read as Ashihase and Shukushin, were a people of ancient Japan, believed to have lived along the northern portion of the coast of the Sea of Japan. The term Sushen, rendered , is found in Chinese records, but is annotated as Mishihase or Ashihase in Japanese language documents, which should have developed into *\\"Mishiwase\\" or *\\"Ashiwase\\" in Modern Japanese if the word had survived in colloquial speech.  - The Sea of Japan (see below for other names) is a marginal sea between the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin, and the Asian mainland. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by Japan, North Korea, Russia and South Korea. Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean. This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - The , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan, is the second oldest book of classical Japanese history. The book is also called the . It is more elaborate and detailed than the \\"Kojiki\\", the oldest, and has proven to be an important tool for historians and archaeologists as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\" was finished in 720 under the editorial supervision of Prince Toneri and with the assistance of  no Yasumaro dedicated to Empress Gensh.  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - Abe no Hirafu might be the ancestor of one or more of the Abe clans, as well as the Ando and Akita clans.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

Review: because I didn't like this at all and it DEFINITELY isn't worth the price!! It's too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places, at least for me. It did work well for trimming prior to shaving, but if you don't let it get to that point, it's unnecessary anyway. I'm not sure who's going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn't trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!! Plus, for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry. Save your money. The trimmer attachment on my husbands electric razor works 10 times better. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is clearly negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the product in several ways throughout the review.  Firstly, the title \\"Guess I'm the minority...\\" implies that the reviewer disagrees with the majority of people who may have praised the product. The reviewer further emphasizes their displeasure by stating \\"because I didn't like this at all and it DEFINITELY isn't worth the price!!\\" which highlights their dissatisfaction with both the product's functionality and its cost. One of the major complaints in the review is about the product being \\"too thick and awkward to get into all those hard to reach places,\\" which suggests that the reviewer found the product challenging to use. The reviewer also mentions that the product worked well for one specific purpose (trimming prior to shaving), but they ultimately deem it unnecessary. Another significant criticism in this review can be seen in the statement, \\"I'm not sure who's going out in a bikini after using this, but it doesn't trim the hairs short enough that I want to see you in a bikini after using it!!\\" This remark highlights that the reviewer does not believe the product delivers on its promise of providing an adequate trim for bikini usage. The reviewer also criticizes the lack of features for the price they paid, as they mention \\"for this price, it should be rechargeable and wet/dry.\\" This indicates that they find the product to be overpriced for its capabilities and features. Lastly, the reviewer ends the review by suggesting an alternative product, as they mention that \\"the trimmer attachment on my husband's electric razor works 10 times better.\\" This recommendation shows that the reviewer has tried better alternatives and emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the reviewed product. Overall, the tone of this product review is undoubtedly negative, as the reviewer lists multiple complaints, finds the product to be overpriced, and suggests using alternative products instead."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Figure 15, amend the figure and insert a table to read: Translate to French.","output":"Dans la Figure 15, modifier la figure et insérer un tableau pour lire: Translation: Dans la Figure 15, apportez des modifications à la figure et insérez un tableau qui doit être lu comme suit : It seems like you want me to provide a translation into French for the given task. However, the task itself is missing certain key elements such as context or a specific figure and table. In order to provide the most relevant and accurate translation, I would need more information on the content of the figure, what changes need to be made, and the table that should be inserted. Nonetheless, I can give you some general advice on how to amend a figure and insert a table in French. 1. First, identify the specific elements of the figure that need to be modified. Be sure to provide clear instructions on which parts should be changed and how they should be altered. In French, this can be communicated using phrases like \\"modifier l'élément X\\" (modify element X) or \\"remplacer Y par Z\\" (replace Y with Z). 2. Once the changes to the figure have been clearly stated, the next step is to insert a table. In French, the word \\"tableau\\" is used to describe a table, and \\"insérer\\" means to insert. To instruct someone to insert a table, you can use the phrase \\"insérez un tableau\\". 3. It's essential to provide details about the table's content, structure, and formatting. This can include information on the number of rows and columns, as well as any headings, labels, or specific data that should be included. To describe these aspects in French, you can use terms like \\"colonnes\\" (columns), \\"lignes\\" (rows), \\"en-tête\\" (header or heading), and \\"étiquettes\\" (labels). 4. Lastly, ensure the table is formatted and styled consistently with the rest of the document. This might involve specifying font types and sizes, colors, and alignment settings. Some useful French terms for discussing formatting include \\"police\\" (font), \\"taille\\" (size), \\"couleurs\\" (colors), and \\"alignement\\" (alignment). Here's an example of a more detailed task in French, assuming that we want to modify Figure 15 by changing the color of a specific element and inserting a table with four columns and three rows: \\"Dans la Figure 15, modifiez la couleur de l'élément A en bleu. Ensuite, insérez un tableau avec quatre colonnes et trois lignes. Les en-têtes des colonnes doivent être 'Colonne 1', 'Colonne 2', 'Colonne 3', et 'Colonne 4'. Les étiquettes des lignes doivent être 'Ligne 1', 'Ligne 2', et 'Ligne 3'. Utilisez la police Arial en taille 12 et alignez le texte à gauche.\\" By providing more context and information, we can offer a more detailed and accurate translation, and thus assist better in the given task."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed him to a five-year contract.  On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting the \\"Reg-GIE!\\" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting \\"Steinbrenner sucks!\\" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made as Yankee owner.  That season, the Angels won the American League West, and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off Bud Black of the Royals.  In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at-bat, at Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5-2. Jackson was the last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics.

LUCREZIA'S THIRD MARRIAGE  At about the same time that Burchard was making in his Diarium those entries which reflect so grossly upon the Pope and Lucrezia, Gianluca Pozzi, the ambassador of Ferrara at the Vatican, was writing the following letter to his master, Duke Ercole, Lucrezia's father-in-law elect:  \\"This evening, after supper, I accompanied Messer Gerardo Saraceni to visit the Most Illustrious Madonna Lucrezia in your Excellency's name and that of the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso. We entered into a long discussion touching various matters. In truth she showed herself a prudent, discreet, and good-natured lady.\\"(1)  1 See Gregorovius's Lucrezia Borgia.  The handsome, athletic Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, with his brothers Sigismondo and Fernando, had arrived in Rome on December 23 with the imposing escort that was to accompany their brother Alfonso's bride back to Ferrara.  Cesare was prominent in the welcome given them. Never, perhaps, had he made greater display than on the occasion of his riding out to meet the Ferrarese, accompanied by no fewer than 4,000 men-at-arms, and mounted on a great war-horse whose trappings of cloth of gold and jewels were estimated at 10,000 ducats.  The days and nights that followed, until Lucrezia's departure a fortnight later, were days and nights of gaiety and merry-making at the Vatican; in banquets, dancing, the performance of comedies, masques, etc., was the time made to pass as agreeably as might be for the guests from Ferrara, and in all Cesare was conspicuous, either for the grace and zest with which he nightly danced, or for the skill and daring which he displayed in the daily joustings and entertainments, and more particularly in the bull-fight that was included in them.  1.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Wigtown Burghs , also known as Wigton Burghs , . was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1885 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament ( MP ) . The first election in Wigtown Burghs was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details .  - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries).  - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value.  - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross.  - Newton Stewart (Gd: \\"Baile Ùr nan Stiùbhartach\\") is a former burgh town in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. The town is on the River Cree with most of the town to the west of the river, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway to the Galloway Hills\\". Newton Stewart has also recently been twinned with the French town of Marcoussis.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament.  - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801.  - Stranraer is a town in Inch, Wigtownshire, in the west of Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. It lies on the shores of Loch Ryan, on the northern side of the isthmus joining the Rhins of Galloway to the mainland. Stranraer is Dumfries and Galloway's second-largest town, with a population including the surrounding area of nearly 13,000.  - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London.  - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries was a civil parish and became the county town of the former county of Dumfriesshire. Dumfries is nicknamed \\"Queen of the South\\". People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\".  - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.  - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the  representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title.  - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries.  - Wigtown is a town and former royal burgh in Wigtownshire, of which it is the county town, within the Dumfries and Galloway region in Scotland. It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000.  - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland.  - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. Although abolished in law in 1975, the term is still used by many former royal burghs.  - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.  - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament  taxation, legislation and policy-making  but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.    What is the relationship between 'wigtown burghs ' and 'dumfries and galloway'? Answer:","output":"Wigtown Burghs was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain (from 1708 to 1800) and the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (from 1801 to 1885). It was made up of a group of burghs in the historic county of Wigtownshire and represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). Wigtownshire, which is now known as the County of Wigtown, is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland.  Dumfries and Galloway is a unitary council area of Scotland, which includes the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and Wigtownshire. Wigtownshire, where Wigtown Burghs was located, is part of the Dumfries and Galloway region. In summary, the relationship between Wigtown Burghs and Dumfries and Galloway is that Wigtown Burghs was a historical parliamentary constituency in Wigtownshire, which is now a part of the larger Dumfries and Galloway council area in Scotland."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although each woman's experience and anatomy may slightly differ, there are general steps you can follow to find the G-spot: 1. Make sure both you and your partner are comfortable and relaxed. Good communication is key for any sexual activity. 2. Make sure your partner is aroused. The G-spot becomes more prominent and easier to locate during sexual arousal. 3. Use proper lubrication. This will make the exploration more comfortable and pleasurable for your partner. 4. Insert your finger(s) 1.5-2 inches into the vagina with your palm facing up. The G-spot is located on the anterior (front) wall of the vagina, underneath the pubic bone. 5. Use a come-hither motion with your finger(s). You should feel a spongy, textured area that may respond positively to stimulation; this is the G-spot. 6. Observe your partner's reactions and pleasure cues. This will indicate whether you have found the right spot and if the stimulation is enjoyable for them. Regarding looking older, there are various strategies you can try to appear older than your current age: 1. Dress maturely: Choose clothing that is sophisticated and age-appropriate. Avoid overly youthful or trendy fashions, and instead select classic, tailored pieces like blazers, trousers, or dresses. 2. Refine your makeup: Opt for a subtle, natural makeup look rather than bold or experimental styles. Consider using more earth-tone color palettes and highlight your features rather than creating intensity. 3. Hairstyle: A polished, age-appropriate hairstyle can make a difference. Consult with a hairstylist to find a suitable haircut that complements your facial features and gives you a more mature appearance. 4. Posture and body language: Display confidence and maturity through maintaining good posture and exhibiting composed body language. 5. Speech and communication: Refine your speech and communication skills to engage in articulate, mature conversations. This can help you be perceived as wiser and more sophisticated.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to make cookie dough.","output":"Making cookie dough is an enjoyable and delicious process. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make cookie dough: Ingredients: - 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour - 1/2 teaspoon (2g) baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt - 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened - 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar - 1 large egg - 1 1/2 teaspoons (7 ml) vanilla extract - Optional: 1 to 2 cups (170 to 340g) chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins Instructions: 1. Gather all the ingredients and equipment: Before starting, make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment needed, such as a mixing bowl, an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, a whisk, measuring cups and spoons, and a rubber spatula. 2. Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. This will ensure even distribution of the baking powder and salt in the dough later. Set this bowl aside. 3. Cream butter and sugar: In a large mixing bowl, add the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar. Using an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This process typically takes about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed or 5-7 minutes when doing it by hand. Creaming the butter and sugar together is an essential step because it helps in incorporating air into the dough, resulting in a tender and light texture when baked. 4. Add the egg and vanilla extract: Once the butter and sugar mixture is creamy and fluffy, add the large egg and vanilla extract. Beat or mix the ingredients together until they are well combined. The egg provides structure and moisture, while the vanilla extract adds flavor to the dough. 5. Incorporate the dry ingredients: Gradually add the whisked dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) to the wet ingredients (butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract). Mix until just combined, ensuring that there are no pockets of dry flour remaining. Be careful not to overmix as this can cause the dough to become tough. 6. Add mix-ins (optional): If you wish to include chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins, now is the time to add them to the dough. Fold them in gently using a rubber spatula to distribute them evenly throughout the dough. 7. Chill the dough: Although this step is optional, it is recommended to chill the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. This step allows the dough to firm up, making it more manageable when handling, and helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. To chill, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the dough to an airtight container. 8. Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: When you're ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking. 9. Scoop and shape the dough: Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop out the desired amount of dough and shape it into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, ensuring they are spaced about 2 inches (5 cm) apart to allow room for spreading while baking. 10. Bake the cookies: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The baking time may vary depending on the size of your cookies. 11. Let the cookies cool: When the cookies are baked, remove the baking sheets from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. That's it! You've successfully made cookie dough and transformed it into cookies. You can now enjoy them with your friends and family or store them in an airtight container for up to a week."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years. These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in hazardous conditions. What did the international acts do? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The international acts played a vital role in shaping and influencing the legal actions taken in India to protect children's rights and ensure their well-being. The Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act, passed in 1924, and The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, enacted in 1948, outlined the fundamental human rights and needs of children. These declarations emphasized the importance of proper progression and growth during a child's formative years. By incorporating the principles set forth in these international acts, India was encouraged to reevaluate its policies and labor laws, especially those affecting children. As a result, major changes occurred within the Indian workforce. In 1986, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was established, which prohibited the hiring of children younger than 14 and banned their employment in hazardous conditions. In summary, the international acts contributed to raising awareness and setting standards regarding children's rights and their proper treatment in the global community. These acts served as a catalyst for India to implement legal measures that better protected its young citizens from exploitation and provided them with opportunities for a healthy and safe upbringing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Patrick, a 430lb Western lowland gorilla, will be moved from Dallas Zoo to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, where he will live the bachelor life in his own digs. His new home is known for working with gorillas with behaviour problems. Not a ladies' man: Patrick, a 430-pound Western lowland gorilla, will be moved to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, after he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. Dallas Zoo officials said Patrick gets along fine with humans but not with other gorillas. They said they have tried repeatedly to socialise him with the other gorillas, particularly the females, in the hopes that he might get along and even breed. Instead, he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. 'It's not like we haven't tried, he's been here for 18 years' said Laurie Holloway, a spokesman for the zoo. Patrick was more tolerant of other male gorillas but seemed only to engage with Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after he escaped in 2004 and injured three people. Only friend: Patrick (background) with his friend Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after escaping and injuring three people in 2004. Because of his cranky behaviour, Patrick has been kept in his own habitat separate from the other gorillas. But Dallas Zoo needs to reclaim Patrick's space because it recently acquired two new males from the Calgary Zoo, including Zola, a break-dancing gorilla who stars in a video that has gone viral on the Internet. John Davis, curator of mammals at the Riverbanks Zoo, said that initially Patrick will be separated from the zoo's three other gorillas, all males, but will be able to see and smell them. Eventually Patrick will be introduced to the guys and zoo officials aren't ruling out the possibility that they can live together in a spacious, wooded bachelor pad, Davis said. Born at the Bronx Zoo in 1990, Patrick was abandoned by his mother and then transferred to the Toronto Zoo, where he was hand-raised along with another male about the same age. At age five, he was transferred to Dallas, zoo officials said. Because of his rearing, Patrick gets along well with people and is a popular favorite among visitors and zookeepers at the Dallas Zoo, Holloway said. 'He's beautiful and smart and everyone loves him,' said Ms Holloway. 'We're really sad to see him go but it's for the best for the zoo and for Patrick.' The zoo will have a few days of 'We'll miss ya, Patrick!' celebrations for the ousted primate. Highlights:","output":"1.

Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938. During the Second World War, the United States built Wideawake airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of Saint Helena.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In the 8th year of the 1900s, or 1908, various events and developments occurred around the world. However, let's consider the context provided which is related to industries and territories, such as the manufacturing of fibre from New Zealand flax in 1907, the establishment of Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha as dependencies of Saint Helena, and the construction of Wideawake airport during World War II. Within this context, the events of 1908 are not as directly impactful on these developments, but they did contribute to the broader global environment and might have influenced these territories indirectly. 1. Industrial advancements and the economy: There was significant progress in the realm of industrialization and technologies, which facilitated the growth of various industries and the economy. The Model T Ford was introduced, revolutionizing personal transportation and the automotive industry. Other innovations, such as the first long-distance radio transmission, also enhanced global communication capabilities and had implications for businesses and trade on an international scale. 2. Territories and global politics: 1908 saw some shifts in territorial claims and political alliances around the world. For instance, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to tensions amongst major powers that contributed to the conditions ultimately leading to World War I. The Triple Entente was formalized in 1908, consisting of an agreement between Great Britain, France, and Russia to promote mutual defense and cooperation. This alliance would also have an impact on the eventual outbreak of war in 1914. 3. Exploration and scientific discoveries: In 1908, the Nimrod Expedition to the Antarctic, led by explorer Ernest Shackleton, made significant progress towards the South Pole, ultimately coming within 100 miles of their target before being forced to turn back due to dwindling supplies. These findings motivated further expedition efforts from other parties, including Robert Falcon Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition in 1910.  Additionally, there were important scientific developments in this year, such as the introduction of Cellophane by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger. This new transparent packaging material would impact various industries in the years to come, including food packaging and consumer goods protection. Given this context, while there isn't a direct link to the developments mentioned in the provided excerpt, the events and advancements in the 8th year of the 1900s had broader implications for worldwide industrial growth, territorial disputes, and evolving technologies. These global shifts in power dynamics and industrialization might have contributed in some ways to the subsequent developments that occurred regarding Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, and their related industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. Context: The convenience store chain 7-Eleven transformed 11 of its stores in the U.S. and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts, at the cost of approximately 10 million. 7-Eleven also sold Simpsons-themed merchandise in many of its stores. This included \\"Squishees\\", \\"Buzz Cola\\", \\"Krusty-O's\\" Cereal, and \\"Pink Movie Donuts\\". This promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the altered 7-Eleven stores. Homer performed a special animated opening monologue for the edition of July 24, 2007 of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as part of another promotion.  Promotions also occurred around the world. 20th Century Fox erected a \\"giant pink donut\\" in the town of Springfield in Canterbury, New Zealand to celebrate being named Springfield, while in London a double decker-sized floating inflatable Spider Pig was set up by the Battersea Power Station. In Dorset, England, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure, the Cerne Abbas Giant. This caused outrage amongst local neopagans who performed \\"rain magic\\" to try to get it washed away.  McFarlane Toys released a line of action figures based on the film, EA Games released The Simpsons Game, to coincide with the film's DVD release, although the plot of the game was not based on the film. Samsung released The Simpsons Movie phone, and Microsoft produced a limited edition The Simpsons Movie Xbox 360. Ben & Jerry's created a Simpsons-themed beer and donut-flavored ice cream, entitled \\"Duff & D'oh! Nuts\\". Windows Live Messenger presented their users with the opportunity to download a free animated and static content for use within their conversations. Burger King produced a line of Simpsons toy figures that were given away with children's meals, and ran a series of Simpsons-themed television adverts to promote this. JetBlue Airways held a series of online sweepstakes to win a trip to the film's Los Angeles, California premiere. They also included a channel dedicated to The Simpsons on their planes' in-flight entertainment system. Question: Did they do any Internet marketing. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, internet marketing played a significant role in promoting The Simpsons Movie. The various promotional strategies and tie-ins with well-known brands expanded the film's exposure to the public, including online campaigns. Multiple brands leveraged their digital presence to create buzz and cross-promote the movie. Here are some notable examples: 1. Windows Live Messenger: As part of the promotion, Windows Live Messenger offered users the opportunity to download free animated and static content based on The Simpsons Movie for use within their conversations. This integration increased brand visibility and encouraged users to share the content with others, creating organic user-generated marketing. 2. JetBlue Airways: In addition to their flight-related promotions, JetBlue Airways conducted a series of online sweepstakes, allowing participants to enter for a chance to win a trip to the movie's premiere in Los Angeles, California. Through these digital contests, JetBlue helped create buzz for the movie, enhanced user engagement, and fostered a connection between air travel and the film. 3. Burger King: Burger King released a line of Simpsons toy figures which were included with children's meals, and they promoted these toys through a series of Simpsons-themed television advertisements. However, these efforts were also supported by online presence, such as their website and social media channels, to maximize the reach of their promotions. 4. The Simpsons Game: Although the game's plot was not directly based on the film, EA Games released The Simpsons Game as a tie-in to coincide with the movie's DVD release. Online marketing strategies were employed to promote the game, including trailers, ads on gaming websites, and social media posts, which indirectly bolstered the movie's visibility. 5. Social Media and Viral Marketing: Given the vast global fanbase of The Simpsons, internet users actively shared promotional content related to The Simpsons Movie on social media platforms, discussion forums, and fan sites, contributing to the movie's outreach and generating a sense of anticipation among fans. In conclusion, internet marketing played an essential role in promoting The Simpsons Movie, alongside the various merchandising tie-ins and real-world promotions executed by well-known brands. Leveraging digital channels extended the film's reach, boosted engagement, and increased public awareness of the movie and its related promotional products."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences convey different reasons for Schwartz going to law school. In the first sentence, Schwartz states that they went to law school to do social justice work. This implies that their primary motivation for attending law school was to pursue a career related to addressing social inequalities and injustices. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. This statement implies a different motivation, suggesting that Schwartz's purpose was to pursue a career in corporate law, which typically deals with the legal aspects of business and commercial transactions. It is worth noting that the two sentences do not necessarily contradict each other, as it's possible for someone to have multiple motivations for attending law school. However, without further context or clarification, we cannot determine whether Schwartz had multiple reasons for going to law school or if there is a discrepancy between the two statements.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  I am facing a new situation today: Mark was attending the music festival in his city. First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can follow these steps to answer the question correctly: Step 1: Understand the scenario In the new situation, Mark went to a music festival with two stages. Stage one had music playing at high decibel levels, while stage two had music playing at low decibel levels. Mark liked the latter one (stage two). Step 2: Use the knowledge from the background article From the background article, we know that higher decibel levels correspond to louder sounds and that every 10-decibel increase results in a loudness 10 times greater than the previous level. Step 3: Compare the stages The question asks us to determine which stage is louder. Since stage one had music playing at higher decibel levels, we can conclude that stage one would be louder than stage two. So the correct answer is: Stage one would be louder than stage two."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why does Jon Snow know nothing? \\"Content That Contains Spoilers: Is it mere co-incidence that Melisandre and Ygritte both say the exact same words 'You know nothing' to Jon Snow?\\" Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"While the two questions may appear to be similar, they are not necessarily paraphrases of each other. The first question asks \\"Why does Jon Snow know nothing?\\" and seeks a general understanding of the phrase, its origin, and its significance within the context of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe. The second question, \\"Is it a mere coincidence that Melisandre and Ygritte both say the exact same words 'You know nothing' to Jon Snow?\\" is more specific as it asks whether the use of the phrase by two different characters is a coincidence or has a deeper meaning. To address the first question, the phrase \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" is primarily associated with Ygritte, a Wildling woman Jon Snow falls in love with in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" novels and the subsequent \\"Game of Thrones\\" television adaptation. This phrase became popular due to its frequent use by Ygritte during her interactions with Jon Snow, and it serves to convey Jon's naivety and lack of experience in the wider world and its complexities. Moreover, these words often highlight the differences between the politically charged upbringing Jon experiences at Winterfell and the rough-and-tumble lifestyle Ygritte and other Wildlings have had to endure. However, Jon's naivety and perceived ignorance are illustrated through his hero's journey as he endeavors to learn, grow, and adapt to the circumstances that befall him. As Jon faces a variety of challenges and battles, both literal and metaphorical, he gains insight and wisdom, proving himself as a leader and a skilled tactician. By the series' end, Jon has grown tremendously, distinguishing himself as a mature and knowledgeable individual. Now, addressing the second question, Melisandre, the Red Priestess, also uses the same phrase when speaking with Jon Snow. This occurrence prompts curiosity regarding whether it is a mere repetition or if there is a deeper connection between the two instances. The phrase, as mentioned earlier, exemplifies Jon's inexperience and lack of understanding of matters beyond his own scope. Melisandre's use of the same phrase could signify a few things. First, it may be to remind Jon that he still has much to learn about the world, its people, and the unexplained forces that govern it, especially as Melisandre is known for her connection with the supernatural and her worship of R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Secondly, it could be a way for the author or the showrunners to draw a parallel between the two influential women in Jon's life – Ygritte and Melisandre. These women show Jon different aspects of life and, ultimately, shape his journey in various ways. In conclusion, while the two questions initially present similarities, they diverge in their goals. The first question aims for a broader understanding of the iconic phrase, while the second question seeks a deeper analysis of its significance when spoken by Melisandre and Ygritte. Although both questions are tied to Jon Snow's experiences, each one maintains its unique context."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which magazine is published by German company Bauer Media Group, Heat or Glamour?

The Yum Brands subsidiary is spitting out 185 million to reboot its business, which includes sprucing up some of its 4,300 stores, pushing new Deep South fare, and bringing back in TV ads what a press release calls the \\"brand's greatest asset\\": the ever-popular Colonel Sanders, who died in 1980 and hasn't been seen in a KFC ad in two decades. \\"The Colonel was the consummate American showman,\\" KFC's marketing head tells the Post. \\"He was the person with bling before bling was even a word.\\" For now, KFC is bringing him back to life through SNL alum Darrell Hammond, who issued a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the colonel in a promo KFC tweeted out May 19. There's also what Adweek calls an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and even a Colonel Quest video game. Response on social media has been … mixed. Comments range from excited (\\"@kfc Excellent tv spots! The Colonel is still an excellent spokesman!\\") to disgusted (\\"@kfc I find this extremely offensive to the memory of Colonel Sander I'm going to Popeyes\\") to flat-out frightened (\\"Get outta my timeline with your zombie Colonel selling fried death\\"). But will KFC be bowing to the healthy-eating trend that forced McDonald's to start testing kale in its offerings? Doesn't look that way, the Post notes, though the chain will be using chicken \\"traceability\\" boards in restaurants to say where local chicken came from. Expand this summary.","output":"KFC has recently decided to revive Colonel Sanders, its founder who died in 1980, as part of a 185 million effort to reboot its business and compete with rival fast-food chains like Chick-fil-A. The Yum Brands subsidiary is spending the money on refurbishing some of its 4,300 stores, promoting new Deep South fare, and creating TV ads featuring the popular Colonel Sanders. The late founder of the business will be portrayed by Saturday Night Live star Darrell Hammond, who hosted a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the Colonel on May 19th. The resurrection of Colonel Sanders will also include an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and a Colonel Quest video game.  In addition to reviving Colonel Sanders to boost brand awareness, KFC has been adopting various strategies to turn their business around. Contrary to the healthy-eating trends pursued by some of its fast-food rivals, such as McDonald's testing the use of kale in its products, KFC is focusing on its core product offering: fried chicken. They believe that there are \\"few problems a bucket of fried chicken can't solve\\" and that their customers are looking for \\"something indulgent and something they can share with their family and friends.\\" It remains to be seen if these strategies, along with the better marketing of its products, will enable KFC to regain its market share from Chick-fil-A and other competitors. KFC is also introducing \\"chicken traceability\\" boards in its restaurants in an effort to become more transparent about where the chain sources its chickens. This move could prove fruitful as consumers become increasingly concerned about the origins of the food they consume. Overall, KFC's combination of nostalgia and transparency has the potential to improve the customer experience, enticing both old and new customers to give the chain a try (or a second chance)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

Write a title for this article: Ten years after I am dead and gone, I suspect only two people will give much thought to me, and their names are Henry and Hannah. They're my legacy, so I hope they thrive -- and I sure hope they remember me fondly. Henry and Hannah are, of course, my children, now ages 15 and 19, respectively. Like any parent, I spend a lot of time thinking about my kids, including how I can best help them financially. This isn't simply about coughing up dollars and cents, though the sums involved have been frighteningly large. Rather, what it's really about is passing along values. Yes, I want my kids to be financially successful. But mostly, I want them to be competent, contented managers of their own money, so they don't spend their lives agonizing over their finances and dogged by foolish mistakes. I am not claiming to have the road map for every parent. We all have different values, different incomes and strong ideas about how best to raise children -- and you will likely scoff at some of the things I've done. With that caveat, here are a dozen ways I have endeavored to help my kids financially. If children are to grow up to be successful savers and investors, they need to learn two key skills: How to delay gratification and how to take risks prudently. The first is easily the most important. Indeed, the self-control needed to delay gratification is associated not only with good saving habits, but also with things like succeeding in school and coping better with frustration and stress. Yet this isn't an easy skill to teach. Henry and Hannah grew up spending their parents' cash, so they didn't have much incentive to curb their desires. My response? Make them feel like they're spending their own money. One of my early tricks was the soda game, which I learned about from a reader. When my children were young and we went to restaurants, I would give them a choice: They could have a soda or they could have 1. Henry and Hannah ended up drinking a lot of water. Emboldened by the soda game's success, I looked for other ways to apply the same notion. The breakthrough came when Hannah was 14 and Henry was 10. That was when I opened a savings account for each of them. The accounts came with a cash-machine card. Every three months since then, I have deposited pocket money for them in their savings accounts and, as they have grown older, their clothing allowance as well. That way, they've had to learn to budget for a three-month period. More important, they no longer ask me for money. Instead, if they want to buy something, they have to ask themselves. The effect has been startling. Henry and Hannah almost immediately became more careful spenders. Sound manipulative? You'd better believe it. But I also think of it as financial self-defense. Suppose Henry and Hannah don't learn good money skills and grow up to be financial deadbeats. If they ended up deeply in debt, I can't imagine not helping -- at which point their financial problems would be mine. I haven't just molded Henry and Hannah with financial incentives. I have also used family stories. Values are passed down to our children in the stories we tell. My children may live in an affluent household in an affluent town. But I want them to know that their mother and I struggled financially, and that they will likely have their own struggles. So I talk about the mouse- and cockroach-infested Brooklyn apartment where we all lived while their mother worked on her Ph.D. and we squeaked by on a junior reporter's salary. I tell them about the beaten-up '76 Camaro that used to stall if the traffic light stayed red too long. I recount taking them as toddlers to the \\"toy museum,\\" otherwise known as FAO Schwarz, where we would play with the dolls and the trains but never buy. Instead of regaling my children with these tales, I could simply lecture them about the virtues of thrift. But the stories pack far more punch. I have also encouraged my kids to be suspicious of displays of opulence, whether it's the big house, the fancy car or the designer clothes. The fact is, this sort of spending doesn't lead to lasting happiness, but it can create a heap of financial stress. In belittling conspicuous consumption, I may be a little too strident, but there's a reason. Henry and Hannah may have grown up hearing about the dilapidated Brooklyn apartment. But I grew up hearing a far more powerful story, about my maternal grandfather and his four siblings, who in the 1940s each inherited what today would be millions of dollars. My grandfather's siblings quickly blew the money on fast cars and high living. My grandfather blew his money more slowly, on horses and cattle farming. Either way, the great family fortune was gone, and reckless spending was largely to blame. When my children were young, I opened a variable annuity for each of them. This isn't a product I particularly like, because many have outrageously high annual expenses and charge back-end sales commissions if you sell within, say, the first seven years. Still, there are a few no-load variable annuities with low annual expenses, notably the offerings from Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. Moreover, unlike with an individual retirement account, you don't need earned income to fund a variable annuity, so you can open an account for a toddler. Today, my kids' low-cost variable annuities are each worth some 37,000. I have long been captivated by the idea of starting Henry and Hannah on the road to retirement. Think about it: The dollars I invested when they were youngsters might enjoy six decades of tax-deferred compounding. That's enough to turn 1 into over 100, assuming an 8% annual return. And thanks to the tax penalty on early withdrawals, my children will be discouraged from touching the money before they are 59&frac12;. There are far better investment vehicles than a variable annuity, and my chance came a few years ago. Hannah got a job at a local restaurant, which meant she had earned income. That allowed me to open a Roth individual retirement account for her, which will give Hannah tax-free growth. Instead, I could have funded a regular IRA, where withdrawals are taxable but you get an initial tax deduction. That tax deduction, however, wouldn't have been worth much, given Hannah's low tax rate, so the Roth seemed like a better bet. The money I've stashed in my kids' variable annuities and in Hannah's Roth IRA won't be nearly enough to pay for their retirement, especially once you figure in inflation. But fully funding their retirement was never my aim. Rather, the accounts are intended to be a powerful example, showing my children how money will grow if they are willing to sit quietly with a diverse collection of low-cost funds. When I bought my first home, my parents helped me financially, and I want to do the same for my kids. To that end, I have invested 15,000 for each of them. Even with a decade or more of growth, that 15,000 probably won't be nearly enough for a 20% down payment. But it will give them something to build on. I stashed Hannah's 15,000 in a target-date mutual fund that's geared toward 2010, while Henry's money is in a 2015 fund. I bought those funds knowing my kids probably won't buy homes until five or 10 years after those dates. My thinking: Target-date funds typically have around half their money in stocks as of their target date, and then they continue to become more conservative in the years that follow. By the time my kids need their down-payment money, their target-date funds should be largely invested in bonds. When my kids buy a house, they won't just need a down payment. They will also want to have a good credit score. With that in mind, I listed Hannah as a joint account holder on my Visa card earlier this year. That meant the card's credit history was added to her previously blank credit report. Suddenly, she looked like a model financial citizen. That allowed her, a few months later, to apply for a Discover card on her own. I now have her on a strict regimen, where she charges a small sum each month and dutifully pays it off, thus slowly building up a good credit score. When Henry reaches college age, I will go through the same nonsense with him. This, alas, is necessary nonsense. The reality is, a good credit score will help my kids get a lower mortgage rate, lower insurance premiums and a host of other financial benefits. Full disclosure: I am divorced. But even before my marriage broke up, I was horrified by the way many families blow 20,000 or 30,000 on a single day of celebration for a wedding. To put such spending in context, consider this: According to the Federal Reserve's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, more than 96% of households headed by someone 65 to 74 had some savings -- but the median value of these financial assets, including things like checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, was just 36,100. Spending 30,000 on a party is not one of my values, and I've made sure my kids know it. I have told them I will give them 5,000 toward a wedding or at age 30, whichever comes first. What if they want the 30,000 wedding? They can ask their mother. While an expensive wedding is low on my list of priorities, a good education ranks near the top. My ex-wife and I long ago agreed that we would pay the full cost of our children's undergraduate education. Again, this was something my parents did for me, and we all tend to be heavily influenced by our parents' behavior. There is, however, a limit to my generosity. I have told Henry and Hannah that, if they want to go on to graduate school, they will have to take out loans. I may relent somewhat when the time comes. But I think that there should be some cost to staying in school, so I am not inclined to continue footing the full tab. As you might gather, I have talked to my kids a fair amount about money. They know they will graduate college debt-free, they will get some help toward a house down payment and they will receive just 5,000 toward a wedding. They know about the retirement accounts. I have also promised them 5,000 upon graduating college, to get them started in the world. No doubt some folks will think I'm overly generous, while others might consider me cheap. Many will question my priorities. For instance, folks have told me that they would have skipped the retirement accounts and allocated more toward a house down payment. But, frankly, the precise sums aren't that important. Instead, what I am striving to do is set expectations. By detailing everything to Henry and Hannah, I have made it clear where I think my financial responsibility ends and where theirs will begin. Along the way, I have also endeavored to teach my kids about sensible investing. It's been a slow process. For instance, earlier this decade, I tried a family investment contest. We all picked a mutual fund, I invested 50 a month in each and then we tracked who fared best. I thought the competition would grab their interest, but it wasn't a great success. Maybe Henry and Hannah were too young. Indeed, I have continued to show them their mutual-fund statements as they arrive in the mail, and my kids have grown more interested as they have grown older. They have also become more curious about the financial markets, and I can now chat about investing for at least 30 seconds before they reach for their iPods. I hope enough of this will stick, and they will grow up to be prudent managers of their own money. The potential savings are huge. A financial adviser might charge 1% of a portfolio's value each year, and then recommend mutual funds that cost another 1%. What if my children learn to build their own index-fund portfolios that cost a mere 0.2% a year? When their portfolios hit 1 million, they will pay just 2,000 a year in investment costs, instead of the 20,000 they would be paying if they used an adviser. And, with any luck, they will remember whom to thank. —Mr. Clements, who is based in New York, writes the Getting Going column for The Wall Street Journal.

Please write a short summary for the following article: China's 'Ghost Cities' Have Nothing On The 'Ghost Country' That Is The U.S. Ordos, China’s biggest Ghost city. (Photo credit: iamuday) China’s rise as an economic powerhouse is one of the happiest stories of modern times. Though its citizens once struggled in horrific ways under the brutal thumb of a totalitarian government, now its people are increasingly enjoying the fruits of capitalism. And while its naive detractors would say otherwise, capitalism loves poor people more than anyone as China’s leap from extreme poverty reveals. It’s also important to point out that China’s embrace of capitalism has been profoundly good for all Americans. Particularly amid our own difficult economic times, every day that the Chinese get up to go to work means Americans get a raise for Chinese workers producing all manner of products that cost us less and less as manufacture in China is perfected. That the Chinese have joined an increasingly integrated global economy also means that Americans have been able to migrate to higher paying jobs of the service variety thanks to the ability of Chinese workers to shoulder the manufacturing load of low value goods. Absent our sharing of labor with Chinese workers, Americans would have to do a lot of work that wouldn’t pay very well. To put it more simply, manufacture in China of shoes, socks and t-shirts means that Americans have the time to create Google Google, Microsoft Microsoft and Intel Intel. A better trading arrangement would be hard to fathom. Of course, China’s economic renaissance has predictably generated quite a lot of pessimism about its prospects within the commentariat. Editorial about a coming China ‘bubble’ is arguably as common as is commentary extolling the virtues of its real economic growth. On the ‘bubble’ front, what’s not infrequently mentioned is the existence of ‘ghost cities’ throughout the restless country. Those cities are apparently full of empty residential buildings, and it’s said that buildings without buyers are made possible by government driven loans. The thinking there is that with China’s government desperate to maintain high GDP growth, it’s essentially funding the building of anything so that GDP measures continue to soar. About all this Keynesian construction of buildings for the sake of it, China skeptics have a point; albeit one many of those same skeptics don’t quite grasp. Governments have no resources, so for them to direct limited capital toward activity of no discernible economic value is for governments to lay a wet blanket on actual growth. If the above is doubted, readers need only ask themselves who is better at allocating capital in the United States: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Paul Tudor Jones, or Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, John Boehner, and Nancy Pelosi. The nature of the question makes for an easy answer, at which point it should be stressed to extent that some Chinese cities are entirely the creation of its GDP-focused government, their existence serves as physical evidence that China’s economy is performing at sub-optimal levels. Politicians are many things, but they’re not skilled investors. By definition. The problem with this ankle-biting about China is that it largely ignores the ‘Ghost Country’ that is the United States. This assertion is in no way meant to dismiss the very real economic activity taking place all over the U.S. Lest we forget, governments have no resources other than that which they tax and borrow from us. For our government to spend with abandon, it must be true that Americans are enormously productive such that our wasteful federal minders can tax and borrow away our wealth to begin with. Still, we’re once again a ghost country, and some of our phantoms don’t even live within the 50 states. To see how this is true, consider the military. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon has warned that cuts in defense spending “would cripple our economy” owing to the sad reality that so many owe their paycheck and their business to defense outlays. If we ignore first how very Keynesian many Republicans have become on the subject of defense spending, at present our military protects some of the richest countries in the world in Europe and Asia. For those who saw the documentary, Restrepo, they’re aware that a major part of our military strategy in Afghanistan involves bribing the warlords with jobs programs. Is a great deal of defense spending the wasteful equivalent of ‘Ghost Cities’? It says here that it is. Laws and regulations don’t work at all as evidenced by the collapse of the heavily regulated banking sector in 2008, but all the rules that are legislated and written by politicians and bureaucrats have created massive special interest groups of the accountant, consultant and lawyer variety whose paychecks are almost totally a function of incomprehensible tax and regulatory codes. Without our tax system and a Federal Register that grows by leaps and bounds year after year, each of these facilitator professions would vanish for the most part. Another proverbial ‘Ghost City’ created by our federal government. What about corporate welfare? From subsidies for rich farmers, loans to well-connected businesses like Solyndra, to myriad tax breaks for all sorts of commercial activity approved by Congress, the cost of handouts to corporations is said to run upwards of 160 billion per year. And with Washington, D.C. the center of all this government largesse, cranes are everywhere as developers erect office and residential buildings meant to house and office all those rushing into our capitol city to get a piece of the wealth siphoned off from the actual wealth producers who don’t live in Washington, D.C.; D.C. the Mother of all Ghost Cities. All of which brings us to federal spending itself. This is important when we consider the Keynesian, and as such, very worthless calculation of economic growth that is GDP. The latter counts government spending as an additive aspect of economic growth even though our government can only spend what it takes from the rest of us first. U.S. GDP is measured at around 15 trillion, and government spending accounts for more than a fifth of that 15 trillion. No doubt some of that spending serves an actual and useful constitutional purpose, but a vastly greater amount of it constitutes spending and favor-giving that has no economic raison d’etre other than propping up the proverbial ‘Ghost Cities’ in the U.S., and well outside our borders. It’s arguably true that China’s government has used funds taken from its citizens to build that which has no purpose, but when it comes to creating the most garish of ‘Ghost Cities,’ our own United States has no equal. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the comparison between China's 'Ghost Cities' and the 'Ghost Country' status of the United States. While China's economic growth has been labelled a 'bubble' with many empty residential buildings funded by government-driven loans, the US has its share of issues as well, with military spending, corporate welfare, and federal spending propping up economically unviable projects and sectors. The author asserts that the US must take a closer look at its own economic inefficiencies before criticizing China's so-called 'Ghost Cities'."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What would cause a person to have  headaches? - fall - schizophrenia - made fun of - false information - brain tumor  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"brain tumor"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cuffe and Lyon were called, according to especial orders left by themselves, while even Sir Frederick Dashwood allowed himself to be awakened, to hear the report of the officer of the watch. The first was up quite half an hour before the light appeared. He even went into the maintop again, in order to get as early and as wide a survey of the horizon as he wished.

It's what more and more people have been turning to to release the trouble of modern life. Practically unheard of in the West until 50 years ago, Yoga has become one of the most popular health trends around the world, including prefix = st1 /China. If you search for Yoga on line in Chinese, lots of pages are there to see, most of which are main pages of Yoga clubs. In order to keep fit and lose weight, many girls spend more than 1000 yuan taking part in Yoga classes every month. However, are you really ready for it? There are several things you need to know before you really take it. First, do not force your body too much. Yoga has many difficult poses. They are beautiful and worth boasting if you could finish them. But if you force yourself to do as exactly as an experienced Yoga teacher does, you may hurt your body, instead of strengthening it. Do you remember you original purpose for playing Yoga? It is self -building, not competing.  Second, do some research about the Yoga class that you are to registering. Yoga is new in Chinaand there are not so many certificated well-trained Yoga teachers. Some not well organized clubs just find someone learn a little Yoga and certificate them. But be aware, a non- _ teacher might wrongly guide you and you could not benefit from the classes much except that they force you to exercise your body a bit. Considering about the large amount of money you invest in it, it's worth and reasonable to make sure the teachers in the club are qualified before you join.        Third, it would be better to learn something about nutrition when you practice Yoga. In the very beginning, Yoga was part of the Vedas, bible of the traditional Indian philosophy.

In diesem längeren und detaillierten Antwortformat werde ich die Elemente des Übersetzungstextes erklären. Der Satz beschäftigt sich mit der grundlegenden Idee, dass eine dauerhafte Demokratisierung Europas einen Verfassungsvertrag erfordert, der sowohl praktische als auch ideologische Aspekte berücksichtigt. Hier sind die Schlüsselbegriffe und ihre Übersetzungen ins Deutsche: 1. In the long term (Auf lange Sicht): Dieser Ausdruck betont die Bedeutung eines langfristigen Ansatzes, um eine dauerhafte und gut funktionierende Demokratie in Europa zu erreichen. Es geht darum, über kurzfristige Lösungen hinauszudenken und eine stabile Grundlage für die demokratischen Strukturen zu schaffen. 2. Only a constitutional treaty (nur ein Verfassungsvertrag): Der Text betont die Notwendigkeit eines Verfassungsvertrages als einzige funktionierende Lösung. Ein Verfassungsvertrag ist ein formelles Abkommen, das die Grundstrukturen und Grundsätze für die Zusammenarbeit und Integration der Mitgliedstaaten in einer supranationalen Organisation wie der Europäischen Union festlegt. 3. As practical as it is ideological (sowohl praktisch als auch ideologisch): Diese Phrase zeigt, dass ein erfolgreicher Verfassungsvertrag sowohl pragmatische als auch ideologische Aspekte abdecken sollte. Praktische Elemente beziehen sich auf die tatsächliche Umsetzung und Organisation der supranationalen Zusammenarbeit, während ideologische Aspekte darauf abzielen, die grundlegenden Werte und Prinzipien, auf denen die Europäische Union basiert, zu stärken und zu fördern. 4.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the review, it's quite difficult to determine whether or not I would recommend this app to a friend as the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam\\" doesn't provide any concrete details about the app, its features, or the reviewer's experience with it. There's no evaluation of the app's performance, user interface, functionality, or overall satisfaction from the user. The review is minimal and unclear in expressing any feelings or feedback to understand the app. Furthermore, without any knowledge of the app in question, its purpose, target audience, or its competition, it's hard to make a recommendation. It's important to understand what the app does, how it performs, its customer satisfaction, and its standing in the marketplace to make an informed decision. However, let's analyze different recommendation scenarios by breaking them down: 1. Not at all: If the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam\\" was a negative comment or complaint about the app, it could be an indication to not recommend the app to a friend. But, since the context of the statement is not clear, we cannot assume it is a negative review and base our recommendation on that assumption. 2. No: If the app's functions were deemed subpar or not fulfilling the user's needs, the recommendation might be \\"No.\\" However, as we don't have enough information from the review, it is not possible to determine the app's functionality and performance. 3. Maybe: A \\"Maybe\\" recommendation might be given to an app with mixed reviews, or one that fulfills certain niche needs. Since we lack detailed information about the app's performance and its overall impact on the user, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation could potentially be given, considering the uncertainty. 4. Yes: A \\"Yes\\" recommendation implies that the app is good, provides valuable features, and addresses the user's needs. Since the review doesn't provide any information on whether the app fulfills these criteria, it's hard to definitively say \\"Yes.\\" 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation means the app has met or exceeded the user's expectations and provides an excellent user experience. Again, the review doesn't provide enough information to justify a strong recommendation. In conclusion, based solely on the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam,\\" a definitive recommendation cannot be made. To provide a better recommendation, more in-depth reviews and detailed analysis of the app's features and performance would be necessary. For now, the most suitable response would be \\"Maybe,\\" bearing in mind the limited information available. It is advisable to do more research and gather additional user reviews to get a clearer picture of the app's quality before making a recommendation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: -10*t = -23*t + 30*t - 119 First, let's look at the \\"t\\" parts. We have -23*t and 30*t together. If you have -23 cookies and I give you 30 cookies, how many cookies do you have now?

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Jewish people often faced?\\"  Context: \\"During the Middle Ages, Paris was a center of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"During the Middle Ages, Jewish people in Paris often faced a multitude of challenges and hardships, including persecution, expulsions, and difficult returns to the city. The fluctuating political and social atmosphere significantly impacted the Parisian Jewish community, leading to ongoing adversity. Persecution: The Parisian Jewish community was subjected to discrimination and prejudice during the Middle Ages. This persecution took various forms such as social exclusion, hostility, and animosity from the Christian majority. Anti-Semitic attitudes, prevalent at the time, were fueled by the belief that Jews were Christ-killers and the scapegoating of Jews for widespread economic and social problems. Expulsions and Returns: Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Paris faced numerous instances of expulsions only to be readmitted and expelled again. Notable examples include the 1249 expulsion by King Louis IX, the 1306 expulsion under Philip IV, and the 1394 expulsion ordered by Charles VI. In between these expulsions, French monarchs temporarily allowed the return of Jews for various reasons, including their valuable skills in trade, finance, and medicine. Impact of the French Revolution: The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, proclaimed during the French Revolution, granted full civil rights to the Jewish population in France, making it the first European country to do so. Despite the newfound legal equality, underlying anti-Semitic attitudes persisted, and many Jews continued to face discrimination within society. World War II and the Holocaust: The persecution of Jewish people took a devastating turn during World War II under Nazi occupation. Half of Paris's Jewish population perished in concentration camps, while others managed to escape to safer territories. After the war, France's Jewish community sought to rebuild and remember those who had been lost during the Holocaust. North African Sephardic Immigration: In the 1960s, Paris saw a new wave of Jewish migration as a result of political instability in North Africa. Many Sephardic Jews from countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia settled in Paris, adding a rich diversity to the city's Jewish community, which now constitutes the majority of the Parisian Jewish population. Present-day Jewish community: Today, the Jewish community in Paris is diverse and thriving, with 83 synagogues and cultural institutions scattered throughout the city. Landmarks such as the Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, designed by Hector Guimard, stand as symbols of the resilience and perseverance of the Parisian Jewish community despite the difficult history they have faced over the centuries. In conclusion, Jewish people in Paris have faced significant challenges throughout history, including persecution, expulsions, and the devastating impact of the Holocaust. However, the community has also shown resilience, rebuilding and adapting after each hardship. Today, the Parisian Jewish community is diverse and vibrant, contributing extensively to the city's rich cultural tapestry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Using warm water and soap, apply a washcloth to gently wash out your new piercing. Keeping dirt, grime, and bacteria away from the wound should be enough to prevent infection.  Be sure to clean the piercing after exercise, going outside, cooking, or cleaning. Rubbing alcohol, though it kills bacteria, will dry out your skin and potentially cause an infection. While you could buy saline at the piercing parlor, you can also make it at home with only 2 ingredients. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of distilled water and stir until it dissolves. Submerge your piercing in the saltwater, or soak a clean cotton swab in the water and apply it to the piercing for 20 minutes twice a day. Dirty hands are the number one cause of infection, so always wash your hands before touching or treating your piercing. If you have a piercing that is constantly rubbing on your clothes, wear looser clothing. This is especially true for navel, genital, nipple, or other body piercings. These places are hot-spots of moisture and bacteria that commonly lead to infections. Your piercing is an open wound and it will absorb bacteria much more readily then unbroken skin. Don’t freak out if you see redness or soreness in the first few days after a piercing. This is your body’s normal response to a puncture. Inflammation is common and can be easily treated with an ice-pack and ibuprofen. If the inflammation lasts for more than 3-5 days, however, you may be developing an infection. While it may seem counterintuitive, you should avoid removing the jewelry if you notice signs of active infection, such as pus, since removing the jewelry can cause the piercing to close up and trap the infection inside your body. It's important that the piercing remain open so that it can drain; otherwise, you may develop an abscess or worsen the existing infection.

However, Ray effectively resists sharing any information by citing federal law, Center policy, and state law, which restricts him from discussing any details or even acknowledging the presence of the individual in question or his participation in their program. Throughout the conversation, Ray maintains his stance of not providing any information without proper authorization or legal counsel. He does not answer any of John's questions directly, and even states that he is not prepared to talk until advised by his own lawyer. Thus, it is clear that after the conversation with Ray, John probably did not learn anything new."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As of 2012, there are 26 National Historic Sites of Canada in Winnipeg. One of these, The Forks, attracts four million visitors a year. It is home to the City television studio, Manitoba Theatre for Young People, the Winnipeg International Children's Festival, and the Manitoba Children's Museum. It also features a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, a 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) bowl complex, the Esplanade Riel bridge, a river walkway, Shaw Park, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish. Both the First Nations and more recent Eastern Canadian, European, and Asian immigrants have helped shape Winnipeg's dining scene, giving birth to dishes such as the desserts schmoo torte and wafer pie.The Winnipeg Art Gallery is Western Canada's oldest public art gallery, founded in 1912. It is the sixth-largest in the country and includes the world's largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art. Since the late 1970s Winnipeg has also had an active artist run centre culture. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who named Winnipeg the Bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg?, what is it ?

Sentence 2: It was also distributed in Japan, the United States (where it was first banned, then released in a heavily cut version), England, and France. The components, in terms of the action and locations, are the same. The sequence of locations differs, but the meaning remains the same.  Step 3: Assess if any differences make a significant impact on the meaning. There are two small variations in wording: 1. Sentence 1 uses \\"distributed to\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"distributed in.\\" This change does not affect the overall meaning as both phrases indicate the item was distributed in those countries. 2. Sentence 1 uses \\"published in a heavily cut version\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"released in a heavily cut version.\\" The meaning remains almost the same, but \\"published\\" is usually used for print materials (like books), while \\"released\\" is a more general term that can refer to any kind of distribution, including digital. Conclusion: Overall, the sentences are very similar, and for most practical purposes, they convey the same information. There are some small differences in wording, which might have a slight impact on how the distribution is perceived (with \\"published\\" versus \\"released\\").

He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked them as much as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.Walton's first major composition after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300.After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935.

Build a movie plot around this: What was Freddy's job at the preschool? He was a gardener. A:","output":"Step 1: Introduce the main characters and setup The central character of the movie is Freddy, a kind and introverted man in his 40s who loves nature and enjoys working as a gardener at Little Sprouts preschool. Freddy is awkward when it comes to social interactions but has a genuine and unique connection with plants, often \\"talking\\" to them.  Ms. Esther is the dedicated and warm-hearted principal of the preschool. She has a soft spot for Freddy and sees his unique bond with the plants as a way to teach children about nature and empathy.  The preschool teachers and children love Freddy and deeply appreciate his gardening work, and he has become an essential part of the school community. Step 2: Introduce the conflict A newly hired school administrator, Mr. Johnson, who adheres to strict rules and regulations, doesn't see the value in Freddy's unusual methods of gardening and tries to have him replaced with a modern landscaping company. Freddy faces the possibility of losing his job at the preschool, which brings immense sadness to him and the school community. Step 3: Develop the story Ms. Esther and the preschool teachers decide to support Freddy by showcasing his unique contributions to the school. They organize a special event focused on the importance of nature, creativity, and empathy in education. The event embraces Freddy's unique gardening style, which includes presenting how the plants and flowers have made positive impacts on the children's emotions and learning. Meanwhile, Freddy feels discouraged but decides to give it his best shot when he learns about the supportive event from Ms. Esther. He starts designing an extraordinary garden filled with flowers that represent each child's personality and progress in school. Step 4: Climax and resolution On the day of the event, the preschool hosts multiple guests including parents, teachers from other schools, and school board members. Freddy's garden captures everyone's attention, making the school community immensely proud. As Mr. Johnson observes the positive impact Freddy has on the children, he starts to see the value of Freddy's abilities and his unique connection to nature.  Seeing Freddy's dedication and the strong support of the school community, Mr. Johnson has a change of heart and decides to keep Freddy as the school's gardener.  Step 5: Wrap up the story Freddy's exceptional gardening provides opportunities beyond the walls of the preschool. His refreshing approach to horticulture inspires other schools to incorporate green spaces and nature-related education in their curricula. The movie ends with Freddy teaching a group of children about plants in his now-famous garden, where he continues to foster the growth of both nature and the hearts of those who visit.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who took more overall casualties from bombings?\\" is in \\"The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"The passage provided contains information about the Blitz and its impact on Britain during World War II but does not explicitly answer the question of who took more overall casualties from bombings. It does, however, draw a comparison between the Blitz and the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany.  From the passage, we learn that the British war industries continued to operate and expand despite the bombings, and that the Blitz itself resulted in relatively fewer casualties compared to later bombing campaigns in the war. The passage mentions that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 alone inflicted around 42,000 civilian deaths, which is equivalent to the entire number of casualties during the Blitz. To determine which side of the conflict took more overall casualties from bombings, we would need additional information and data on casualties caused by bombings throughout the entire course of the war on both British and German sides. From the information provided, we can infer that the bombing campaign against Germany had a larger number of casualties in specific instances, such as the bombing of Hamburg in 1943.

Many observers point to Moscow's close ties with Damascus going back to the 1950s as a reason for Russia now acting to defend the al-Assad regime in Syria against its many internal and external opponents. What has apparently been forgotten is that Moscow's ties with Syria have been plagued by tensions and disagreements throughout this entire period. Underpinning the Moscow-Damascus relationship for over half a century now has been a common antipathy toward America, Israel, and the moderate Arab states. But they have also differed on many issues. When Soviet-Syrian relations first became close during the mid-1950s, Moscow seemed to hope the then-powerful Syrian Communist Party might at least share power with the virulently anti-Israeli and anti-Western Baath Party. But the Syrian Baathists feared the communists and agreed to the 1958 merger of their country with Egypt and even accepted the leadership of the latter's ruler, Nasser, partly in order to get his help in suppressing the communists. Moscow restored ties with OPTIONS: - Afghanistan, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - America, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Arab, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Baathists, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Damascus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Egypt, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Israel, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Middle East, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Moscow, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Nasser, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Russia, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Soviet, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syria, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syrian, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syrian Communist Party, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Tartus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - USSR, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - al-Assad, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - anti-Western Baath Party, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there.","output":"Damascus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there.

Randy is always late for the first period while Joseph is always on time as  Select from: [-] Randy is a night owl.. [-] Joseph is a night owl..","output":"Randy is always late for the first period, while Joseph is always on time. The reason for their contrasting punctuality lies in their sleep habits. Randy is a night owl, meaning he tends to stay up late at night, resulting in difficulty waking up early in the morning. This negatively impacts Randy's ability to arrive on time for the first period at school. As Randy's body clock is naturally inclined towards late-night hours, his productivity and alertness do not peak until later in the day. Consequently, it is challenging for him to establish a routine that aligns with early morning school hours. Despite knowing the importance of punctuality, Randy struggles to break free from his night owl tendencies. On the other hand, Joseph is not a night owl. He maintains a consistent sleep schedule, focusing on getting a sufficient amount of rest daily. This enables Joseph to wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day ahead. Joseph's alignment with a healthy sleep pattern allows him to easily adapt to early morning commitments, such as arriving on time for the first period at school. In contrast to Randy, Joseph's peak productivity and alertness occur earlier in the day, making him better suited to adhering to a traditional school schedule. In conclusion, Randy's night owl tendencies contribute to his chronic tardiness for the first period, while Joseph's more balanced sleep habits enable him to consistently arrive on time. It demonstrates the significant impact that sleep patterns have on an individual's ability to function effectively in society, particularly when it comes to punctuality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Destiny James-Keeling, 14, and Megan Marchant, 18, both from Leicester, died when the Vauxhall Astra convertible they were passengers in left the M1 near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on Saturday night. The driver - a woman aged 35 - and an 18-year-old man both escaped with minor injuries after the car struck trees on the embankment at around 7.15pm, Leicestershire Police said.

Bolivia has so much wealth, and yet so much poverty. Translate to German","output":"Bolivien ist ein Land voller Reichtum und dennoch von großer Armut geprägt. In diesem Zusammenhang ist es wichtig, sowohl die Faktoren zu verstehen, die zum Reichtum als auch zur Armut in Bolivien beitragen. Das südamerikanische Land verfügt über eine Vielzahl natürlicher Ressourcen, wie etwa Erdgas, Erdöl, Zinn, Silber und Gold. Diese haben dazu beigetragen, dass der Exportsektor des Landes beachtliche Einnahmen erzielt. Darüber hinaus spielt auch Landwirtschaft, insbesondere der Anbau von Soja, Mais, Zuckerrohr und Quinoa, eine wichtige Rolle für die Wirtschaft. Bolivien zeichnet sich ebenso durch eine reiche kulturelle Vielfalt und eine beeindruckende Landschaft aus, die für den Tourismussektor von großer Bedeutung sind. Trotz dieses Reichtums an natürlichen Ressourcen leiden viele Menschen in Bolivien unter erheblichen sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Problemen, die sich in hoher Armut und sozialer Ungleichheit widerspiegeln. Ein Grund dafür ist die ungleiche Verteilung von Ressourcen und Chancen innerhalb der Bevölkerung, was dazu führt, dass große Teile der Einkünfte nur wenigen zugutekommen. Eine lange Geschichte der politischen Instabilität, Korruption und ineffektiver Regierungsführung hat ebenso zur Armut und sozialen Ungleichheit im Land beigetragen. Die hohen Raten von Landlosigkeit und das Fehlen von Zugang zu grundlegenden Dienstleistungen, wie Bildung und Gesundheitsversorgung, verschärfen die Situation weiter. Um die Armut in Bolivien zu bekämpfen, müssen gleichwertige Chancen für alle geschaffen werden, unabhängig von ihrer sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Stellung in der Gesellschaft. Dazu sollten mehr investiert werden in Bereiche wie Bildung, Gesundheitsversorgung, Infrastruktur, soziale Sicherheit und Armutsbekämpfung. Auf diese Weise können die wirtschaftliche und soziale Ungleichheit verringert werden, während die Lebensbedingungen der ärmeren Bevölkerungsgruppen verbessert werden. Es ist jedoch anzumerken, dass in den letzten Jahren einige Fortschritte erzielt wurden, um die Situation der benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen in Bolivien zu verbessern, insbesondere unter der Präsidentschaft von Evo Morales. Unter Morales wurden Maßnahmen ergriffen, um den Zugang zur Bildung, Gesundheitsversorgung und Grundversorgung wie Wasser und Erdgas zu erhöhen. Trotz dieser Fortschritte besteht jedoch weiterhin ein hoher Bedarf an nachhaltigen Lösungen, um eine gerechtere, inklusivere und wohlhabendere Gesellschaft für alle Menschen in Bolivien zu schaffen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: In order to paint barn doors, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: + dip a brush in paint thinner, then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. + dip a brush in paint, then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered....I think the answer is","output":"Option 2: Dip a brush in paint, then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. In order to paint barn doors, the most reasonable and effective method would be to dip a brush in paint and then apply strokes to the doors until they are completely covered. Here is a detailed explanation as to why this method is more reasonable: 1. Proper coverage: Dipping a brush in paint ensures that you get the adequate amount of paint needed to properly cover the surface of the barn doors. By dipping the brush in paint, you can control the amount of paint that you pick up and apply. This, in turn, contributes to a consistent paint application and finish. 2. Efficiency: By using paint directly, you work more efficiently since you do not need to go through an extra step of diluting the paint with thinner. This saves time and effort in the long run. 3. Durability: Using paint without diluting it with paint thinner ensures that the barn doors receive a thicker and more durable coat of paint. A more durable coat of paint will stand up to wear and tear and protect the doors better over time. 4. Color consistency: Applying paint directly without dilution maintains the color consistency of the paint. If you dilute the paint with thinner, it can change the hue or shade of the paint, making it challenging to achieve a uniform and desired color on the barn doors. Let's now briefly address why the first option is not as reasonable. Option 1: Dip a brush in paint thinner, then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. Using paint thinner is not the most reasonable method to accomplish this goal for these reasons: 1. Inadequate coverage: Diluting the paint with thinner may make it more difficult to achieve proper coverage on the barn doors. The paint will be less dense and may require additional coats to achieve the desired appearance. 2. Time-consuming: As mentioned above, dilution with thinner may necessitate additional coats of paint adding to the time and effort required to complete the task, making this method less efficient. 3. Reduced durability: A diluted coat of paint will be less durable, offering less protection for the barn doors. 4. Color inconsistency: Diluting paint can lead to inconsistencies in color, making it challenging to achieve a uniform appearance. In conclusion, the most reasonable method for painting barn doors is to dip a brush in paint and then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. This option ensures proper coverage, time efficiency, better durability, and color consistency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Pick from: (I) description; (II) entity; (III) abbreviation; (IV) human; (V) numeric; (VI) location;","output":"God is a concept that transcends simple categorization, encompassing a myriad of dimensions including description, entity, and even human-made interpretations. Here, I will present different aspects to provide a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God. (I) Description: From a descriptive standpoint, God represents the ultimate source of goodness, power, and knowledge. Generally, God is conceived as the supreme being, the creator of the universe and everything in it, and the all-knowing, all-powerful, and ever-present entity. Many religions and belief systems contain some concept of God, though their interpretations and descriptions may differ significantly. God is often described using various attributes, such as omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence. Furthermore, God is frequently portrayed as possessing moral perfection, and as the defeater of evil. Across diverse belief systems, God is generally depicted as compassionate, loving, and forgiving, although descriptions of divine wrath and retribution are not uncommon. (II) Entity: God can also be seen as an entity or a group of entities. In monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, God is represented as a single, all-powerful being, who exercises ultimate control over creation. In contrast, polytheistic religions like Hinduism and ancient Greek and Roman religions encompass multiple gods and goddesses who possess unique abilities and dominion over specific aspects of the universe. Gods in these belief systems may be entities with anthropomorphic personalities, but they can also take the shape of abstract principles. (III) Abbreviation: Although \\"God\\" is not an abbreviation in any formal sense, it can symbolize the divine being or force present in various spiritual practices. \\"God\\" might stand for a more significant, foundational concept that supersedes specific religious or cultural characterizations. This abbreviation-like usage allows for a common understanding of a supreme being while still respecting the diverse beliefs held by people around the world. (IV) Human: Throughout history, some people have been regarded as gods or extensions of gods, as seen in Roman and Greek mythologies where demigods were believed to be half human, half god. Egyptian pharaohs were thought to be divine, and some individuals have claimed to be divine themselves, such as cult leaders and self-proclaimed prophets. It is essential to recognize that when \\"God\\" is associated with a human, it typically results from that person's claims or other people's beliefs in that individual's divinity, rather than the actual existence of a deity assuming human form. (V) Numeric: A numeric representation of God can be found in the concept of sacred numbers, which are believed to possess divine attributes or significance in certain religious or spiritual traditions. For example, in Christianity, the number 3 is considered sacred due to its association with the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). In Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, the number 10 represents the Sefirot, ten attributes through which God interacts with the world. However, these numeric representations serve more as symbols of divine traits or principles, rather than as direct representations of God. (VI) Location: The concept of God is not tied to a specific location, as it generally encompasses an omnipresent and omnipotent being. Nonetheless, there are certain places considered sacred or divine due to their association with God or gods. Sacred sites might include temples, churches, mosques, shrines, or natural landmarks such as mountains or rivers. These locations are seen as places where the divine is particularly present and where humans can seek spiritual growth and connection to the divine. In conclusion, the term God and its understanding encompass various aspects, such as description, entity, and, to some extent, human association and interactions. The concept of God is complex and varied, as it is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and spiritual belief systems across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It published a mix of erotic fiction and avant-garde literary fiction, and is best known for the first print of Vladimir Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\".  - Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (, also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist and entomologist. His first nine novels were in Russian, and he achieved international prominence after he began writing English prose.  - The cut-up technique (or \\"découpé\\" in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.  - The Beat Generation is a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-World War II era. The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s. Central elements of Beat culture are rejection of standard narrative values, spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration.  - William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914  August 2, 1997) was an American novelist, short story writer, satirist, essayist, painter, and spoken word performer. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author who wrote in the paranoid fiction genre, and his influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians, and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee.  - Sinclair Beiles ( b. Kampala , Uganda , 1930 - 2000 , Johannesburg ) was a South African beat poet and editor for Maurice Girodias at the Olympia Press in Paris . He developed along with William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin the cut - up technique of writing poetry and literature . Beiles was involved with American beat poets Allen Ginsberg , Gregory Corso and Brion Gysin , and Burroughs at the legendary Beat Hotel in Paris . The photographer Harold Chapman recorded this period in his book The Beat Hotel ( Gris Banal , 1984 ) . He co-authored Minutes to Go with Burroughs , Gysin and Corso ( Two Cities Editions , 1960 ) . Beiles helped edit Burroughs ' Naked Lunch . He worked with the Greek artist Takis and read his magnetic manifesto -- \`\` I am a sculpture ... I would like to see all nuclear bombs on Earth turned into sculptures '' -- in 1962 in Paris at the Iris Clert Gallery . At this event he was famously suspended in mid-air by a magnetic field from a powerful magnet in a sculpture developed by Takis . Beiles attributed his subsequent mental instability to this experience even though he insisted that Takis provide him with a helmet to protect his head from the magnetic field . Beiles wandered through Europe , including a spell in London and settled in the Greek islands during the 1970s . He fought frequent bouts of depression , mental illness and drug addiction . He was married to the South African poet and artist Marta Procter . In later life he returned to South Africa and was associated with the Johannesburg - based Gallery III group of poets , writers , composers and performance artists and lived in the central and artistic district of Yeoville . He and the South African columnist and playwright Ian Fraser formed a friendship which lasted many years .

Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection.

Here is a hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that Mr. Whittington forcefully brought his fist down upon the desk, producing a bang. This action can be interpreted as him performing a rapid movement with his fist to strike the desk, creating a loud noise as a result. The hypothesis posits that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. If we accept the premise as true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is true as well. This is because the premise directly demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to bang on the desk with his fist – an action that served as the key component for the resulting sound. In this scenario, the premise serves as evidence supporting the hypothesis. When we analyze the provided premise and assume it to be true, it becomes clear that Mr. Whittington did indeed use his fist to bang on the desk, thereby validating the hypothesis. To further elaborate, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components: 1. Premise: Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.    a. Mr. Whittington performed an action (bringing his fist down).    b. He did this upon a desk.    c. This action resulted in a loud noise (a bang). 2. Hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk.    a. Mr. Whittington possessed the ability (was able) to perform an action.    b. The action involved using his fist.    c. The intended result of the action was to bang on the desk. When comparing the core components of both the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe the following: - The subjects (Mr. Whittington) and the core actions (using his fist to bang on the desk) align in both statements. - The premise demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to perform the action by providing a specific instance (bringing his fist down upon the desk with a bang). - The intended result of the action (a bang) further validates the assertion in the hypothesis that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because the premise effectively substantiates the claim made in the hypothesis through direct demonstration of the action and its intended result."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas... The answer is:","output":"Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge, and Yellow toadflax are the non-native plant species considered noxious in the Shoshone National Forest.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that the Viola is named after?  The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Title: Love Exposure Movie plot: Chapter 1: YuYu Honda, a young teenage Catholic is attempting to live his life in a faithful and orderly manner. Before his mother dies, she makes him promise that he will marry a woman as beautiful as The Virgin Mary. His father, Tetsu, becomes a devout Catholic priest following the death of Yu's mother, and operates his own church. As he grows up, Yu comes to realise that only marrying Mary will suit him, and goes on his search for Mary. A woman named Kaori becomes obsessed with Tetsu, and forces her love on him, which he eventually reciprocates. Together, the three move into a new house where their relationship is kept a secret. Tired of this secrecy, Kaori leaves the house, which leaves Tetsu broken and depressed. He makes Yu come to confessional every day, and demands to know his sins. Yu, unable to think of any sins he might have committed, lies, but is caught. He decides to deliberately commit sins and confess them to his father.Tetsu becomes displeased with this, and moves to his church, almost disowning Yu as his son. Yu falls in with a gang of three delinquent boys named Takahiro, Yuji and Senpai, who teach him to steal, fight and live on the streets, amused by his need to commit sins only to confess them to his father. They suggest he try something more provocative, which a Catholic priest would not tolerate, and take him to a man named Llyod, who specialises in a \\"kung fu\\" technique of taking voyeuristic \\"panty shot\\" photos of girls in public. After great training, Yu becomes an expert himself at taking \\"panty shot\\" photos, but unlike others, does not do it for perverted reasons, but simply out of a need to commit sins. When he confesses his activities to his father, Tetsu beats him as a father would beat his son, which pleases Yu. He refuses to take Yu's confession, and throws him out of the church, where Yu piously prays to God even in the rain.A gang of three girls, led by Koike pass him and he photographs them, but is caught.

Text: The pressure-gradient force is the force which results when there is a difference in pressure across a surface. In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere. Question: with regard to the pressure gradient force air will always move from low to high pressure? Available options: A). no B). yes","output":"A). no The pressure-gradient force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. This means that air will always move from high to low pressure, not from low to high pressure as stated in the question.

(CNN) -- Tito Joseph \\"TJ\\" Jackson, who on Wednesday was named temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three children, was inspired by his famous uncle to form a singing group with his brothers. TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.

Answer a question about this article: Hitler's interest in this strategy forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, Directions for operations against the British War Economy, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries. What was a top priority of Directive 23?","output":"Directive 23, titled \\"Directions for Operations Against the British War Economy,\\" was issued by Adolf Hitler on 6 February 1941, as a result of his interest in reviewing the air war strategy against Britain. Under Directive 23, the top priority was to focus on aerial interdiction of British imports by sea. This essentially meant that the German air forces (Luftwaffe) would concentrate their efforts on disrupting and hindering the flow of essential goods and resources to Britain by attacking and targeting maritime shipping and transportation routes.  Before Directive 23, the strategy of attacking Britain's sea communications had been recognized but was deprioritized due to Operation Eagle Attack and the subsequent Battle of Britain. These events diverted German airpower towards the campaign against the Royal Air Force (RAF) and its support structures, with the aim of achieving air superiority over Britain. As a result, interdiction of sea communications was considered of lesser significance compared to bombing land-based aircraft industries by the German High Command (OKL). Therefore, Directive 23 marked a strategic shift in the German approach to the Battle of Britain by emphasizing the importance of targeting and disrupting Britain's vital maritime trade and communication routes to weaken the British war economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Variety: A big city offers a wider range of dining options, cuisines, and restaurants compared to a small town. This allows individuals to try new culinary experiences and enjoy a broader range of flavors and tastes. 2. Quality: Restaurants in bigger cities often have access to better ingredients, skilled chefs, and state-of-the-art cooking equipment. This results in a higher overall quality of meals and dining experiences. 3. Atmosphere: Dining in a big city can also come with benefits in terms of ambiance, entertainment, and overall atmosphere. Many restaurants in cities often have a more vibrant atmosphere with better lighting, decor, and music, making the dining experience more enjoyable. 4. Special occasions: When people want to celebrate special occasions or have a particularly memorable night out, they may be more likely to head to a big city where there are more upscale, unique, or highly-rated dining establishments to choose from. 5.

Q: Abstract: Helicobacter hepaticus has been reported to induce colitis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in several different murine models. The aim of this study was to determine if H. hepaticus will cause colitis in monoassociated mice lacking the interleukin-10 gene (IL-10(-/-) mice) and potentiate colitis in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) IL-10(-/-) mice. Germfree IL-10(-/-) mice on either a mixed (C57BL/6 x 129/Ola) or inbred (129/SvEv) genetic background were monoassociated with H. hepaticus ATCC 51448 by oral feeding and rectal enemas. In a second experiment, germfree IL-10(-/-) mice were colonized with stool from SPF mice that harbored or did not harbor endogenous H. hepaticus. After 7 to 9 weeks of colonization, weight loss and mortality were assessed, the colon was isolated for histology and IL-12 secretion, and mesenteric lymph node cells were assessed for T-cell activation markers. It was found that IL-10(-/-) mice monoassociated with H. hepaticus for up to 16 weeks showed almost no histologic colitis or increased IL-12 production. SPF IL-10-knockout mice had no significant difference in weight loss, mortality rate, histologic scores, colonic IL-12 secretion, or T-cell activation with or without H. hepaticus. We conclude that H. hepaticus does not induce or potentiate disease in our IL-10(-/-) mice and therefore is not required to induce colitis in genetically susceptible hosts..

It was dredged and widened in 1974 , built with gravel roads on each side of the channel .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia appear to convey similar information, they do possess subtle differences in their meaning and structure which affect the overall interpretation of the event described. 1. \\"It was built and widened in 1974, with gravel roads dredged on each side of the canal.\\" In this sentence, the primary action is \\"built and widened,\\" which implies that the subject (\\"it\\") was both created and expanded in 1974. The additional information about the gravel roads being dredged on each side of the canal serves as supplementary context. Dredging typically involves removal of sediments or other materials from a water body to improve depth or navigability. Here the use of \\"dredged\\" in reference to gravel roads suggests that materials were removed in the process of constructing the roads adjacent to the canal. 2. \\"It was dredged and widened in 1974, built with gravel roads on each side of the channel.\\" In this sentence, the primary actions are \\"dredged and widened,\\" meaning \\"it\\" was primarily subjected to improvement through sediment removal and expansion in 1974. The phrase \\"built with gravel roads on each side of the channel\\" could be interpreted as the initial construction phase of the subject. Furthermore, the use of \\"channel\\" instead of \\"canal\\" adds ambiguity: channels can refer to natural or human-made watercourses, whereas canals are usually human-made. While the meaning is largely similar, in this sentence the focus is on dredging as a primary action, with the addition of gravel roads serving as supplementary contextual information. In conclusion, the two sentences share a similar overall meaning regarding a watercourse's development in 1974, yet the distinction in the primary and secondary actions, as well as the choice of \\"canal\\" versus \\"channel\\", can impact how these events are understood. The first sentence emphasizes construction and expansion, noting that gravel roads were dredged on either side, while the second places focus on dredging and widening, mentioning the building of gravel roads as additional information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is seen as either the perfect example of artisanal food or as a strange, smelly dairy product best avoided unless it's topping a pizza or hamburger.      Of course, it’s not really that simple. Cheese has been an important source of protein for centuries. It has a long shelf life and can be produced indefinitely if you have a healthy, milk-producing animal. Where cows aren't readily available, goat's milk is a typical substitute.      However, the world's most expensive and unusual cheese comes from neither cows nor goats.      Pule cheese (pronounced pullay) is made only in Serbia and fetches the highest price of any cheese on Earth. In 2012, a batch of pule was sold for the “discounted” price of 576 per pound. On the open market, gourmands can expect to pay well over 1,000 per pound. The milk used to make this cheese comes from a very unusual source: the endangered Balkan donkey.      The process of producing pule is what makes it literally worth its weight in gold. For starters, there are no automated milking machines for donkeys. The animals have to be milked by hand three times per day. They also produce a very small amount of milk; it takes more than 15 donkeys to yield 1 gallon of milk per day, and roughly 3.5 gallons of milk make 1 pound of pule.      The story behind pule's spike in popularity goes beyond its source. A rumor involving one of Serbia's most famous sons earned the little-known cheese plenty of media buzz in 2012. Tennis star Novak Djokovic was said to have used his tournament winnings to purchase the entire supply of pule — a rumor that later turned out to be false.      The world's supply of pule comes from a herd of Balkan donkeys that live on the Zasavica Special Nature Preserve. Once extensively used as pack animals by rural Serbs, the domesticated donkeys were replaced with modern modes of hauling and slaughtered or turned out during tough economic times. Today, workers at the Zasavica preserve see pule production as a way to promote the conservation of the endangered species.      In addition to cheese, donkey's milk is also an ingredient in beauty products. Ancient Egyptian queen Cleopatra is famously said to have used the milk as a skin treatment.      So how exactly does pule taste? A crumbly white cheese, it is known for its intense flavor and natural saltiness. It will likely appeal to cheese aficionados, but for others, a block of cheddar or Swiss from the local supermarket is probably money better spent.      Related stories on MNN: ||||| Photo      Donkey cheese is irresistible, or at least articles about it are. A week ago, several British newspapers, notably The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail, reported that Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player, had bought the entire world supply of pule, a Serbian donkey cheese, for his restaurants.      The cheese, produced on a lone farm on Zasavica, a nature reserve west of Belgrade, had already made a small splash for its exorbitant price. At 1,000 euros per kilo, or about 600 per pound, it seemed to have inched past moose cheese to top the list of the world’s most expensive cheeses.      Now it was poised for stardom, lofted skyward by Mr. Djokovic’s golden racket. On Sunday, it made an appearance on the NPR quiz show, “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” It was offered as the one true story among three wildly improbably choices.      One problem. Mr. Djokovic has never bought so much as a gram of pule.      Responding to a series of e-mail questions about pule, Jovan Vukadinovic, a manager at Zasavica, concluded with a rather deflating piece of information. “Novak Djokovic never bought our cheese,” he wrote.      What happened, he explained, was this: Slobodan Simic, the farm’s donkey breeder, left a sample of the cheese with the manager of Mr. Djokovic’s restaurant in Belgrade, offering to let the restaurant have an exclusive on the product. He still awaits a reply. “That is the only truth, and the rest are made up by journalists,” Mr. Vukadinovic wrote.      The Daily Mail, hot on the trail of pule, sent a reporter named Robert Hardman to Serbia for a tasting. When he discovered that the Djokovic story was shaky, he buried the bad news deep in the story and swathed it in a few layers of obfuscation, suggesting that Mr. Simic is now “waiting to clinch the deal.”      The waiting seems more likely than the clinching.      But if Mr. Djokovic does want to corner the donkey-cheese market, the farm plans to produce 100 kilos of it next year. That would set Mr. Djokovic back about 132,000, or about two serves and a cross-court return.      About the cheese. Pule, which means “foal” in Serbo-Croatian, made its international debut in September at the annual cheese show in Frome, Somerset. Connoisseurs scratched their heads. The Balkan asses that produce the milk are traditional, but the cheese itself is new, an idea hatched by Mr. Simic as a way of bringing attention to his donkeys. He supplies the milk, and Stevo Marinkovic, a cheesemaker at Beocapra, a nearby goat farm and dairy, makes the cheese.      Charles Campion, a British food writer who sampled pule at the show, described it as tasting not unlike a Spanish manchego, but with “a fusty-musty flavor.”      A quick survey of cheese shops, markets, cheese publications and Serbian restaurants in the United States and abroad uncovered a knowledge deficit. Rare was the expert who had even heard of donkey cheese, much less tasted it, with the notable exception of Roland Barthélemy, the president of the International Cheese Guild.      We reached out to Greg O’Neil, an owner of Pastoral, a specialty cheese shop in Chicago, which has the largest Serbian population in the United States. “We have never been asked for it, and I’m not sure if it’s salable in the U.S.,” he said.      “I’ve eaten yak cheese from Mongolia,” he added, helpfully. “Very gamy.”      Most of those who were queried either fell silent or laughed in disbelief. One or two knew of it by hearsay. “It’s kitschy, expensive and Eastern European,” said Julia Lowry, a cheesemonger at Cowgirl Creamery in San Francisco.      At City Fresh Market in Chicago, Danny Kovacevic and his brother, Ray, specialize in Eastern European foods. They have feta cheeses in all varieties. They have kaymak, a soft cheese sold salted and unsalted. They do not have donkey cheese.      “Back home, from Montenegro all the way down the Dalmatian coast, people drank the milk,” Danny Kovacevic said. “It was a home remedy, especially for kids with bronchitis. I have an 86-year-old aunt who drank it. But cheese?” His voice trailed off.      Well, there’s cheese now. And Mr. Simic is said to be working on a line of donkey-milk liqueurs. ||||| “Well and what’s cheese? Corpse of milk,” said James Joyce. Cheese is probably the most popular dairy product in the world and there are a lot of “corpses of milk” around: some of which are rare and incredibly expensive.      Here are the 5 highest priced cheeses in the world.      5. Caciocavallo Podolico – 70 euro/kg; US 42/pound      This cheese, meaning “Horse Cheese,” is traditional and very popular in the south of Italy. It is not made from horse’s milk, rather its name originates from the fact that in the past, it was hung from horses so it could be transported during curing. Caciocavallo has a pear shape and a creamy white filling. It comes from the milk of a rare Italian breed of cow (only 25,000 exist) called the Podolica, which only lactates from May to June.      4. Bitto storico – 245 euro/kg; US 150/pound      This rare Italian cheese is aged and prestigious: the oldest block is from 1996 and is stored in the Sanctuary of Bitto, in Gerola Alta, where the cheese is produced. A whole cheese aged 16 years and weighing 20 kg (44 pounds) was sold to ProFood Hong Kong, which will distribute small portions of the cheese to several resellers all around China.      3. Moose Cheese – Over 500/kg; US 300/pound      Produced in Sweden by the Moose House, this cheese is made only from the milk of Gullan, Haelga, and Juno. These three cows were abandoned by their mother and adopted by the Johannson family. Moose only lactate from May to September and require the most tender of handling during milking since disturbances can cause the animals to get flustered and dry-up. Each animal produces about 5 liters (1.3 gallons) of milk per day, so each year the farm can only offer 300 kg (660 pounds) of cheese. The cheese contains 12 percent fat and 12 percent protein.      2. White Stilton Gold – 700 euro/kg ; US 420/pound      One of the few British cheeses labeled PDO (Protected Denomination Origin), White Stilton Gold is made by Clawson, the producer of White and Blue Stilton. Stilton is called ‘The King” of British cheeses and only six creameries in the world are allowed to make it. The White Gold, suitable for dessert, is as creamy as the plain White, with the difference that it is crumbly—and it contains real gold.      1. Pule (or “donkey’s pet” in Serbian) – 1,000 euro/kg; US 600/pound      Only available on demand, this unique cheese strengthens the immune system, since it is low in fats and rich in vitamins and proteins. It is made of smoked donkey’s milk, and is produced only in the Balkans by Zasavica Special Nature Reserve, home to a hundred donkeys. They affirm that the high price is due to the amount of milk required to make 1 kg of cheese: 25 liters (3 gallons to make 1 pound). Female donkeys are milked manually, since there are no suitable machines to do the job. ||||| Slobodan Simić lounged on the crude wooden bench in Zasavica Special Nature Reserve’s dining room like the caterpillar from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, holding court and puffing on the quarter-bent Calabash-style briar pipe that dangled delicately from his teeth. Tanned creases ran down his face like tributaries, and his eyes sparkled with mischief.      “Rakia?” he said, offering me a shot of the strong Balkan brandy that is often drunk in the morning, even before coffee.      “Ne, hvala,” I replied, shaking my head and thanking him. Instead, I accepted a cup of thick Turkish coffee accompanied by a shot glass of donkey milk from Zasavica’s herd. It was my first time tasting the sweet milk; I was even more eager to try the donkey cheese, a delicacy I’d learned about a few years back when rumours swirled that Serbian tennis ace Novak Djokovic was buying up their entire stock for his restaurants. Although the rumours were untrue, they brought global attention to Zasavica – and Serbia.      Despite being a nature lover, Simić never set out to create a farm. Twenty years ago, the former MP-turned-conservationist remembered that he’d heard about some wetlands in west-central Serbia. His ex-wife’s parents, who lived in a nearby village, took him to see them.      “I fell in love immediately,” he said.      Zasavica, named after the river that runs through it, is located just 90km northwest of Belgrade, but the 1,825-hectare area was virtually undiscovered. The place is ripe for bird watching, and in the summer, hues are so vibrant they seem otherworldly. With the help of his political contacts, Simić transformed the wild marshland into a nature reserve in 1997.      Three years later, Simić was at a fair in the nearby town of Ruma and saw some abused Balkan donkeys. No longer needed for work or transportation, they’d been beaten and were in bad shape. He had the idea to rescue them and bring them to Zasavica. Today, 180 Balkan donkeys, smaller than most donkeys and marked with crosses on their backs, roam the verdant marshland. Other native animals were added, including the Mangalica, related to the Hungarian “curly pig”, and the Podolian cow, originating from the European wild cow. Beavers were also reintroduced to the area.      “We lost contact with animals, and we need that contact,” Simić said.      But I’d come for the donkeys. More specifically, for the donkey milk cheese, which is the most expensive cheese in the world due to the extremely low milk yield of the magarica (female donkey): just 300 millilitres per day. Rich in vitamins and minerals, donkey milk is believed to slow down the ageing process and has been used as an immunity booster in the Balkans since ancient times. Cleopatra allegedly even bathed in it. It is also purported to boost virility.      “If you drink our milk, you can even sleep with your own wife,” joked Simić, who has been married three times.      Simić had the notion to produce donkey milk cheese a few years ago.      “He is full of crazy ideas, but he is always right,” said farm manager Jovan Vukadinović, a formidable former traffic police chief with a near-white moustache that resembled a bristle brush.      No one had produced cheese from donkey milk before, and it took some experimentation. Stevan Marinković, a dairy technologist, was brought in to consult. Donkey milk doesn’t have enough casein to make cheese, so he compensated by adding goat milk to the mix. The winning formula, which Marinković is in the process of patenting, turned out to be 60% donkey milk and 40% goat milk.      But despite there being no established rules for donkey milk (or donkey milk cheese) in Serbia, concerns arose over the use of unpasteurized milk, and Zasavica was forced to stop factory production of the cheese.      In the meantime, until official regulations are determined, local cheese makers Zoran Nedić, Momčilo Budimirović and his assistant, Milena, are producing small amounts of donkey cheese with milk pasteurized at low levels for Zasavica in a room adjacent to Budimirović’s kitchen in the nearby village of Glušci.      I sat at Budimirović’s dining table with Nedić, Vukadinović and Simić, who were chatting in rapid Serbian. Domaće crno vino (domestic red wine) and a wedge of white cheese were on the table.      “Is this donkey cheese?” I asked. Vukadinović shook his head. “Goat cheese, so you can taste the difference.” It was tangy and crumbly, with a dark kora od hrast (oak bark) rind.      Then, without much ceremony, Budimirović brought out a much smaller bell-shaped chunk of magareći sir (donkey cheese). It had a yellowish tinge, and was less crumbly than the goat cheese. This piece, the size of a cupcake, would sell for 50 euros, I was told. Nedić cut me a slice. Its flavour was sweet, clean and mild, unlike any cheese I had ever tasted.      We headed to the cheese room to see how it was made. That day, the trio of cheese makers were crafting goat cheese, but they explained donkey cheese is essentially made the same way – although the exact method is a secret. Rennet is added to the milk to help it coagulate, and the curds are strained and hand packed into moulds. The cheese stays in the mould for 24 hours, then it is removed and refrigerated in a large trailer cooler in Budimirović’s yard.      This media cannot be played on your device.      Zasavica also sells donkey milk cosmetics, such as donkey milk soap and anti-ageing face creams, which contain essential fatty acids and high levels of vitamin A; and donkey milk liqueur that tastes like milky Limoncello.      The reserve, which has been supported by international grants, is working to become self-sustaining. Selling animal products is part of that plan, as is camping: Zasavica was rated among the 100 best campsites in Europe in 2013 and 2014.      We made something in the middle of the nothing      “We made something in the middle of the nothing,” Vukadinović said. “We always have to find new ways to survive. It’s easy when they say ‘sustainable tourism’, but it’s not easy. We want to be the best. We know we can’t change the world, we can’t change Serbia, but we always want to do just a little better than normal. That is our mission.”      Just before I left, Vukadinović and I took a walk through the reserve. Donkeys grazed on shrubbery and frolicked in the grass. They nuzzled, cleaned each other and nursed. A grey donkey ambled toward me.      “She’s pregnant,” Vukadinović said. “A magarica can be pregnant for more than a year.”      I reached out and rubbed her forehead, fingering her coarse hair. She nuzzled my hand and leaned her body into mine. When we turned to leave she followed me, nudging for more attention.      “They are very intelligent and social,” Vukadinović said. He bent down and hugged her neck. “This is very good for the stress.”      We sat down at a picnic table for lunch. Sun illuminated the flat landscape, highlighting various shades of green – moss, pine, fern ­­– against a clear blue sky. Frogs sang. A stork soared overhead, landing on her nest atop Zasavica’s 18m-high watchtower.      Vukadinović brought out a plate of cured meats: Mangalica sausage, speck and donkey sausage. I cringed a little. “Try it,” he urged, gesturing to the donkey sausage.      This was one of their products I had not planned to sample. “How do you choose which donkeys are made into sausage?” I said. He explained that male donkeys sometimes become interested in their daughters, and then “it’s sausage time for them.”      I speared a mottled slice with a toothpick. The fatty meat was tough and slightly gamey. Even eating an incestuous donkey felt wrong after communing with these gentle creatures – but Zasavica embraces the cycle of life, replete with its imperfections.      Here you can go back to a way of living that has all but disappeared, when people cured their own meats and made their own cheese. You can experience virgin nature. You can believe, even for a moment, the local legend: on this land there was too much sun from Christ, which forever marked the Balkan donkey with a cross pattern on its coat, running down its spine.

It is the most expensive cheese in the world because it comes from the milk of the endangered Balkan donkey. These donkeys have to be milked by hand three times a day, and they don't give a lot of milk, so it takes many donkeys to make just a little bit of cheese. To make one pound of pule cheese, you need around 3.5 gallons of milk! Pule cheese is known for its strong flavor and natural saltiness. It is very special and is only made in one place on Earth, so it costs a lot of money to buy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is an article: Those gigantic jackpots set people dreaming. I’m not immune to lottery fever. I hadn’t bought a lottery ticket of any kind for years, until last January, when the Powerball jackpot amounted to nearly 1.6 billion. That was one awesome number. We began talking about it at work. Two colleagues and I split a few tickets. We understood that we had almost no chance of winning, and didn’t care: It was fun. Behavior like ours seems to account for the rapid surge in lottery sales, bringing jackpots to a higher and higher level, Mr. Mehta suggests. Once the jackpot reaches a certain threshold — somewhere in the hundreds of millions, these days — people begin talking and rushing to buy tickets, including people who don’t typically buy lottery tickets, and the jackpot soars even higher. I have no problem with that on a personal level. In fact, if the lottery exceeds 1 billion again, I’ll probably buy a ticket again. I have dreams, too. But Mr. Mehta persuaded me to crunch the numbers to see what effects the government-sponsored lotteries are having on people who buy tickets regularly. The results are troubling. Consider that for state-run lotteries as a whole, only about 60 cents of every dollar goes back to ticket buyers in the form of winnings, an analysis of United States Census Bureau data shows. The flip side is that in the long run, players as a group lose about 40 percent of the money they put into the lottery, and the chances of a big win are vanishingly small. For the July 30 Powerball drawing, for example, the lottery sold roughly 74 million tickets across the country, the data indicates. In addition to the 487 million jackpot winner, lottery statistics show that one ticket won a tidy 2 million. Other people won money too, but they didn’t win much: Just under 4 percent of tickets — fewer than one in 25 — produced any winnings at all. And for 78 percent of those winning tickets, the prize was only 4. If you won one of those little prizes and had bought two tickets, you broke even for the day. For more than 96 percent of tickets, though, you simply kissed your money goodbye. In short, if your goal was actually to win money, your chances would be much better at the blackjack table in a casino. How much are people losing at state-run lottery games? For some of us, it’s a paltry sum, 10 or 20 a year. And a handful of people win multimillion-dollar pots. But for the millions of regular lottery players, it’s a different story. It takes a while to figure this out. But using publicly available lottery and census data, I estimate, very roughly, that millions of adults, perhaps as many as 50 million, are swallowing net losses that average 1,000 a year. (I used lottery estimates suggesting that roughly 20 percent of all players account for about three-quarters of all sales, and proceeded from there. Mr. Mehta does an elaborate version of this on his blog.) That’s a lot of money for a lot of people, and over a lifetime it could make the difference between a comfortable retirement and utter penury. In fact, if you were to invest that money in a diversified mutual fund every year from the age of 20 until 65, and it returned 5 percent annually, you would have a nest egg of about 150,000. When you realize that households in the United States had only a median net worth of 68,828 in 2011, according to the Federal Reserve, it’s clear that this forsaken nest egg is a significant amount of money. (I calculated the nest egg for an individual; statistically speaking, the Fed says, a household typically includes 1.8 adults, so the comparable nest egg would be about 270,000.) These numbers don’t take into account the impact on poorer people, who truly cannot afford to forgo such sums of money. And they don’t include the effects of taxes, which subtract from winnings. Money spent to play the lottery has already been taxed, while winnings, which are still subject to tax, are worth less than their face value. I’m not a puritan. I have no problem with gambling as a form of entertainment. If anybody wants to spend money this way, fine. But few people run these numbers themselves or, really, are equipped to do so: A recent study suggests that most Americans are not really financially literate. I suspect that few people fully understand the trade-offs they are making. At a minimum, the government ought to be doing no harm to its citizens, yet it appears to be promoting and benefiting from activities that are surely harming the life prospects of many people. It’s true, lottery revenue may help the government finance education and other programs, many of them quite worthwhile. Yet policy levers could be used in other ways. Local and state governments could instead engage in aggressive and creative marketing schemes that would actually improve our odds of attaining a decent financial future.

Here is a goal: To get a folded piece of paper to stay together, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To get a folded piece of paper to stay together, the best course of action would depend on the specific purpose or intended outcome of the task. Two primary methods can help you achieve this goal: adhesive application and alternative folding techniques. Here is a detailed comparison of both methods, considering factors like ease of use, sturdiness, reusability, and aesthetics: 1. Adhesive Application In this method, you apply an adhesive substance to the paper to hold the folds together. The adhesives you might consider include: a. Glue: A wet adhesive that requires a few seconds to minutes before fully drying and bonding to the paper can be applied with a brush, applicator, or directly from a bottle. b. Double-sided tape: A dry adhesive, you can apply it to the paper precisely, providing a quick bond without waiting for the adhesive to dry. c. Glue stick: Similar to glue, but in a more solid form, a glue stick allows for more controlled application without the messiness of a liquid adhesive. d. Staples: Another option to keep the paper together. It requires a stapler and does not involve adhesive or drying time, but it may cause small punctures in the paper. Ease of Use: Glue, double-sided tape, and glue sticks are generally straightforward to use, although glue can be messy at times. Staples require a stapler and, although easy to use, can puncture the paper. Sturdiness: Double-sided tape and staples tend to provide the best sturdiness, while wet adhesive (glue) and glue sticks are more likely to come undone with rigorous use. Reusability: Papers bonded with adhesive can be separated but may result in tearing or damage. Staples are easily removable but leave puncture marks behind. Aesthetics: Depending on the type of adhesive and application technique, both glue and double-sided tape can produce barely noticeable seams. Staples may be more visually obvious and leave puncture marks. 2. Alternative Folding Techniques This method employs various folding techniques to keep the paper together without relying on adhesives. a. Origami: The art of folding paper into various shapes without adhesive or cutting. Origami techniques often result in intricately folded and interlocked papers that do not require adhesive to stay together. b. Interlocking Folds: By using inventive folding methods, you can create paper folds that interlock and hold without glue, tape, or staples. Examples include envelope-style folds or tucking one edge of the paper into another. Ease of Use: Origami and other alternative folding techniques can be more challenging than adhesive application and may require practice or tutorials. Sturdiness: Folds that interlock can be sturdy, but their overall resilience will depend on the quality of the fold and the type of paper used. Reusability: Using folding techniques allows for reusability, as you can easily unfold the paper and use it again without damage or residue. Aesthetics: Since no adhesive is used, there are no visible seams, and the result can be more aesthetically pleasing. In conclusion, both methods have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice between adhesive application and alternative folding techniques depends on factors like ease of use, sturdiness, reusability, and aesthetics. For a relatively simpler and more straightforward approach, adhesives such as glue or tape may be more suitable. However, for a more visually appealing and reusable solution, folding techniques such as origami or interlocking folds can be more appropriate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.  During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together.

The film was directed by Gene Kerrigan and produced by Ali Hewson, the wife of U2's singer Bono. Hypothesis: Bono is a singer.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Bono is a singer from the given context. The information provided specifically mentions that Black Wind, White Land was produced by Ali Hewson, who is identified as the wife of U2's singer Bono. This implies that Bono is a singer, specifically of the band U2. To provide further support for this hypothesis, Bono is a well-known Irish singer, songwriter, philanthropist, and activist. Born Paul David Hewson in Dublin, Ireland, Bono is the lead vocalist and primary lyricist for the globally popular rock band U2. Formed in 1976, U2 has become one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time, with numerous hit songs and albums to their credit. Bono is widely recognized not only for his powerful voice and heartfelt lyrics, but also for his passionate commitment to a variety of social, political, and humanitarian causes. He co-founded the advocacy organization DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) in 2002, which later evolved into the ONE Campaign, a nonprofit focused on alleviating global poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa. Bono has been extensively involved in numerous charitable efforts and occasions, leveraging his celebrity status to raise awareness and funds for important issues. Returning to the context provided, Ali Hewson, Bono's wife, served as the producer for the 1993 documentary film 'Black Wind, White Land' which explored the impacts of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the development of people in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The film's creation and its connection to the Chernobyl Children's Project International further exhibit the couple's commitment to social and humanitarian causes.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.  Which P.D. took a less efficient approach in fighting crime?  Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be argued that Greenville P.D. took a less efficient approach to fighting crime. While there are concerns about the high costs of technology and potential lack of familiarity with information technology, it is important to weigh these against the benefits of implementing modern tools such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. These tools can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a police department in identifying and apprehending criminals.
