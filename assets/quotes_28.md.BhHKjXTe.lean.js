But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence. Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux (William Forsythe), a private detective, on the night his wife was killed to find out how he...

Five lead tablets buried in the grave of a young Greek woman about 2,400 years ago bear curses against four tavern-keepers in Athens, LiveScience reports. Apparently, burying the tablets was thought to put the curses closer to gods who could fulfill them. \\"Cast your hate upon Phanagora and Demetrios and their tavern and their property and their possessions,\\" reads one, against a husband-and-wife pair of tavern owners. The curse-writer then threatens to put Demetrios \\"in such a bind ... as strong as possible,\\" and \\"smite down a kynotos on [your] tongue.\\" Now Jessica Lamont, who teaches at John Hopkins University, has written about the 2003 find in an academic journal—and casts light on the phrase \\"kynotos on [your] tongue.\\" Meaning \\"dog's ear,\\" the kynotos was used in gambling as \\"the name for the lowest possible throw of dice,\\" says Lamont. \\"By striking Demetrios' tongue with this condemningly unlucky roll, the curse reveals that local taverns were not just sociable watering holes, but venues ripe for gambling and other unsavory activities in Classical Athens.\\" Lamont says someone \\"in the world of the tavern\\" may have hired a professional curse-writer to place the tablets—which are pierced by an iron nail—into the grave so that \\"chthonic\\" (or underworld) gods would act on them. A 1,700-year-old lead curse tablet found in a Roman mansion in Jerusalem is no less ominous: \\"I strike and strike down and nail down the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the procrastination, the opposition of [curse target] Iennys,\\" it reads, per a 2013 article in Discovery.","output":"Once upon a time, about 2,400 years ago in Athens, there was a young Greek woman who was buried with five special tablets. These tablets had curses written on them for four people who owned taverns. People believed that if they put the tablets in a grave, it would bring the curses closer to the gods who could make the bad things happen. One of the curses said something like, \\"Hey gods, make Phanagora and Demetrios, who own a tavern, have really bad luck and lots of trouble.\\" And then it asked the gods to make Demetrios feel really stuck and have a \\"dog's ear\\" on his tongue. A \\"dog's ear\\" was a term used in a dice game to mean the worst score ever. So, this curse was asking for bad luck and trouble for the tavern owners. A smart teacher named Jessica Lamont from John Hopkins University studied these tablet curses. She thinks that someone in the world of taverns hired a person who writes curses to create these tablets and put them in the grave with the young woman. They hoped that the powerful gods from the underworld would make the curses come true. A long time ago, even around 1,700 years ago, people found another curse tablet in a big house in Jerusalem. That curse was very strong too, saying, \\"I will make it so you can't talk, see, or do anything against me, Iennys.\\" So, people from a long, long time ago used to put powerful curses in graves, hoping that the gods would make bad things happen to the people they were angry with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so. In the USA everything is different. The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice. A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. But the film has a sequel. Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. This Public Attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. One day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses. Sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" (Declaration of Independence) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. Only God can take the life of a person away. The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. Even if we do not evoke God, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance.

Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama, speaking at his summit on countering violent extremism Wednesday, sought to strike a balance between appealing for more acceptance of Muslim-Americans while emphasizing the need to remain vigilant against radicals who could turn violent.      \\"We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam,\\" Obama said during his remarks, adding later that Muslim leaders \\"need to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam.\\"      Obama went to lengths before the summit began to avoid linking extremism to the Muslim faith; his intent, aides say, was to avoid giving credence to the ideologies of Islamic State or al Qaeda terrorists.      On Wednesday he sought to explain his wording, declaring al Qaeda and ISIS \\"desperate for legitimacy.\\"      \\"They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam,\\" he said. \\"We must never accept the premise that they put forward because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders. They are terrorists.\\"      Obama called for resilience in the face of terrorist threats and pointed to efforts in U.S. cities where Muslim communities and law enforcement are making strides in addressing the root causes of violent extremism.      \\"We all know there is no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist. There is no way to predict who will become radicalized,\\" he said. \\"We are here at this summit because of the urgent threat from groups like al Qaeda and ISIL and this week, we are focused on prevention.\\"      During Wednesday's session, the White House highlighted pilot programs in three metropolitan areas -- Boston, Los Angeles, and the Twin Cities -- where law enforcement and Muslim-American groups are trying to join forces to counter violent extremism.      Officials say they hope to replicate those programs in other places around the country with populations that could be prone to radicalization.      \\"This is really a moment to rededicate ourselves to efforts that really reach out to communities, and build that confidence that they need to have so that they feel comfortable working with authorities, both to prevent radicalization and also, when necessary, to intervene,\\" said one senior administration official.      That strategy has drawn criticism from civil rights organizations, who say the government risks alienating Muslim communities by partnering with religious and cultural organizations to identify potential extremists.      \\"From conceptualization to implementation, the CVE strategy raises significant constitutional and privacy concerns. It is not based on empirical evidence of effectiveness. It threatens to do more harm than good,\\" said Hina Shamsi, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project.      Officials attending the White House summit downplayed those fears, arguing the pilot programs established across the country were providing needed outreach to communities, and weren't spying on them.      \\"This has nothing to do with intelligence, it has nothing to do with surveillance, this is about developing healthier, resilient communities,\\" said Michael Downing, the Deputy Chief and commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's counterterrorism and special operations bureau.      He also pointed to the case in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Muslim Americans were the victims in a high profile murder case. The outcry from Muslim American groups led to a mass prayer outside the White House last week.      \\"We do not yet know why three young people, who were Muslim Americans, were brutally killed in Chapel Hill, N.C. But we know that many Muslim Americans across our country are worried and afraid,\\" Obama wrote in the op-ed. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Obama said Thursday he doesn't use terms like Islamic extremism because to do so would promote the false idea that the West is at war with Islam, thereby helping extremists recruit more terrorists.

Obama also said military force alone will not defeat terrorism, and the nation must work with local communities to reduce the influence of those who advocate violent extremism.      \\"They are not religious leaders,\\" Obama said. \\"They are terrorists.\\"      He also said: \\"We are not at war with Islam — we are at war with people who have perverted Islam.\\"      The summit — in which officials from cities in the United States and across the globe discussed their attempts to dissuade young people from embracing hateful ideologies — takes place as conservatives criticize Obama for avoiding the term \\"Islamic extremism.\\"      In his summit remarks, Obama cited the \\"fair amount of debate in the press and among pundits\\" about the words that used should be used to \\"describe and frame this challenge\\" of violent extremism.      Groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda \\"try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam,\\" Obama said, but \\"we must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie.\\"      Obama also said Muslim communities have responsibilities to confront the abuse of religion.      \\"Of course, the terrorists do not speak for a billion Muslims who reject their ideology,\\" Obama said. \\"They no more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name of God, represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism.\\"      In fighting extremism, Obama said the United States and allies must also address the economic and political \\"grievances\\" that often fuel violent ideology. Governments must work to help provide economic opportunity, education, democracy, and the rule of law to their citizens, he said.      The \\"best partners\\" for these efforts are local communities, Obama said. Family members, schools, churches and mosques, and law enforcement officials can help dissuade young people from falling for the \\"false promises of extremism.\\"      That said, Obama warned that \\"engagement with communities can't be a cover for surveillance,\\" and governments should deal with vulnerable people \\"through the prism of law enforcement.\\"      The nation must stay true to its heritage of tolerance and diversity and not target specific religious groups.      \\"It will take time,\\" he said. \\"This is a generational challenge,\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1A6Zl2R ||||| A recent news bulletin announced that police in Nova Scotia broke up a plot by two men who aimed to carry out mass murder at a shopping mall and then commit suicide.      Here is what the Associated Press said about the plot in its second paragraph:      “Police and other officials said it was not related to Islamic terrorism.”      Whew, that’s a relief. And a surprise.      If you shared my instant reactions, you also are wondering what the hell is going on with the Obama administration. When the liberal Associated Press feels the need to address readers’ assumptions about Islam and terrorism, we have a reached a tipping point.      Make that a worldwide tipping point. With the pope and Cardinal Timothy Dolan joining Jewish leaders and growing numbers of Muslim officials in Arab lands speaking honestly about the horrors perpetrated under Islam’s name, that leaves President Obama as the odd man out.      Not every Muslim is a terrorist. But almost all terrorists are Muslims. Those two statements are both accurate, as even Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi tacitly conceded when he scolded Islamic clerics for failing to halt the spread of jihadists. But inconvenient truths don’t matter to Obama.      The president’s ideological blinkers will be on vivid display this week, with 60 countries invited to a White House summit on extremism. But aides made clear there would be no change in the willful ignorance.      “We are not treating these people as part of a religion. We’re treating them as terrorists,” an official told reporters.      This is nuts. Although the Islamic State, al Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Taliban cite Islam as the basis of their death cults, Obama argues that their acts are contrary to Islam, and therefore, refuses to associate them with Islam.      Thankfully, Christian leaders finally realize they cannot count on the president and must themselves sound the alarm about what is happening in Muslim countries. The beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya was the latest outrage linked to a genocidal religious cleansing.      As the pope and Dolan made clear, the victims were killed because of their faith, with the Islamic butchers calling them “people of the cross” and “crusaders.”      The fact that Jews are singled out for their religion is hardly in doubt — except at the White House. After Obama foolishly used the word “randomly” to describe the slaughter of four Jews in a Paris kosher deli, aides scrambled to defend him. They soon gave up, conceding what French authorities said all along — the slaughter was an anti-Semitic attack by a follower of the Islamic State.      Obama’s hesitation to admit the obvious fact about the victims echoes the refusal to properly call Islamic terrorists what they are.      At the same time, he has no problem standing up for Islam when he thinks its adherents are wronged. Although police have not concluded that the murder of three Muslims in North Carolina had anything to do with religion — the killer confessed and denied religion was an issue — the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation and Obama issued a statement suggesting the murders were hate crimes.      “No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,” he said.      Remember, too, that he recently singled out the Crusades to warn Christians about getting on their “high horse” over Muslim killers.      If the issue were only semantics, it would be minor in the grand scheme. But the refusal to concede that Islamic terrorists are, in fact, Islamic leads to flawed understandings of the problem and missed chances for potential solutions.      One example of the garbage-in, garbage-out dynamic is the ridiculous assertion by a State Department official that jobs programs are part of the answer.      “We cannot win this war by killing them,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said on MSNBC, arguing that America should “help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.”      The rot of denial runs deep, and starts at the top.      It’s a rotten way to run a government      There he goes again.      Gov. Andrew Cuomo is still sending mixed messages about his commitment to cleaning up Albany, saying on TV that “You’ve always had and you probably always will have some level of corruption.’’      Technically speaking, he’s right. But the context — a parade of government perps, including the arrest of former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — makes Cuomo sound too defensive and casts doubt on his latest promise to do something about the rotten apples.      Earlier this month, he proposed ethics demands that he said the Legislature must pass before he would sign a budget. He conceded then that “we have not yet proven . . . that Albany writ large can be trusted.”      He was right then, and wrong now. His suggestion that the crime wave is nothing extraordinary recalls Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s warning about “defining deviancy down.” As the late senator noted, rot becomes permanent when people accept the abnormal as normal and give up trying to fix it.      Cuomo also said in the NY1 interview that there are no plans to hang the customary portrait of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer because he resigned in a prostitution scandal.      The old Soviet system of erasing out-of-favor pols from history comes to mind. Sure, Spitzer was a disgrace, but he belongs on Albany’s wall of governors. If nothing else, his face will be a daily reminder of what happens when politicians think they are above the law.      Let Client No. 9 take his place. And let his successors take their cue from his fall.      A ‘law’ unto Dem selves      In my next life, I want to come back as a progressive. That way, I’ll know everything for certain.      After a federal judge put a temporary halt to President Obama’s immigration orders, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his Mini-Me, Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, declared the judge wrong on the law.      Neither is a lawyer, but that didn’t stop them. The mayor called the president’s actions “lawful” and said he was confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal.      Mark-Viverito chimed in to say Obama’s “plan is constitutional and necessary.”      Inadvertently, the would-be tyrants point up a big potential for savings. With progressives in power, we don’t need judges, courts, checks and balances. We could just turn back the clock to the 18th century and go for a monarchy. Who needs elections?      Times hooey on St. Louie      The New York Times reports that murders in St. Louis increased 33 percent last year, to 159 in a city of 318,000 people. By comparison, New York had 328 murders in a city of 8.4 million.      The Times headline said, “Rise in Murders has St. Louis Debating Why.”      Really? Perhaps murder is out of control because St. Louis has a political culture that reflexively attacks cops for doing their jobs, brands them as racists and orders them to ignore looters and arsonists.

He trained his army strictly until it was very strong. Three years later, he led his army against the State of Yue and caught its king Gou Jian, who was taken to the State of Wu. Gou Jian was put into a small black stone house which was full of terrible smell and was made to raise  horses. Gou worked hard and tried to keep himself quiet, but he never forgot his pain. Many years later, he was set free. Gou secretly trained his army after he went back to his own state.

So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger. There are many misconceptions  surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do. You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes. The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents  and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives. Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt  their head forwards and ask the person to pinch  the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth. You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online. Remember: anyone can save a life Question: The most important point to save a person's life is to ensure   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"his smooth breath\\"?","output":"No, the answer is not \\"his smooth breath.\\" While ensuring that someone can breathe is certainly crucial in many emergency situations, your statement simplifies the matter too much. The most important point to save someone's life varies considerably depending on the nature of their medical emergency.  For instance, if someone is choking or their airway is blocked, then yes, clearing the airway is the immediate priority. This is due to the fact that the lack of oxygen can cause significant brain damage or death in a matter of minutes. However, if someone has suffered a severe cut or wound, then making sure they can breathe smoothly is not the immediate priority. In this case, applying pressure to the wound to stop or slow the bleeding should be the initial focus. If too much blood is lost, it can lead to a state of shock, which can be life-threatening.  Another common misconception is treating a burn with butter or cream. As the article points out, the correct action is to cool the burn under cold running water to prevent further damage and alleviate pain. Similarly, for nosebleeds, the correct thing to do is to advise the person to tilt their head forwards and pinch their nose, contrary to the misconception of leaning the head back. It's also important to remember that you don't necessarily need lots of training to perform first aid, and that anyone can help save a life. Of course, formal training can be helpful, but much can be learned from reading a book, taking a brief online course, or even watching videos. In a situation where professional medical help is not immediately available, basic first aid knowledge coupled with common sense can potentially save someone's life. So, while ensuring a person's smooth breath is important in certain circumstances, it is not the single, always applicable answer to saving a person's life. It's necessary to assess the situation at hand, apply the correct first aid measures, and seek professional medical help as quickly as possible. So, in this context, your answer \\"his smooth breath\\" is overly simplistic and not always applicable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is?","output":"The make of car used as the platform for the time machine in the Back to the Future franchise is the DeLorean DMC-12. The DeLorean Motor Company, founded by John DeLorean, produced this unique sports car. Known simply as the \\"DeLorean,\\" the DMC-12 was the only model ever produced by the company before it went bankrupt in 1982. The car featured distinct gull-wing doors, a brushed stainless-steel body, and a rear-mounted engine. It was manufactured between 1981 and 1983, with only around 9,000 units produced. The DeLorean became iconic and garnered significant attention after its appearance in the Back to the Future films, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg. The first movie in the trilogy was released in July 1985, starring Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as the eccentric inventor Dr. Emmett \\"Doc\\" Brown. The DeLorean was transformed into a time machine by Doc Brown, who retrofitted the vehicle with a \\"flux capacitor\\" and later, \\"Mr. Fusion,\\" which allowed for time travel when the car reached the speed of 88 miles per hour. The DMC-12 became an integral part of the story throughout the Back to the Future trilogy, with Marty and Doc Brown traveling to various points in time, including 1955, 2015, and 1885. The DeLorean went through several modifications in each film, such as hover capabilities in \\"Back to the Future Part II\\" and a primitive 19th-century steam engine replacement in \\"Back to the Future Part III.\\" Although the DeLorean Motor Company ceased operating in 1982, the DeLorean DMC-12's cinematic role ensured its place in pop culture history. Today, the car remains a highly sought-after collector's item, particularly among fans of the Back to the Future franchise. Several restoration initiatives and companies now exist, dedicated to servicing and supplying parts for DeLorean owners around the world. Additionally, the vehicle's unique design and association with time travel have made it a mainstay in discussions of 1980s nostalgia and entertainment history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the actual person who began composing songs in a distinctive, original style on his return to England in 1918?  Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations.

Using one ball of at a time, lightly dust your dough with flour. Stretch gradually on a flat, floured surface until it is about as big as your pizza stone (typically about 14”). A cutting board, a flat baking sheet, or a peel will work for your surface. A peel is a wide flat tool for your pizza. The front edge is typically tapered so that your pizza can slide easily on and off of it. Once your dough is stretched to the desired size, spread your sauce and add your cheese. Top with the vegetables, meats, and seasonings of your choice. This will be much easier if you’ve properly floured your flat surface.

Lightly dust a ball of dough with flour and gradually stretch it on a floured flat surface, such as a cutting board or a peel, until it reaches the size of your pizza stone (usually 14 inches). Spread sauce, cheese, and your choice of toppings over the dough. Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone using your flat surface, using a jerking motion if needed. Bake for 4-6 minutes, watching closely for browning crust. Remove the pizza with your flat surface, let it rest for a few minutes to avoid burns, and then enjoy your delicious, crispy pizza."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -14 = 5*r + 2*r for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. 5*r and 2*r are like terms because they both have the variable r. Add them together to simplify the equation: -14 = (5*r + 2*r) -14 = 7*r Step 2: Solve for r. Now, we need to isolate the variable r. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 7: -14 = 7*r -14/7 = (7*r)/7 -2 = r The value of r is -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: Seeing the desired results of doing housework left her what? Options: - smiley - house clean - getting good grades - feeling satisfied - boredom  Explain why a human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question above due to the psychological and emotional impact housework has on an individual. Let us break down each option and analyze why \\"feeling satisfied\\" is the most suitable choice: 1. Smiley: Although seeing the desired results of housework might make the person smile, this option does not effectively convey the emotional state or the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing housework. Smiling is just an expression or action and does not necessarily imply satisfaction. 2. House clean: This option merely states a fact about housework; it is true that doing housework results in a clean house. However, it doesn't tell us anything about how the person feels after completing the housework, nor does it answer the question of how housework affects the individual emotionally. 3. Getting good grades: This option seems unrelated to the context of housework. Good grades are typically associated with an academic setting, and there is no direct correlation between housework and academic performance. 4. Feeling satisfied: This option aligns with how people can experience a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment after completing tasks in general, including housework. Satisfactory results from housework can provide a sense of control, orderliness, and pride in one's living environment. Additionally, satisfaction might arise from realizing that the effort invested in housework has directly improved the cleanliness and organization of the living space, creating a more comfortable and pleasing environment for oneself and others. 5. Boredom: This option is not a suitable answer because the question explicitly states that the person is seeing the \\"desired results\\" of housework, implying that the task had a positive outcome. Boredom doesn't fit within this context, as it typically results from a lack of interest or engagement in an activity. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question because it best captures the emotional response and sense of accomplishment that people often experience when they have successfully completed housework. This satisfaction stems from the improved cleanliness, orderliness, and comfort of their living environment, as well as the pride they take in their ability to maintain and care for their home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him.

It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - An academician is a full member of an artistic, literary, or scientific academy.

Here is a question about this article: Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.

Fat chance you say? Exactly.      Nearly a third of Mexican adults are obese, a recent United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization report says, topping even the United States, which comes in a close second at 31.8%.      The United States has long been a fixture atop the chubby list.      The culprit? High-calorie, low-cost, processed foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle as Mexican incomes rise and more people move into metropolitan areas.      The danger, according to the World Health Organization, is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, degenerative joint diseases and some cancers.

Q: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: Who is Editor Frank? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Editor Frank, mentioned in the passage, is not directly explained or introduced, and it is possible that the name has been incorrectly mentioned or that there is a potential typo. The context in which the name \\"Editor Frank\\" appears refers to \\"Editor Furtok\\", which could potentially be the correct name. Editor Furtok is a parent of one of the children who got accepted into the Part-time Evening Elementary School (PEES), specifically the group B2/platform PC. When a frustrated father whose child was not accepted into the school accused the school of only accepting VIP brats, Editor Furtok was offended and physically assaulted the disappointed father as a reaction. In the given information, it is not detailed on whether Editor Furtok is named Frank or if he holds a position at a newspaper, magazine, or any other publication. However, the fact that he is referred to as an \\"editor\\" suggests that he might be involved in that professional field. The PEES, as mentioned in the passage, is a school for children of wealthy families who spend their days playing computer games and need a school that operates during evening hours. Created by Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher and computer games fan, the school offers various classes focused on different gaming platforms. The institution was in high demand, resulting in a competitive and violent registration process. Parents were required to pass a joystick test and provide proof of income for their children to be admitted to the school. This uniquely tailored educational institution serves the needs of parents who seek peace and quiet while their children are preoccupied with computer games, making it a popular choice among affluent families. To sum up, Editor Frank might be an incorrect mention or a typo in the passage, and the relevant person could be Editor Furtok. He is a parent who successfully got his child into the PEES and is involved in an altercation with another parent during the admission process. There is no additional information provided about his professional background or his full name, but the title \\"editor\\" could indicate that he works in the publishing or media sector."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Nelson River flows into Playgreen Lake from Lake Winnipeg. 2. The river flows from two channels into Cross Lake. Now, let's analyze the differences: 1. In Sentence 1, the river flows from Playgreen Lake, while in Sentence 2, the river flows into Playgreen Lake from Lake Winnipeg. This implies that the river is originating from Lake Winnipeg in Sentence 2, whereas the source of the river is not clear in Sentence 1.  2. In Sentence 1, the river flows into Cross Lake before flowing from two channels to Winnipeg Lake. In Sentence 2, the river flows from two channels into Cross Lake after coming from Lake Winnipeg.

Given the following context:  Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.  answer the following question:  What did the Tibetans capture in 678?

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: You do not have to express emotions with every person you talk with. When you are first expressing your emotions, you may feel silly or vulnerable, so you must choose friends and family that you trust to withhold judgments, and accept that you are striving to make changes. When you are conversing with others, exaggerate your facial expressions, hand gestures, and emotional responses. If you go over the top with your emotions, you can learn to rein in your emotional response over time.  You may feel silly being over the top about your emotions, but if you choose the right people to do this with, it will not matter, and will be of ultimate benefit to you. Be cautions when being overly expressive. Ensure you think about your emotions and actions before you act on them. If you are overly emotive about being angry, you might come across as hostile or dangerous. So emote with caution! Emotions are felt stronger when a behavior is attached to them, even if the behavior is not a natural response. You can ‘fake’ cry when you know you feel sad. This will elevate and intensify your emotional sadness, and may lead to real crying or, at least, a greater show of emotion. Emotions contain certain impulses (fear elicits the fight or flight response, anger elicits retaliation) that you have no control over. When you have these impulses, do not fight against them; instead amplify them so they show outwardly. Using physical contact can be helpful in expressing your emotions. Physical touch can impart emotion in a way our facial expressions or verbal tone cannot. Recent scientific studies have shown that humans have an innate ability to decipher emotions through physical touch alone.  When someone makes you happy, gently place you hand on their shoulder. When you feel disgust, squeeze someone’s arm. Physical touch is not welcomed by everyone, and if done incorrectly, may not be well received. Pick up on nonverbal cues from others about their acceptance of physical touch, and do it moderation. Not every situation calls for emotion, such as a work meeting, while others, such as talking with your significant other, require a more heightened emotive response. Judge each situation independently to decide the level of emotion you should show.","output":"Sometimes, it's hard to show our feelings when we talk to people. It's important to choose special friends and family who make us feel safe to share our emotions with. Try using your face and hands to show more feelings, but be careful not to be too much. Also, sometimes touching someone gently can help show your feelings, but not everyone likes that. Remember, some places are not the best to show a lot of emotions, like at work. Always think about the right moment and people to share your feelings with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Romans\\" correctly answer the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Romans\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\" According to the paragraph, around 2000 B.C., Celtic tribes from eastern Europe were settling in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Burgundy, while migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south.

What is the final step of the following process: -  The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of this process is the restoration of blood sugar levels back to normal. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: When there's a drop in blood sugar concentration in the body, this is typically due to factors like prolonged periods of fasting, heavy exercise, or an insulin overshoot in the management of diabetes. This decrease is detected by alpha cells in the pancreas, which then secrete the hormone glucagon as a response. Glucagon acts on hepatic (liver) cells. Once it reaches these cells, it initiates a process known as glycogenolysis. This process involves the conversion of stored glycogen, a multi-branched polysaccharide of glucose, into glucose molecules. The liver, which can store considerable amounts of this glycogen, begins to break it down into glucose, thereby increasing glucose levels in the blood. The glucose that is produced by the liver in response to glucagon is then released into the bloodstream. This introduction of glucose into the blood helps restore the blood glucose levels back to their normal range (homeostasis). It is a critical action as the brain and other organs primarily use glucose for their energy requirements. Regulated by negative feedback, this glucagon-induced increase in blood glucose levels eventually signals the pancreatic alpha cells to stop releasing glucagon, preventing the glucose concentration from getting too high. Hence, the final step includes the re-stabilization of blood sugar levels to a normal range, which the body systems can effectively utilize for energy production. This process exemplifies the body's critical balance and regulatory mechanism to maintain the right amount of blood sugar, which is crucial for proper body functioning. The key here is the elaborate coordination between the pancreas, the liver, and the amount of sugar in your blood to ensure that your body maintains homeostasis. Without this intricate balance, one may experience detrimental health effects associated with blood sugar levels that are either too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Real Madrid, in Search of Perfection, Axes Ancelotti Real Madrid fired manager Carlo Ancelotti on Monday, making him the 12th coaching casualty since 2003 at one of the most trigger-happy clubs in Europe. Ancelotti paid the price for a spring without a major title, despite delivering Real’s coveted 10th European cup just a year ago. Real president Florentino Perez made the announcement at a news conference in Madrid on Monday evening. “It was not an easy decision but it is time to reinvigorate the team to conquer new titles,” he said in Spanish. He added that the club’s board would announce a replacement next week. Real finished its La Liga campaign as runners-up to Barcelona over the weekend, while its Champions League challenge fell apart in the semifinals against Juventus this month. Its failure in the domestic cup also helped eclipse a run of 22 straight victories for Real Madrid over the winter. In an interview published in his native Italy earlier in the day, Ancelotti, 55, said that he was due to have back surgery. Though he would have liked another year, he said that he would have required some time off to recover anyway. Ancelotti succeeded Jose Mourinho at Madrid in the summer of 2013 as the club sought to end a Champions League dry spell that had dragged on for more than a decade. He delivered the elusive 10th title, the so-called Decima, last spring in Lisbon. Real defeated crosstown rival Atlético Madrid in extra time of a nerve-shredding final. In 2014, Real also beat Barcelona in the final of the Copa del Rey, Spain’s domestic cup. But big results in the league were harder to come by. Ancelotti lost three of his four Clasicos in La Liga play. “He is part of our history because he was the coach with whom we have won La Decima,” Perez said. “But as we all know, Real Madrid’s standard is high.” Reports in Spain have mentioned former Liverpool and Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez as a potential successor. Benitez, who won two league titles in his native Spain with Valencia in the early 2000s, has spent the past two seasons in charge of Napoli in Italy’s Serie A. On Monday, Perez dropped the biggest hint yet that the club was lining him up. “It would be very good,” he said, “if the new coach spoke Castillian.” For the latest sports coverage, follow @WSJSports Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Real Madrid has fired manager Carlo Ancelotti due to a season without a major title, despite winning the 10th European Cup last year; the club plans to announce a replacement next week in an attempt to reinvigorate the team for future successes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mumtaz Mahal (Urdu: mumtz mHal ), ([mum'ta:z me'hel]; meaning \\"the Exalted One of the palace\\"; Arjumand Banu; 27 April 1593 - 17 June 1631) was Empress consort of the Mughal Empire from 19 January 1628 to 17 June 1631 as the chief consort of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The UNESCO World Heritage Site Taj Mahal in Agra, often cited as one of the Wonders of the World, was commissioned to act as her final resting place. Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility. Upon his accession to the throne in 1628, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of 'Malika-i-Jahan' (\\"Queen of the World\\") and 'Malika-uz-Zamani' (\\"Queen of the Age\\"). Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given regular monthly allowance for her gastos (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal under Shah Jahan.  Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state and she served as his close confidante and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land -- his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign.  A great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation which can be connected to her patronage. Entity:","output":"The text is about Mumtaz Mahal, who was the Empress consort of the Mughal Empire and the chief consort of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. She is best known as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, which was built as her final resting place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Li Zicheng and Tibetans were fought against by the Monguors, who supported the Ming, and when the Qing fought against Li's forces after 1644 they joined the Qing side. Late in 1646, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin  revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou . He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong . Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the fallen Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion, and were not aiming to create an Islamic state. To pacify the rebels, the Qing government quickly despatched Meng Qiaofang , governor of Shaanxi, a former Ming official who had surrendered to the Qing in 1631. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by the Muslim Chagatid Kumul Khanate and the Turfan Khanate and after their defeat, Kumul submitted to the Qing. Another Muslim rebel, Ma Shouying, was allied to Li Zicheng and the Shun dynasty. Question: Who occupied a number of towns in Gansu along with Milayin? Answer:","output":"Along with Milayin, another Muslim leader named Ding Guodong occupied a number of towns in Gansu.

Despite their efforts, both Milayin and Ding Guodong were eventually captured and killed in 1648, with the rebellion being crushed by 1650."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write a text based on this summary: depleted uranium threatens balkan cancer epidemic Text:","output":"Title: Alarming Concerns Rise as Depleted Uranium Threatens a Cancer Epidemic in the Balkans Region Introduction Depleted uranium, a toxic waste product from nuclear power plants, is an alarming cause for concern as it threatens to fuel a cancer epidemic in the Balkans region. Known for its use as a radioactive material in the production of munitions and armor-piercing weaponry, depleted uranium has the potential to cause severe environmental and health hazards in areas where it has been used. I. The Growing Prevalence of Depleted Uranium in the Balkans A. Military Conflicts The use of depleted uranium in military conflicts in the Balkans region, such as the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, has significantly contributed to the dispersion of this toxic material. The radioactive waste generated in these confrontations has led to an increase in the number of contaminated sites throughout the Balkans, posing a dire threat to public health and the environment. B. Environmental Impact Depleted uranium can easily seep into soil and groundwater, contaminating essential resources for human and animal life. The pollution caused by discharged toxic materials and the decay of weapons systems results in the bioaccumulation of radioactive substances in local ecosystems. As organisms consume contaminated resources, larger predators and humans are ultimately affected, leading to severe health problems in both humans and wildlife. II. Health Dangers of Depleted Uranium Exposure A. Elevated Cancer Rates Long-term exposure to depleted uranium has been linked to a sharp increase in cancer rates among affected populations. Radioactive materials released from munitions and armor casings can infiltrate air, water, and soil, leading to the ingestion of hazardous substances by unsuspecting individuals. The high levels of radiation can cause DNA mutations, leading to the development of malignant tumors. B. Pregnant Women and Children Most vulnerable to the health risks posed by depleted uranium are pregnant women and children, as both groups are more prone to experiencing harmful effects from radiation exposure. In particular, unborn children exposed to elevated levels of radiation may face an increased risk of developing congenital defects, neurological problems, and other serious health complications. III. Current Measures and Efforts to Address the Situation A. Clean Up and Remediation Efforts In response to the threats posed by depleted uranium, international organizations and local governments are taking on the responsibility of clearing contaminated sites and implementing strategies for the safe disposal of material waste. These efforts play a crucial role in mitigating further contamination in the region, but challenges remain in terms of funding and stakeholder involvement. B. Public Awareness and Education Campaigns Public awareness and educational campaigns are essential for enabling affected communities to understand the risks associated with depleted uranium exposure. By providing vital information and resources, these organizations empower individuals to take informed action in safeguarding themselves and their families from potential health threats. IV. Conclusion: The Need for Concerted Action and Global Cooperation The perils of depleted uranium in the Balkans region underscore the necessity for robust global cooperation in order to successfully combat this looming cancer epidemic. It is imperative for countries to collaborate in the development and enforcement of effective measures, including the prohibition of manufacturing and using depleted uranium weapons. By acknowledging and confronting this escalating public health hazard, global leaders can effectively safeguard future generations and protect the environment from the detrimental effects of depleted uranium contamination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - A papal bull is a particular type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it.  - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital.  - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137  4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church .  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.   - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents.  - Mamluk (Arabic: \\"mamlk\\" (singular), \\"mamlk\\" (plural), meaning \\"property\\" , also transliterated as \\"mamlouk\\", \\"mamluq\\", \\"mamluke\\", \\"mameluk\\", \\"mameluke\\", \\"mamaluke\\" or \\"marmeluke\\") is an Arabic designation for slaves. The term is most commonly used to refer to Muslim slave soldiers and Muslim rulers of slave origin.  - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  - A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person. Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.    What is the relationship between 'order of saint lazarus' and 'christianity'?","output":"The relationship between the Order of Saint Lazarus and Christianity lies in their shared religious origins and the role the order played in protecting and supporting the Christian faith. The Order of Saint Lazarus was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem, then part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Crusader state established during the First Crusade. The order's original purpose was the care of those afflicted with leprosy and other diseases, reflecting the Christian values of charity and compassion. The Order was named after its patron saint, Lazarus, who, according to Christian belief, was raised from the dead by Jesus Christ. Over time, the Order of Saint Lazarus evolved into both a hospitaller and military order, committed to defending Christian lands and territories from external threats, particularly during the Crusades, when Christian forces sought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim control. The Order of Saint Lazarus played a significant role in defending the Christian faith and assisting fellow Christian military orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, during these religious conflicts. The Order of Saint Lazarus maintained a strong connection with the Roman Catholic Church, adhering to its doctrines and receiving canonical recognition as a military and hospitaller order from Pope Alexander IV in a papal bull in 1255. Throughout its existence, the order was closely tied to Christianity, as its members were religiously motivated to protect and serve the faith, as well as provide care to those in need. In summary, the relationship between the Order of Saint Lazarus and Christianity is based on their shared religious origins, the order's commitment to protecting and promoting the Christian faith, and its members' adherence to the doctrines, values, and guidance of the Roman Catholic Church. The Order of Saint Lazarus exemplifies the fusion of religious faith and military action that characterized much of the medieval era and the Crusades in particular, all in the name of Christianity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ever since Steven Levitt published “Freak-onomics,” in 2005, books explaining everyday pheno-mena in economic terms have been flying off the bestseller shelves and – proving that economists respond rationally to incentives – inspiring imitators. Tim Harford struck early with his celebrated “The Undercover Economist,” and he has now followed up with “The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World,” which should do well for Harford’s personal economy, too. But why, exactly, are books like this so popular? And do they really deliver useful insights? At one level, the appeal is obvious: The world is a complex place, and any approach that lets us lay down some sort of a grid that makes sense of all that confusion seems pretty good. People are often ready to accept approaches that are fairly obviously bogus (astrology? aura readings?), so a simplifying and clarifying approach that has academic respectability is even more appealing. It helps even more that this approach often works. Lots of things that are confusing turn out to make sense in a reliable way when you apply economic reasoning. The laws of supply and demand matter; things seldom turn out to be worth more (or less) than the discounted present value of their future revenues; and people generally put out more effort for their own behalf than they do for the benefit of others. Systems structured around these truths tend to succeed, while systems that deny them tend to fail. Even better, it’s fun. Much that seems on the surface inexplicable turns out to make perfect logical sense once you understand the incentives and how people respond to them. And that’s the approach of Harford’s latest work. Though fun, it’s not Pollyannaish. Harford makes clear that people, acting rationally as individuals, can nonetheless act in ways that, from the standpoint of society, seem irrational and destructive. Thus, understanding the underlying rationales is the key to understanding and addressing the problems. At any rate, most of the fun in Harwood’s book is found in the specific topics he addresses, and the way he reveals – much like a magician or a mystery author – the solution to the questions he presents. Why do single women outnumber single men in Manhattan? Because women, seeking men who make a lot of money, converge on places that are rich in men who make a lot of money. Then those women complain that there aren’t enough good men. “Manhattan’s women may constantly grumble about the lack of marriageable men in the city, but it is their rational choice not to relocate to Alaska,” he writes. But it turns out that the imbalance causes more problems than sheer scarcity. Eligible males benefit from competition among eligible females, allowing them to commit later, expect sex earlier and so on, and even a slight imbalance in the gender ratio produces a big imbalance in dating power, since women don’t want to be left empty-handed at the end. Nor is this limited to the wealthy, as Harford observes a similar pattern in poor black neighborhoods where a higher percentage of men are in prison or otherwise poor marriage prospects, drastically strengthening the bargaining position of those who remain. (Of course, it’s a two-edged sword: When I was a single lawyer at a big Wall Street firm, I felt that many women saw me as a walking paycheck, more interested in my prospects than my personality, just as many women feel that some men are more interested in certain other attributes. I suppose that’s different for lawyers nowadays, with the much-richer hedge-fund guys around to play the walking-paycheck role.) On the other hand, while the dating market may favor men, Harford suggests that shifts toward easier divorce laws – generally thought to favor men by making it easier to leave a dutiful wife behind in favor of a mistress or future “trophy wife” – actually have benefited women. Formerly kept out of the workforce by the demands of raising a family, and the benefits that came from specialization, women – largely freed from housework by smaller family size and modern appliances – looked at things differently in light of easy divorce and readily available contraception. While promises that women could “have it all” may have been somewhat overstated, it doesn’t seem like hyperbole compared to what had come before. It was the threat of divorce that jumpstarted things, Harford argues: “Realizing that the economic unit might break up, at which point a woman who simply specialized in having children was in serious trouble, it became rational for a woman to maintain career options as divorce insurance. . . . Because divorce was conceivable, women preserved career options. But because women had career options, divorce became conceivable. It became less and less likely that a woman would become trapped in a miserable marriage out of pure economic necessity.” The result was a shift from the man’s world workplace of the 1960s and 1970s to a world in which the workplace in many ways favors women over men, as well as a decrease in domestic abuse in homes. There are downsides, of course – there are fewer unhappy marriages, but also more divorces. And there’s another downside that Harford doesn’t mention, but that goes with the theme of rational actors and societal downsides: The entry of women into high-powered careers seems to have led to more “assortative mating” where high-earning professional males, who if they married a coworker 50 years ago would have married a secretary or file clerk, now tend to marry other high-earners like themselves. That tends to cause the rich (or at least the upper middle class) to get richer and removes from the poor one major path of upward mobility; now the secretaries have a poorer shot at marrying the boss. Poor cities, on the other hand, face a different problem. As a first approximation, you might think that a city with a weak economy and plunging real estate prices might find those problems mitigated because the lower real estate prices would draw in new people. And you’d be right. But Harford notes that this can actually compound the problem. High-earning people would rather live in Manhattan, despite high rents, because that puts them in a better position to associate with (and perhaps assortatively mate with) other high-skill, high-earning people. The people who tend to move into the depressed neighborhoods of Detroit, on the other hand, usually move there because it’s cheap, meaning that they don’t have much money, and as a group tend to bring fewer skills and interests that might make those neighborhoods a better place. Worse yet, these tendencies tend to be self-reinforcing and long-lasting. Again, the better off tend to do better, and the poor tend to do worse – at least if “better off” means “well off enough to pay Manhattan rents.” On the other hand, high rents in Manhattan tend to be self-reinforcing and long-lasting, too. And this is because of the rational behavior of special interests, those who already own Manhattan real estate. Harford writes: “Back in 1970s, the price of a house anywhere in America – even an apartment in Manhattan – was not much more than the cost of building it.” But zoning regulations have driven those costs up in urban areas like Manhattan, to an estimated cost of nearly 10,000 per person per year, mostly as higher rents and mortgage payments. This is bad for Manhattan, but good for landlords and homeowners, who support regulation at the expense of renters. (Such restrictions are promoted as bringing environmental benefits, but Harford argues pretty persuasively that those environmental benefits are nonexistent, serving largely as a smokescreen for privilege.) There’s much more to Harford’s book – I haven’t even gotten to his explanation of why the increase in oral sex among teenagers is a sign of rational risk assessment rather than depravity – but these examples will have to do. So how well does Harford’s analysis hold up? Pretty well. At times, Harford can seem a bit facile – for every divorcee fulfilling herself in a high-powered corporate job, I suspect that there’s probably at least one divorced waitress in a truck stop who’d rather be home with her kids. But the benefit of books like “The Logic of Life” doesn’t come from the specific policy insights. The real benefit lies in exposing a large number of readers to the economic worldview, one in which people generally know what they want, and rationally try to obtain it, and in which human behavior isn’t easily changed by ham-handed government action and wishful thinking. This notion, together with its corollary – there is no free lunch – is something that our political classes tend to forget, or at least to want to ignore. In this election year, we should thank Harford for educating voters a bit more. Glenn Reynolds is the Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee, and runs instapundit.com The Rational Economics of an Irrational World Why do more women than men live in Manhattan? Studies of Internet dating have shown what we all suspect: that women look for high earners and men look for young, attractive women. It’s a carryover of evolutionary biology, when powerful men could protect a family better, and younger women could produce more offspring. Since a woman who earns more money isn’t important for men, unskilled men are more likely to move out of a city with rising rents. Unskilled women will stick around for the chance to land rich men. “In New York, there are 860,000 men between the ages of 20 and 34, but there are 910,000 women. Consciously or not, plenty of women seem to have decided they would rather compete for scarce, wealthy males than move where the males are poorer but more plentiful,” Harford writes. On the impact of the Pill There are many, but one is that it increased the number of women lawyers and doctors. Since women could delay having children for longer periods of time – but not give up sex – “that made it rational to invest in training for a career with a long prequalification period, such as law, medicine or dentistry. Female enrollment in law and medical school soared as the pill became available.” On the epidemic of teenage oral sex It doesn’t have to do with loosening morals or kids gone wrong. It’s that young people who would ordinarily be having sex have had the fear of AIDS drilled into them from puberty. “Regular sex is more costly than it used to be because of the spread of HIV/AIDS,” Harford writes. “The costs of oral sex are, quite simply, lower than the costs of regular sex.” Other economic studies show that where parental notification of abortion laws are passed, gonorrhea rates among teens drop. As unlikely as it sounds, apparently teens do think through having sex – particularly if the consequences are greater. On whether people are looking for “the one” Harford studied 2,000 speed dates, and noted that people’s standards depended on who showed up. “For example, men prefer women who are not overweight. You might think, then, that if on a particular evening twice as many overweight women as usual show up, it will be a night when fewer men propose a date. Not at all. The men propose a date just as frequently, so that when twice as many overweight women turn up, twice as many overweight women receive offers of a date.” While you would expect people to just give up and go home if they didn’t see anyone who fit their “type,” “instead, people respond to slim pickings by lowering their standards.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"\\"The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World\\" by Tim Harford is a book that uses economic principles to explain puzzling social phenomena and encourages readers to understand the world through an economic viewpoint, where people know what they want and try to obtain it rationally.

Help as much as you can. Question: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Which path will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate?  Hint: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).  Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] Answer:","output":"Path B will allow for more time for the pheromones to evaporate. Since path B is longer (150 meters) compared to path A (100 meters), it will take ants more time to travel down the path and back again, which gives more time for the pheromone trail to evaporate. As a result, the pheromone density will be lower on the longer path (path B) than on the shorter path (path A)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: Following their victory against the Panthers, the Bengals played another home game, this week, against the visiting Falcons.  In the first quarter, the Falcons drew first blood, as kicker Morten Andersen nailed a 42-yard field goal. The Bengals responded with a 1-yard TD run by running back Rudi Johnson. Atlanta cut the lead to one point, when Andersen kicked a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Cincinnati added to their lead with quarterback Carson Palmer's 12-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson.  The Falcons responded with quarterback Michael Vick's 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Alge Crumpler. Bengal kicker Shayne Graham converted a 51-yard field goal with&#160;:20 left before halftime. In the third quarter, Vick completed a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Jenkins. Graham would kick a 26-yard field goal for Cincinnati's only score of the quarter. Vick scored another touchdown, on an 8-yard pass to  fullback Justin Griffith. The extra point ended with a bobbled snap, and a failed two-point conversion.  In the fourth quarter, Andersen converted a 39-yard field goal. Palmer responded with a 55-yard touchdown to WR Chris Henry.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  Answer this question please: Which city experiences less energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Kansas City experiences less energy release due to rocks breaking when compared to Tokyo. This is because Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City, and earthquakes involve the release of energy stored in rocks when they break. Therefore, with more earthquakes occurring in Tokyo, it is evident that the energy release is higher in Tokyo as opposed to Kansas City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  and a hint : It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Please answer this question : Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower?","output":"Group George's cans had the air molecules inside move slower because they vented their soup cans first, which allowed the pressure inside the cans to release as they were being heated.

Stealing Your Privacy -- It's Google Once Again After weeks of controversy, today Google will formally implement a new privacy policy that will enable the Internet giant to build more complete profiles of you when you interact with Google anywhere on the web. The company's abysmal track record on privacy demonstrates why consumers, elected officials and privacy experts are appalled by the change and by their continued indifference to privacy protections. In fact, when it comes to consumer privacy and Google, it's time to get angry. Google has made apologies and promises to the public, settled a suit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by signing a 20-year consent decree, and attempted to placate Congress with vague descriptions of its privacy and search practices. Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google deliberately circumvented privacy protections in Apple's Safari web browser when used on the iPhone and any computer running Safari. Even when consumers followed Google and Apple's instructions to protect their privacy, the Internet search giant secretly engineered special code to track a user's web browsing. And last week, a group of 36 state attorneys general -- from both political parties -- wrote to Google expressing serious concerns about their upcoming privacy policy changes: \\"[o]n a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one Google product with all Google products.\\" Adding, \\"It rings hollow to call their ability to exit the Google products' ecosystem a \\"choice\\" in an Internet economy where the clear majority of all Internet users use - and frequently rely on - at least one Google product on a regular basis.\\" This latest episode of privacy violations exemplifies Google's dismissive approach to consumer privacy and its willingness to defy legal agreements with government, as well as a firestorm of controversy over its announced privacy policy changes. Just last year, Google settled a suit with the FTC over deceptive privacy practices associated with the launch of its now defunct social networking service Buzz. At the time, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said, \\"This is a tough settlement that ensures that Google will honor its commitments to consumers and build strong privacy protections into all of its operations.\\" Clearly, last year's settlement has not been tough enough. What could be more deceptive and intrusive than telling consumers how to avoid being tracked by using certain browser settings and then deliberately undermining those settings? Google's pattern of deceptive behavior and privacy violations raises a slew of issues with broader marketplace, consumer and regulatory implications. Google has a dominant market presence: its search page is the most visited website in the world and its backend data analysis tools are being used by leading websites. Inevitably, its behavior brings government and public scrutiny that impacts the entire Internet environment. In addition to the 36 attorneys general, a growing chorus of government officials and members of Congress are rightly voicing their concern about Google. Representative Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.) has already said that she will ask Google representatives to return to Capitol Hill to explain the company's latest privacy violations. Unfortunately, it's easy to imagine Google yet again providing elected officials with another round of obfuscation that attempts to dismiss the problem. Time and again, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and other company officials have brushed off critical questions with some version of this answer: \\"It's too technical. You wouldn't understand.\\" This lame appeal to technical functionality is extremely dangerous for the tech industry at large. It challenges government to developing new industry-wide rules that could include cumbersome oversight. Such a regulatory scheme could broadly stifle innovation, if applied overzealously, and it conveniently deflects attention away from Google. If given honest and accurate information about how much of their private information is being harvested by Google and how that information is being used, American consumers can decide which technologies are best suited for them. Unfortunately, Google has proven time and again that if left alone, the company cannot be trusted to be open and transparent with their customers. What, then, can consumers and government do that will improve online privacy protections without over-regulating the Internet? First and foremost, government needs to use current law and regulatory enforcement that truly works. Penalties against Google have not been sufficient to change its behavior, so tougher penalties should be enforced. These penalties -- including tight oversight -- should be focused on the single corporate perpetrator -- Google -- not the tech industry or the Internet at large. Maybe Google should be banned from collecting any online consumer information until the company can abide by its own stated privacy policies. Consumers must also remain vigilant. They need to raise their concerns with their elected officials and, if possible, even take their business elsewhere. Unfortunately, Google dominates so much Internet traffic that it remains virtually impossible to fully escape its reach. -- That's why we need complete answers by Google to explain the extent of their data collection methods across the web and how the information is used to target consumers for ads. To get these answers, lawmakers should demand that Google executives appear before Congress and testify under oath. Then U.S. consumers can make informed decisions about how much of their private information is being collected by Google and how it is being used. American consumers need the facts so they can be responsible for protecting themselves online.

If \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium.\\", does this mean that \\"The two people are watching organized sports.\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium\\" suggests that the two people, a man and a woman, are present in a stadium observing an organized sports event. Here, the context provided allows us to draw a few details and conclusions about the situation. Firstly, sports events are typically organized activities that involve competitive physical exertion or skill-based games, played according to a set of rules. Such events are part of a larger competition or tournament where teams and individual players participate to win or achieve a favorable outcome. The most common organized sports include games like soccer, basketball, football, tennis, baseball, and more. Secondly, watching a sports event in a stadium implies that the man and woman are physically present in the venue. Stadiums are large, open-air or enclosed structures with seating for spectators to view sports events or other entertainment activities. The atmosphere in a stadium is usually energetic, with fans cheering for their preferred team or player. People attend these events to witness the live-action, engage in social interactions, and enjoy the overall experience that televised or digital media may not fully capture. The presence of the man and woman in a stadium watching a sports event indicates that they are indeed observing an organized sports activity. They are likely experiencing the competitiveness, excitement, and camaraderie that such events bring. Sports events often foster a sense of community and belonging among spectators, whether or not they support the same team or athlete. As a result, attending these events can be an exhilarating and entertaining experience for all involved. To summarize, the statement \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium\\" means that \\"The two people are watching organized sports.\\" The organized sports events provide the context for their presence in the stadium, and their engagement in the spectacle highlights the appeal and enjoyment of sports-related activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernard Harris, 53, from London, and Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood, 66, from West Sussex, died after Mrs Sugarhood passed out in the water near Paphos. According to police Mrs Sugarhood went into the water to help her husband Montague - who is known as Norman - who got into difficulty in rough waves. Police say Norman made it back to shore, but Mrs Sugarhood then suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness, at which point Mr Harris swam out in another rescue attempt.

A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...  answer the following question:  What two compositions did Holst write in 1906?

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"the circulatory system transports blood throughout the body\\", how would one answer \\"What makes sure that the tips of your toes have enough of the gas that plants put off?\\" Choose from:  - your circulatory system.  - your pancreas.  - warm socks.  - your nervous system....A:","output":"The question refers indirectly to oxygen, the gas that plants release during photosynthesis, which is essential for life in many animals, including humans. The circulatory system in the human body plays a significant role in transporting this gas distributed by plants to all parts of the body, including to the tips of your toes.   Let's take a detailed look at how this process occurs: The circulatory or cardiovascular system is comprised of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. Its primary role is to transport various substances throughout the body, and it acts much like a network of roads facilitating the movement of important elements from one location to another. Among the substances it transports are oxygen and nutrients to cells and takes away waste products like carbon dioxide for elimination. Breathing air into your lungs brings oxygen into your body, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through tiny air sacs called alveoli within the lungs. Hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells, has a particular affinity for oxygen, allowing oxygen molecules to bind to it. This oxygen-rich blood is then transported by the circulatory system throughout the body. After leaving the lungs, the oxygen-rich blood arrives at the heart, which pumps it out through the aorta (the large artery leaving the heart) and into a series of smaller arteries and arterioles, eventually leading to capillaries. It's in the network of microscopic capillaries that oxygen is released and diffuses into the body's cells — even those in the distant tips of your toes. Now, let's discuss the options you have given. - Your circulatory system: As explained above, this system plays a vital role in making sure that your toes — and the rest of your tissues, for that matter — receive enough of the gas that plants release, which is oxygen. The circulatory system is the answer to this specific question. - Your pancreas: This organ is part of the digestive system, and its primary functions are to produce insulin for blood sugar regulation and produce enzymes for the breakdown of food. While important, it's not directly involved in the transport of gases like oxygen. - Warm socks: While warm socks serve to keep our feet warm and could have an indirect role in promoting good circulation in cold conditions, they do not have any biological function in the transport of oxygen. - Your nervous system: This system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, controls and coordinates body's activities and enables communication within the body. While playing an important role in regulating heart rate and respiratory rate, it does not physically transport oxygen throughout the body. In conclusion, the circulatory system ensures that the tips of your toes, along with rest of your body's cells, have enough of the oxygen that plants produce and release into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Sasha Bell-Newman, age 13 from Burntisland, a pupil at Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, bullied because she is English. An English-born schoolgirl was left in tears when she became the victim of vicious anti-English abuse in her Scottish secondary school. Sasha Bell-Newman, 13, was told to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ by a fellow pupil. According to Sasha’s mother, Teresa, the pupils have recently been taught about the forthcoming independence referendum and had been encouraged to think about a Scottish national anthem. The distressing incident has sparked fears that internet abuse which has already soured the debate over Scotland’s future is now spreading into everyday life. Yesterday former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the family’s local MP, contacted Mrs Bell-Newman to offer his sympathies. He also said he would contact the local education authority to discuss what happened. Sasha was born in Dorset, but the family moved to Scotland when she was just ten months old after falling in love with the country on holiday. She lives with her 44-year-old mother, 40-year-old father Robert Newman, and four-year old brother Ollie in Burntisland on the Firth of Forth. Mrs Bell-Newman said Sasha, a pupil at Balwearie High in Kirkcaldy, was reduced to tears on Wednesday following the abuse by a fellow classmate. She said: 'My concern is that the situation could possibly get totally out of control if nothing is done now before the referendum vote takes place later in the year. 'The authorities and even the politicians must do something immediately to try and defuse the whole situation before it gets out of hand.' The full-time mother said Sasha’s class recently heard from a minister who visited the school about what would happen in an independent Scotland, and she said the class was discussing an anthem that would ‘embrace Scottishness’ when the incident happened. She said: 'One of her classmates turned to Sasha and said he was glad to have her in their team because she had won several Burns poetry competitions. 'He mentioned that she had achieved this without even being Scottish, a comment that was overhead by another pupil who started to shout and swear at her, telling her to ‘f**k off back to your own country’. 'When I contacted the school later they were extremely apologetic and they have been really good in sorting this out. Balwarie high school in Kirkcaldy, Fife, where Sasha has lived since she was ten months old, after her family took a holiday to Scotland and 'fell in love' with the country. 'But I fear this could be the tip of the iceberg and possibly being experienced by many others because of the passion being whipped up surrounding independence. 'We’re a very British family, but I’m afraid to put a pro-Union sticker in my window.' Mrs Bell-Newman said her daughter was too upset to go to school yesterday, but may return today. On Wednesday evening she contacted Gordon Brown’s office, and yesterday received a personal phone call from the former Prime Minister. Mrs Bell-Newman said: 'He said he was very sorry about what had happened and would contact the education authorities. 'He pointed out that his wife is English and said he hopes that what is happening is by a small minority of Scots.' Mr Brown has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 General Election, but has made something of a comeback in recent weeks with a series of attacks on Scottish nationalism. Last night, James More, rector of Balwearie High School, said: 'Any incident which may be motivated by prejudice is dealt with promptly. 'Discussion has taken place with the parents of both children involved to ensure that no repeat of this behaviour occurs and the matter is resolved in a restorative manner.  As with all schools we deal robustly with incidents which may be motivated by prejudice as they occur, on a case by case basis, in line with Fife Council policy.'

Keane was born into a working class family in Ballinderry Park, Mayfield, Cork. His father, Maurice, took work wherever he could find, which led to jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy's Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family were keen on sport, football especially, and many of his relatives had played for junior clubs in Cork, including Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at the age of nine and trained for a number of years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league. Keane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a blatant knee-high foul on Alf-Inge Haland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge. He initially received a three-match suspension and a PS5,000 fine from The Football Association (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended \\"to hurt\\" Haland. Keane's account of the incident was as follows:  I'd waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.  An admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined PS150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained in an interview that he had no regrets about the incident: \\"My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye\\", and said he would probably do the same thing again.  Haland later implied that the tackle effectively finished his playing career as he never played a full game afterwards.

The device must have a Broadcom bcm4329 or bcm4330 wireless chipset and must be rooted. The Cyanogen ROM will provide the best chance of success. Some of the known supported devices include:  Nexus 7 Galaxy Ace/S1/S2/S3 Nexus One Desire HD This tool enables Monitor Mode on your Broadcom chipset, which is essential for being able to crack the PIN. The bcmon APK file is available for free from the bcmon page on the Google Code website. To install an APK file, you will need to allow installation from unknown sources in your Security menu. Step 2 of this article goes into more detail. After installing the APK file, run the app. If prompted, install the firmware and tools. Tap the \\"Enable Monitor Mode\\" option. If the app crashes, open it and try again. If it fails for the third time, your device is most likely not supported. Your device must be rooted in order to run bcmon. Reaver is a program developed to crack the WPS PIN in order to retrieve the WPA2 passphrase. The Reaver APK can be downloaded from the developers' thread on the XDA-developers forums. Tap the Reaver for Android icon in your App drawer. After confirming that you are not using it for illegal purposes, Reaver will scan for available access points. Tap the access point you want to crack to continue.  You may need to verify Monitor Mode before proceeding. If this is the case, bcmon will open again. The access point you select must accept WPS authentication. Not all routers support this. In most cases you can leave the settings that appear at their default. Make sure that the \\"Automatic advanced settings\\" box is checked. Tap the \\"Start attack\\" button at the bottom of the Reaver Settings menu. The monitor will open and you will see the results of the ongoing crack displayed. Cracking WPS can take anywhere from 2-10+ hours to complete, and it is not always successful.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to crack a WPS PIN on certain Android devices equipped with Broadcom bcm4329 or bcm4330 wireless chipsets, emphasizing that successful attempts largely depend on whether the device is rooted and has the Cyanogen ROM installed. The procedure involves using the bcmon and Reaver applications, which help enable Monitor Mode and retrieve the WPA2 passphrases, respectively. The latter works by scanning available access points that accept WPS authentication, with the cracking process potentially taking 2-10 hours to finish.

She has reluctantly left her young son back home with his grandmother until she is more financially secure. She joins a local church choir which has just gained a new, demanding choirmasterâretired music conductor Ephraim Adams (John Houseman). Adams challenges the choir to dramatically improve, creating discomfort for some of the members, particularly when he sets the high goal of performing Handel's Messiah for a Christmas concert. Meanwhile, the choir overcome personal setbacks as they all deal with personal issues.A teacher by profession, Zoe soon learns no positions are available and that she lacks training to perform more readily available work. Living in an inexpensive flat, she brushes up her typing skills in order to gain employment before her mother wearies of looking after her son, who is growing anxious from his separation from Zoe.Zoe receives her grounding at church, where an assortment of inner-city residents range from a former opera singer to a student seeking to educate himself for a life in a profession. The opera singer falls by the wayside when ego gets in her way, while the student is falsely accused of vandalism simply because of his race, yet is vindicated by those who know and believe in him.

It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus \\"Surnia\\" of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the \\"Ninox\\" genus are also called \\"hawk owls\\".  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Barn - owls ( family Tytonidae ) are one of the two families of owls , the other being the true owls or typical owls , Strigidae . They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart - shaped faces . They have long , strong legs with powerful talons . They also differ from Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet . The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly .  - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.  - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\")  that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl.  - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting.  - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'barn-owl' with the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

Math Problem Solve 323*b - 368*b = -37 - 278 for b.","output":"To solve the equation 323*b - 368*b = -37 - 278 for \\"b\\", follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation.  First, notice that we have 323*b and -368*b in the equation. We can combine these terms, as they both contain the variable \\"b\\". 323*b - 368*b = -45*b So, the simplified equation now is: -45*b = -37 - 278 Step 2: Combine the constants. Now, combine the constants on the right side of the equation. -37 - 278 = -315 The equation now becomes: -45*b = -315 Step 3: Solve for \\"b\\". To solve for \\"b\\", we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by -45. -45*b / -45 = -315 / -45 This simplifies to: b = 7 The solution for the equation 323*b - 368*b = -37 - 278 is: b = 7"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chandramohan showed an interest in the character , but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu . Chandramohan showed interest in character , but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu .","output":"While both sentences convey similar information, they have slight differences in their meanings due to the variation in word choice and structure. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: Sentence 1: Chandramohan showed an interest in the character, but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. Sentence 2: Chandramohan showed interest in the character, but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. 1. Use of the article \\"an\\": In the first sentence, the indefinite article \\"an\\" is used before the word \\"interest,\\" indicating a specific type of interest that Chandramohan had in the character. The use of \\"an\\" here makes the meaning slightly more emphatic and precise. In the second sentence, the article \\"an\\" is omitted, making the sentence sound more casual and less specific about the nature of Chandramohan's interest. 2. Use of the preposition \\"in\\": In the first sentence, the preposition \\"in\\" is used after \\"interest,\\" which means that Chandramohan showed interest \\"in\\" a specific character. This construction emphasizes the object of interest, i.e., the character. In the second sentence, the preposition \\"in\\" is missing, making the sentence less formal in structure. Although the intended meaning is still clear, the sentence appears more colloquial in nature without the preposition. To sum up, the two sentences do convey a similar overall message - that Chandramohan was interested in a character that was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. However, the slight differences in word choice and structure lead to nuanced variations in their meanings. The first sentence comes across as more specific and emphatic, whereas the second sentence seems more casual and less precise in terms of the nature of Chandramohan's interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How to Prepare Pound Cake Mix to Make Homemade Twinkies","output":"Making Homemade Twinkies using a pound cake mix is an excellent way to replicate the soft and delicious snack at home. Pound cake mix provides a slightly denser texture compared to the sponge cake used in store-bought Twinkies, but it works great for this home-based version. Here's a detailed step-by-step process on how to prepare pound cake mix to make Homemade Twinkies: Ingredients: 1. One 16-ounce package of pound cake mix (such as Betty Crocker) 2. 2/3 cup water 3. 1/2 cup vegetable oil 4. 3 eggs 5. Cooking spray for greasing 6. Cream filling (recipe below) Tools: 1. Electric mixer 2. Twinkie or mini loaf pan (optional) 3. Pastry bag with a small round tip 4. Wire rack 5. Toothpick or skewer Cream Filling Ingredients: 1. 2 cups marshmallow fluff or marshmallow creme 2. 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 3. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4. 1 cup powdered sugar Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).  2. Spray your Twinkie or mini loaf pan with a light layer of cooking spray, making sure to grease the cavities evenly to prevent sticking. If you don't have a Twinkie or mini loaf pan, you can use a muffin tin or aluminum foil to create molds that have an elongated shape. 3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pound cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Mix the ingredients together using an electric mixer, on low speed, for about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium, and mix for an additional 2 minutes, or until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. 4. Pour the pound cake batter into the prepared Twinkie, mini loaf, or muffin pan, filling each cavity about 2/3 to 3/4 full. Make sure not to overfill them, as the batter will expand when baking. 5. Bake in your preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. The cakes should be golden brown on top. 6. Remove the Twinkies from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack, allowing them to cool completely. 7. While the Twinkies are cooling, prepare the cream filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the marshmallow fluff, softened unsalted butter, and vanilla extract. Using an electric mixer, whisk the ingredients together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and continue mixing until the filling reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. 8. Once the Twinkies have cooled completely, create small holes in the bottom of each using a toothpick or skewer. Be careful not to poke all the way through. 9. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip (about 1/4-inch in diameter) with the prepared cream filling. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into each hole at the bottom of the Twinkies and gently squeeze to fill them with the cream. You should feel the Twinkie expand slightly as you fill it. Wipe away any excess cream that comes out of the holes. 10. Your Homemade Twinkies are now ready to be enjoyed. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Enjoy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Eric took their studies far more seriously than Derrick, because  Options are: (1). Eric was more concerned with drinking.. (2). Derrick was more concerned with drinking..","output":"(2). Derrick was more concerned with drinking. Eric and Derrick were polar opposites when it came to their approach to life. Eric was the introspective, diligent student who lost himself in his studies, while Derrick was more of a social butterfly, focusing more on his social life and the many parties college had to offer.  With both of them being roommates in college, it soon became apparent that Derrick was more concerned with drinking and other indulgences. Perhaps it was his rebellious nature or just the need for another adrenaline rush, Derrick could always be found holding a red solo cup in a crowded room of screaming, dancing students.  Unlike Derrick, Eric had his priorities straight, which included putting his education first. He understood that college was an expensive investment in his future and was determined to get the most out of it. This attitude drove a wedge between the two friends, as Derrick could never understand why someone wouldn't want to participate in the revelry that occurred every weekend on campus.  This contrast in behavior began to create a rift between the roommates. There were times that Derrick missed important lectures and assignments because he was recuperating from the previous night's excessive drinking - and Eric was forced to deal with the ensuing mess. As the semester wore on, Eric's academic performance improved tremendously, so much so that he was on the verge of earning a prestigious scholarship. The professors recognized his hard work and dedication, which only served to motivate him to aim higher. Meanwhile, Derrick started to realize the consequences of his incessant partying. His grades were slipping, and he found himself struggling to maintain the desired GPA. No matter how much he studied, he was unable to catch up with the academics he had neglected. Worried for his friend, Eric tried to talk to Derrick about the future and the importance of focused efforts on academics. Yet, despite the seriousness of his intentions, Eric couldn't break through the barrier Derrick had erected around his beliefs. Derrick, in a moment of realization, began to evaluate his actions. He suddenly understood that he was jeopardizing his future for fleeting pleasures. At first, this epiphany put a temporary halt to his drinking, but it wasn't long before he was back to his old ways. After the semester ended, the differences between the two roommates continued to grow. Eric received numerous awards at the college's annual ceremony, including the prestigious scholarship that he had set his sights on. Derrick, on the other hand, found himself on the brink of dismissal due to his deplorable academic performance. With summer unfolding, both roommates returned home. From that point on, their paths diverged significantly. Eric continued with his dedication to academics, earning a degree with honors, and later pursuing a successful career in his chosen field. Derrick, unfortunately, spiraled deeper into the world of alcohol and parties. Their contrasting choices demonstrate the long-term effects of personal decisions. Eric's focus on his studies allowed him to establish a stable and thriving career, while Derrick's obsession with drinking resulted in a myriad of personal and financial issues. Through the lives of these roommates, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of prioritizing academics and safeguarding one's future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where is a good place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at? Possible A: kitchen, tea room, china cabinet, kitchen cabinet, cup  Why is \\"china cabinet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"A china cabinet, sometimes referred to as a china hutch, is an answer that aligns with human common sense because of several reasons. Firstly, it serves the dual purposes of storage and display for fine china, decorative dishes, and other ornamental items, including saucers. This makes it an ideal place to keep a saucer that you don't necessarily use, but want to have on display. China cabinets are specifically designed with aesthetic appeal and functionality in mind. They typically include glass or transparent doors, which allow the contents to be easily visible, showcasing the beauty of your saucer while also keeping it dust-free and protected. This feature makes it an attractive and safe option for displaying delicate or valuable items like a cherished saucer. Furthermore, china cabinets are usually placed in dining rooms, living rooms, or other social areas of the home, making it the perfect location to display your beautiful saucer where guests and family members are likely to see and appreciate it. By placing the saucer in the china cabinet, you demonstrate that the saucer has importance and sentimental value to you, and you want to share its beauty with others. Additionally, china cabinets are designed not only to display fine china but also to protect it from potential damage or accidental knocks. They often include built-in grooves or plate racks to keep your saucer and other pieces steady and secure. This solid support, coupled with the cabinet's enclosed design, provides a safe environment for your saucer, reducing the risk of damage over time. Unlike other possible answers like the kitchen, tea room, or kitchen cabinet, a china cabinet provides a dedicated space specifically designed for showcasing and preserving delicate and special items like saucers. While a cup may be used to display the saucer, it doesn't provide the same level of protection or visual appeal as a china cabinet.  In conclusion, \\"china cabinet\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it offers an ideal combination of display, protection, and organization for your saucer. It enables you to showcase the saucer in a prominent location, where it can be appreciated by yourself and others, while simultaneously protecting it from dust, accidents, and potential damage. It is a purpose-built piece of furniture that caters specifically to the needs and desires of those who own and value fine china and other decorative items such as your cherished saucer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like  Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

The new person, whose name I later learned to be Alex, had caught me off guard, and I was immediately defensive. But that brief interaction sparked my curiosity about snoring, its causes, and how to control it. First, let's understand what snoring is. Snoring occurs when the flow of air through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. This blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate, producing the familiar sound of snoring. Several factors can contribute to snoring, including nasal congestion, obesity, alcohol consumption, and sleep position. Now that we know what causes snoring, let's explore some ways to control it, especially in public settings: 1. Maintain a healthy weight: Obesity can lead to excess fatty tissue in the throat area, which narrows the airway and makes it more difficult for air to flow freely. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help alleviate snoring. 2. Sleep on your side: Sleeping on your back can cause your tongue and soft palate to collapse to the back of your throat, partially blocking the airway and increasing the likelihood of snoring. Sleeping on your side may help prevent this. 3. Nasal decongestants: If nasal congestion is causing your snoring, over-the-counter nasal decongestants and saline sprays can help clear the airway and reduce snoring. 4. Limit alcohol consumption: Alcohol relaxes the muscles in the throat, which can contribute to snoring. Reducing your alcohol intake, especially in the evening, can help minimize snoring. 5. Proper sleep hygiene: Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a comfortable sleep environment can promote better sleep quality, which may, in turn, help reduce snoring. 6. Anti-snoring mouthpieces: In some cases, specially designed mouthpieces can help prevent snoring. These devices work by shifting the lower jaw forward or holding the tongue in place, thereby opening the airway. 7. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy: For individuals with sleep apnea, a medical condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, a CPAP machine may be necessary. These machines provide a steady stream of air pressure to the user, effectively eliminating snoring and other sleep apnea symptoms. 8. Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be required to treat snoring. Surgical procedures aimed at treating snoring focus on removing excess tissue from the throat or reconstructing the airway to facilitate better breathing. Of course, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you are concerned about snoring or believe it may be related to an underlying health condition. They can recommend the appropriate course of treatment based on your individual needs. In conclusion, while it may have been embarrassing to be called out for snoring in public, this experience led me to research and better understand the causes and potential solutions for snoring. By implementing some of the strategies mentioned above, many people can successfully control their snoring and ultimately improve their sleep quality and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The 15-year-old from Massachusetts endured seven days of beatings and sexual torture by a Long Island couple she met through the Internet, who later coerced her to New York - and then \\"loaned\\" her for two days to a Queens man who abused her as a sex slave as well, police said. The girl's first contact with the couple came months ago, when she met James Warren, 41, in an America Online chat room and told him she wanted to run away from the home where she lived with her parents. They arranged to meet in Wrentham, Mass., on Aug. 3, and Warren brought along Beth Loschin, 46. The teen got in their car, \\"and after about an hour, she knew she was in over her head,\\" said Nassau County Detective Lt. Vincent Robustelli. They spent one night at a motel near Providence, R.I., where the couple raped her, and then drove to Loschin's and Warren's homes, where the attacks continued, police said. On Wednesday, the couple even forced her to call cops in her suburban Boston hometown of Wrentham and made her say she was okay and heading to California. But, police said, she was headed instead to the Astoria, Queens, apartment of Michael Montez. Warren and Loschin \\"told her they were going to loan her to Michael,\\" according to the criminal complaint. \\"If she did not do what Michael wanted, they would beat her more . . . and would kill her and get rid of her.\\" The girl was told to wear high heels and black lingerie for Montez, prosecutors said. Montez allegedly stuffed the teen's ears with toilet paper, used bandages to cover her eyes and locked her in a closet. Prosecutors said he tied a rope around the girl's neck and anchored the other end to a clothes rack. It wasn't until Friday, the seventh day of her ordeal, back in Loschin's home in Farmingdale, L.I., that the girl managed to snoop around the cluttered residence, police said. With the couple outside, she found the cell phone they had taken from her and quietly called Wrentham police, who had been looking for her and left her a message checking on her well-being. When she asked for help but said she didn't know where she was, they told her to try to find some mail. She did, and minutes later Nassau County cops were at the house, arresting Loschin, a divorced mother of two, and Warren, a computer repairman from Hampton Bays, L.I. Law enforcement sources said the girl's injuries included trauma to her genital area, strangulation marks on her neck and hemorrhaging in her eyes, a result of choking. She was being treated at a Nassau hospital yesterday and expected to return home with her mother. Warren faces kidnapping, sodomy, rape and sexual abuse charges. Police said he had been convicted in Connecticut of a child-related offense in 1979 and served three years in jail. Loschin was charged with several counts of sodomy and sexual abuse. Cops arrested Montez, 35, on Saturday. He was expected to be arraigned last night on kidnapping, rape and sodomy charges. Loschin's neighbors said she was distant and rarely socialized outside the home. They noted that her lawn rarely is mowed and that her ranch-style house is dark and dreary.

Article: TRENTON — The state Supreme Court ruled today that notebooks filled with gangster rap lyrics written by a man accused of attempted murder cannot be used as evidence to help prove a motive.      A trial court convicted Vonte Skinner of shooting and paralyzing a drug dealer, Lamont Peterson, during a 2005 incident in Willingboro Township — based in part on pages of violent and graphic rap lyrics that police found in a car Skinner was driving at the time.      An appellate court later threw out Skinner's conviction, saying the judge shouldn't have allowed prosecutors for the state to read the lyrics to the jury.      The Supreme Court voted 6-0 today to uphold the appellate ruling and ordered a new trial for Skinner.      Justice Jaynee LaVecchia wrote that using the lyrics as evidence was \\"highly prejudicial,\\" \\"bore little or no probative value\\" as to any motive in the shooting, and \\"risked poisoning the jury.\\"      \\"One would not presume that Bob Marley, who wrote the well-known song 'I Shot the Sheriff,' actually shot a sheriff, or that Edgar Allan Poe buried a man beneath his floorboards, as depicted in his short story 'The Tell-Tale Heart,' simply because of their respective artistic endeavors on those subjects,\\" LaVecchia wrote. \\"The Court reasons that defendant's lyrics should receive no different treatment.\\"      Civil liberties advocates watched the case closely, saying lyrics are a form of artistic expression and should be protected as free speech. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey wrote a brief in Skinner's support, arguing that rap lyrics are \\"often a vehicle for social and political commentary\\" and that admitting these as evidence would run \\"the risk of chilling otherwise valuable speech.\\"      Skinner was convicted in 2008 of shooting Peterson seven times at close range, leaving the victim paralyzed from the waist down. Peterson testified that he and Skinner sold drugs as part of a three-man team and that the shooting happened after an argument arose.      In his own testimony, Skinner said Peterson was shot by another man.      As part of the trial, prosecutors read from Skinner's lyrics, which depict shootings, knifings, and rapes. One verse read: \\"A (racial epithet) wouldn't listen so I hit him with the Smithen; hauled off 15 rounds, seven missed him; Two to the mask and six to the ribs, lifted and flipped him. The safe street squad found him, half his shell mission.\\"      But prosecutors did not tell jurors when Peterson wrote them. All the lyrics were written \\"long before\\" the shooting — some four or five years before, according to the ruling.      Joseph Glyn, a state deputy attorney general, told the Supreme Court in April that the lyrics were evidence of Skinner's \\"continuing mindset.\\"      \\"These lyrics explain why defendant did what he did,\\" Glyn said.      Jason Coe, Skinner's public defender, argued that lyrics could be used as evidence only \\"when there are particular, detailed accounts about the crime charged.\\" In Indiana, a man who killed his mother and placed her body in the trunk of a car wrote lyrics describing the same actions. The court admitted those words as evidence.      In today's opinion, LaVecchia wrote that lyrics can be used as evidence of guilt if they connect strongly to the details of the crime the defendant is charged with committing or if they mention the victim by name. But, she added, Skinner's lyrics did neither.      \\"The lyrics can only be regarded as fictional accounts,\\" LaVecchia wrote. \\"The state has produced no evidence otherwise.\\" ||||| In 2005 prosecutors in New Jersey pointed to the violent rap lyrics written by a criminal suspect as evidence of that man's \\"motive and intent\\" to commit murder and other misdeeds. During the trial, those lyrics—which had zero connection to the actual crimes at issue—were read to the jury, which ultimately voted to convict the man of attempted murder.      In an opinion issued on Monday, the New Jersey Supreme Court nullified that verdict, ordering a new trial on the grounds that \\"the violent, profane, and disturbing rap lyrics authored by defendant constituted highly prejudicial evidence against him that bore little or no probative value as to any motive or intent behind the attempted murder offense with which he was charged.\\" Unless such material has \\"a direct connection to the specifics of the offense,\\" the court ruled, prosecutors are forbidden from introducing it as evidence.      The New Jersey Supreme Court got it right. As the ACLU noted in an amicus brief it filed in the case, \\"that a rap artist wrote lyrics seemingly embracing a world of violence is no more reason to ascribe to him a motive and intent to commit violent acts\\" than it would be \\"to indict Johnny Cash for having 'shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.'\\"      The New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling in State v. Skinner is available here. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that rap lyrics written by a man accused of attempted murder cannot be used as evidence to help prove a motive.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which happened earlier, Newfoundland reverted to colonial status or the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration? Context: The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name. The answer to this question is:","output":"The 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration earlier than Newfoundland reverting to colonial status.

News article: Bookkeeper steals 650K from Bronx real estate biz: DA A conniving bookkeeper looted 650,000 from a 114-year-old Bronx real estate company, nearly forcing the venerable family business to shut its doors, authorities charged Tuesday. Defendant Chetandeo (Ray) Brij-Raj pleaded not guilty in Bronx Supreme Court to three felony charges in the alleged massive five-year ripoff of Schmidt Realty, according to a Bronx criminal complaint. The suspect wrote himself hundreds of checks between May 2006 and September 2011, forging his boss' signature on each one, the Bronx District Attorney's office said. Brij-Raj, 45, who was responsible for handling the company's rents and expenses, then altered the books at Schmidt Realty to cover his crooked tracks, prosecutors said. The bookkeeper, in an unrelated case, already faces a federal discrimination lawsuit filed last year for his refusal to show available Bronx rental properties to potential black tenants. A WNBC-TV new investigation caught Brij-Raj's actions with a hidden camera. The defendant began working as a rental agent after he was fired from Schmidt when the financially-crippling scam was discovered, authorities said. The real estate company's owner, the third generation of the family business, was forced to sell more than half his properties and mortgage his home to keep Schmidt afloat. Brij-Raj entered his not guilty pleas to charges of grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and criminal possession of a forged instrument. The defendant, accompanied by a female friend, was released on 150,000 cash bail pending another court appearance on March 31. Both he and his attorney declined comment following the hearing. Brij-Raj faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Firstly, let's break down the process step by step: 1. A forest fire starts 2. The trees and plants burn 3. The animals lose their homes 4. If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation 5. The plants that provide food are gone 6. The animals have little to eat Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was no forest in the area, and the area is more dry than usual. In this scenario, - There would be no trees and plants to burn, so steps 1, 2, and 5 in the process would not occur. - Since there is no forest, the animals would either not inhabit the area or have adapted to living in a non-forest environment. Therefore, steps 3 and 6 in the process would not apply. However, if the area is more dry than usual, it might indirectly affect the process in the following ways: - The dry conditions increase the likelihood of wildfires in any nearby forests or grasslands, which in turn could start a fire closer to the animals' homes than it was initially. - If there were any plants present in the area, the dry conditions might cause them to wither and die, indirectly impacting the animals' food source. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis (no forest and the area being more dry than usual) would have a significant effect on the process. It would prevent the forest fire from directly impacting the animals in the area as they are not in a forest environment. However, the increased dryness may indirectly affect nearby environments where fires could then impact the animals' habitat or food sources."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage:Antoni Chruściel was born on 16 July 1895 in the village of Gniewczyna Łańcucka halfway between Łańcut and Przeworsk, to Andrzej Chruściel, a local farmer and the vogt of that village. In 1909, while still a student at a local gymnasium in Jarosław, Chruściel joined the secret scouting troop; he was also active in the Zarzewie movement. In 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War he moved to Lwów, where he joined the Eastern Legion. Soon afterwards, as a citizen of Austria-Hungary, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. After graduating from an NCO school in May 1915 he served at various posts, including his service as a commanding officer of a company of the 90th Infantry Regiment. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the chaos at the eastern front, Chruściel's regiment was the only unit in the entire Austro-Hungarian Army to return to the barracks as an organized entity and with arms. Few weeks later Chruściel, together with most of his unit, joined the newly formed Polish Army. A:","output":"a"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, \\"There were five of you; now there are six\\". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not...

Here is a question about this article: Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work Four Orations against the Arians and defended his own recent conduct in the Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — Giving money to every panhandling homeless person you see in San Francisco would quickly bankrupt you, but social entrepreneur Anthony Bustos has a solution — he doesn’t give them money, he gives them a better marketing plan in the form of a clearer, more clever, and larger sign to hold.      “Someone Thinks You’re Sexy,” “Law School Isn’t Cheap,” “Keanu Reeves Is My Homeboy,” and “Everyone Has A Dream — Mine Includes You Sparing Some Change” are among his favorites, but this sign, held by an older homeless man and posted to Instagram may have caught the most attention: “Hogwarts or Bust.”            “At the core of this idea is a simple way to help a human being be more efficient at what they’re doing,” Bustos tells CBS SF. “My hope every time I pass out a sign is that it actually increases the person’s income.”      The idea came while driving down Van Ness Avenue and seeing a typically small, shabby and poorly written sign saying, “Poor, hungry.” Bustos said, “I had no inclination to give alms to this man and wondered if I would feel differently were something different written on the sign.”      As his Twitter profile says, “This man didn’t need money, he needed a better sign.” Still, he figures even if the signs don’t increase donations, at least a driver might smile a bit as they saw the transient.      “The idea is just as much about sending positive vibes to the city’s commuters as it is helping the homeless,” Bustos said.      Approaching a homeless person and offering an innovative marketing strategy is a delicate process.      “The reactions have been mixed and have taught me a lot about homeless culture, and the individuals that are behind the signs,” Bustos said.      Typically, Bustos will roll up to a panhandler, and say, “Hey man, I don’t have any money for you today, but I do have a bad-ass sign, would you like to take a look?”      He always lets the person choose their own sign, and then he asks if he can take their picture holding it. “This is their favorite part, they always say ‘yes,'” he said.      Some people get the humor in Bustos signs, and are thankful. Others may be intoxicated or mentally ill, but take the sign and hold it nonetheless. Bustos admits there are plenty who wanted money, not marketing, and they’re belligerent. Others have a sense of pride for the signs they already have.      “They put the time and effort into making their own signs, and feel like it’s a way they can express themselves. They don’t want a sign that I made, because it doesn’t represent them as individuals,” Bustos said.      Bustos, known on Twitter as @dailysmirks, is a bit of a wanderer himself. The one-time University of Utah student has been a caterer, bartender, oil field worker, street evangelist, dog trainer, and door-to-door salesmen. He dabbles in poetry and hip-hop, and loves golf.      This eclectic background and mix of urban street smarts with higher pursuits puts him in a unique position to do some good.      “I want to leave a positive footprint on our world during my short time here. If possible, I’d like to leave it in better shape than I found it. I love making people smile and laugh.”      With the 15 signs he’s distributed in his first round, he’s already succeeded, and he has many more in the works. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO, CA (KPIX/CNN) - Anthony Bustos’s philosophy is simple: Getting a little change starts with a smile. “I thought this was an easy way I can help these guys increase their income,” he said.      He’s talking about signs he’s made. “The Government stole my sunscreen,” one reads. Another: “I’m way too sober for this.”      He’s handed out at least fifteen so far, giving the homeless a marketing makeover in hopes a laugh translates to a donation. He keeps spare signs in his car so when he’s driving and sees someone who needs it, he has it immediately ready.      “I kind of just wait for the right person and if I feel like they’re standing out there with a sign that can be improved, I roll the window down and say, ‘hey, you guys want a new sign?’”      This social experiment started a few months ago. He was driving down a street and saw a panhandler with a sign that just said “poor hungry.”      “I had no inclination to give him any money, and I was wondering if something funny were written on the sign, would I give him some money, and I decided I probably would have.”      And it’s working for some. One man told Anthony his sign was attracting a lot of tourists, some even asking to take pictures with him.      Anthony says he’s not really in a position to help someone find a job, but says, “I’m a regular guy so I think we all kind of do what we’re capable of.”      He says his friends want to help, too, by either making signs or inspiring catchy phrases.      “We don’t always have to change the world. We can do something small to make a small difference, and that’s ok.”      And Anthony says the signs have definitely changed him.      Copyright 2014 KPIX via CNN.

Given the question: Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place.  Question: suppose water has no effect. happens, how will it affect the wind moves sediment.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"A: more. Without water to help move and transport sediment, wind becomes the primary agent responsible for this process. As a result, wind's role in moving sediment becomes even more significant. In a scenario where water has no effect on the sediment transportation process, wind has to take up the responsibility of moving those particles. Even though other mechanisms such as gravity might still play a part in moving sediment, wind would be the primary driver. Consequently, the wind moves more sediment in this scenario. Wind has the ability to transport fine particles over considerable distances, leading to the formation of various landforms, such as sand dunes and loess deposits. Wind erosion and deposition would likely increase when water is not present to transport the sediment. As more particles become suspended in the air, the wind's capacity to carry sediment increases, leading to increased sediment transportation. Moreover, without water to help compact and bind the soil particles together, the particles would be more vulnerable to the erosive forces of the wind. This, in turn, might accelerate the process of wind erosion and sediment transportation. It is important to note that both wind and water play crucial roles in shaping our planet's landscapes. They work together, and sometimes against each other, to move and deposit sediments that lead to the formation of diverse landforms. If one of these agents were no longer effective, as in the hypothetical scenario presented where water has no effect on sediment transportation, the other agent's role would be significantly amplified. In this case, wind would be responsible for moving more sediment than it would in a situation where water was also an active participant in the transport process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour.  The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

However, following a series of recent developments and the continuous pursuit of justice, a new appeal has been made for information about the case. The Victim and the Crime Scene On a fateful day in 1972, a woman was found murdered in her own home, with signs of a severe struggle evident throughout the residence. The room in which she was discovered had been ransacked and most of her belongings were scattered. Most shockingly, the word \\"ripper\\" had been sprayed onto the living room wall in what appeared to be the victim's own blood. The chosen weapon was never recovered, and authorities were unable to identify any leads through existing forensic technologies of the time. The Investigation At the time of the crime, police went to great lengths to try and solve the mysterious murder. The case garnered widespread attention and fear, owing to the chilling message left at the crime scene, and the media played a significant role in amplifying public awareness. Due to the cryptic reference to the infamous \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders, investigators initially focused their efforts on possible links to the historical killer. However, as time went on and the case remained unsolved, the trail grew cold, leaving the victim's family and friends without closure. New Appeals and Developments In recent years, advancements in forensic technology have opened new avenues of investigation for cold cases. DNA samples that were previously unusable can now be analyzed, allowing for the identification of potential suspects and exonerating those who were falsely accused in the past. As part of a renewed interest in the 1972 \\"Ripper\\" murder case, local law enforcement agencies have been reexamining old evidence with modern forensic methods. Simultaneous to this, a new public appeal for information has been made, encouraging individuals who may have had knowledge of the crime or familiarity with the victim to come forward and assist in the resolution of this once-stagnant investigation. The Impact on the Community The original impact of the \\"Ripper\\" murder cannot be underestimated. Town safety measures were increased, families took extra precautions, and a pervasive shadow loomed over the entire community. The reemergence of the case, along with the new appeal for information, has brought back memories for many of the unsolved crime, its chilling implications, and the continued pursuit of justice. Conclusion The 1972 \\"Ripper\\" murder case remains a haunting enigma in criminal history.

One can be arrested for insulting them. Allowing","output":"for the strict rules against insulting religious figures in Iran, Khameneh's actions on Facebook eventually caught the attention of the Iranian authorities. This online activity led to a warrant for his arrest, causing him fear for his own safety. Despite being far from his homeland, Khameneh realized that the danger also extended to his family members still in Iran. As a result of Khameneh's actions on social media, his father was arrested by the Iranian authorities. He is being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where he is reportedly facing harsh treatment, including torture and severe interrogation. Iranian authorities are likely using his father's detention as leverage to force Khameneh to return to his home country and face justice for his online activities. Yashar Khameneh, along with his friends, collegemates, and concerned individuals from around the world, have started a global campaign to bring attention to his father's plight and his own legal troubles. Petitions, social media campaigns, and letters to political leaders are all part of an effort to raise awareness about their predicament and the broader issue of freedom of speech in Iran.  The movement catches the attention of international human rights organizations, which denounce the Iranian government's actions as gross violations of human rights. These organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, work diligently to bring pressure on the Iranian authorities for the release of Khameneh's father and advocate for a change in Iran's blasphemy laws that inhibit freedom of expression. Meanwhile, Khameneh who continues to be a target for Iranian authorities, seeks asylum in the Netherlands. He fears that the Iranian government may try to force his extradition, should he return to Iran voluntarily or otherwise. The Dutch government, understanding the gravity of his situation, grants him political asylum in their country. This allows Khameneh to continue his studies without fear of immediate persecution, while he continues advocating for his father's release. As the international pressure grows, the Iranian government is forced to reconsider its stance on the case of Khameneh's father. Although they refuse to publicly acknowledge any wrongdoing, behind the scenes, negotiations take place to secure his release. After months of diplomatic efforts and growing public pressure, the Iranian authorities finally decide to release Khameneh's father from prison on the condition of a well-hidden compromise. While Yashar Khameneh's father is eventually released and reunited with his family in Iran, this ordeal serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that individuals in Iran face when exercising their freedom of expression. The story of the Khameneh family, however, becomes a symbol of hope and resilience for those advocating for the protection and expansion of human rights across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Andrej Kramaric has been told he must hit the ground running for Leicester in their bid to beat the drop as the Premier League’s bottom side ready themselves for an unrelenting run of fixtures. Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer knows his team need goals instantly with games against Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City within the space of a month — and spelt that out to his new team-mate. Kramaric played 30 minutes in the defeat against Stoke which undermined Leicester’s recent revival, following the Croatian striker’s £9.3million move from Rijeka after a successful work-permit appeal. Andrej Kramaric signed for Leicester this week, and made his first appearance against Stoke on Saturday. Kramaric (centre) shakes hands with manager Nigel Pearson as he readies himself to come on for the Foxes. Fans are excited by the prospect of the new £9.3 million man - one supporter holds a shirt outside the ground. The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 31 games this season but had not played for a month before Saturday. ‘It is hard. He’s just come over and he gets thrown into the action,’ said Hamer. ‘Really, he’s got to make an instant impact. Hopefully he can. He hasn’t got time to settle down because we haven’t got that opportunity. Time is of the essence. ‘He’s been sharp in training. I’ve been impressed with him.’ Hamer, 27, has stepped up to replace Kasper Schmeichel, who is out for a few more weeks after breaking a metatarsal. Leicester keeper Ben Hamer (right) has been impressed with Kramaric in training in his first week at the club. Bojan, labelled by Mark Hughes as one of his best ever signings, won the game with a single goal for Stoke. Pearson said there is no guarantee Kasper Schmeichel will come straight back into the Leicester team. Leicester have scored just three goals in their last seven home league games. Manager Nigel Pearson said there was no guarantee the Danish goalkeeper would come straight back into his team once fit, nor that Mark Schwarzer, signed from Chelsea aged 42, would get a game either. ‘I will make the decision on who plays based on who I think is best at any given time,’ said Pearson. ‘Nobody has a divine right to play and I have been pretty pleased with Ben since he has been in the side.’ Bojan scored a superb goal to win the game, his fourth in 10 appearances to cement his status as one of the best value signings last summer. His modest cost of £500,000 is put into context by the price needed to bring Kramaric to England, or the £25m to take Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. Highlights:","output":"1. Andrej Kramaric is a soccer player who recently joined the Leicester team. 2. He needs to help his team beat other strong teams in upcoming games. 3.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — Devoted customers of Apple products these days worry about whether the new iPhone 6 will bend in their jean pockets. The National Security Agency and the nation’s law enforcement agencies have a different concern: that the smartphone is the first of a post-Snowden generation of equipment that will disrupt their investigative abilities.      The phone encrypts emails, photos and contacts based on a complex mathematical algorithm that uses a code created by, and unique to, the phone’s user — and that Apple says it will not possess.      The result, the company is essentially saying, is that if Apple is sent a court order demanding that the contents of an iPhone 6 be provided to intelligence agencies or law enforcement, it will turn over gibberish, along with a note saying that to decode the phone’s emails, contacts and photos, investigators will have to break the code or get the code from the phone’s owner.      Breaking the code, according to an Apple technical guide, could take “more than 5 1/2 years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers.” (Computer security experts question that figure, because Apple does not fully realize how quickly the N.S.A. supercomputers can crack codes.) ||||| Photo by Lucy Nicholson/Reuters      Last week Apple released its new iOS 8 operating system for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch devices. Most of the coverage of iOS 8 focuses on visible features that users can interact with. But there’s one major change in iOS 8 that most users probably won’t notice unless they find themselves in a great deal of trouble. Specifically, Apple has radically improved the way that data on those devices is encrypted. Once users set a passcode, Apple will no longer be able to unlock your device—even if ordered to do so by a court.      While privacy advocates have praised Apple’s move, it has drawn fire from some notable legal scholars. Writing in the Washington Post on Sept. 19, Orin Kerr referred to Apple’s new policy as a “dangerous game,” one that “doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents” but “only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.” While Kerr has moderated his views since his initial post, his overarching concern remains the same: By placing customer interests before that of law enforcement, Apple is working against the public interest. If you interpret Apple’s motivations as Kerr does, then Apple’s recent move is pretty surprising. Not only has the company picked a pointless fight with the United States government, it’s potentially putting the public at risk.      The only problem is that Kerr is wrong about this. Apple is not designing systems to prevent law enforcement from executing legitimate warrants. It’s building systems that prevent everyone who might want your data—including hackers, malicious insiders, and even hostile foreign governments—from accessing your phone. This is absolutely in the public interest. Moreover, in the process of doing so, Apple is setting a precedent that users, and not companies, should hold the keys to their own devices.      Advertisement            To see why this is the case, you need to know a bit about what Apple is doing with its new technology. The first time you power up a new iPhone or iPad, you’ll be asked to set a passcode for unlocking your phone. This can be a full password or just a 4-digit PIN (though the former is certainly stronger). On devices with a Touch ID sensor, you’ll also be allowed to use your fingerprint as a more convenient alternative.      Get Future Tense in your inbox.      A passcode may look like flimsy security, but it’s not. The minute you set one, Apple’s operating system immediately begins encrypting your phone’s sensitive data—including mail, texts, photos, and call records—using a form of encryption that the U.S. government uses to protect classified military secrets. The key for this encryption is mathematically derived by combining your passcode with a unique set of secret numbers that are baked into your phone.      If all goes well, you’ll never notice this is happening. But the impact on data raiders is enormous. Even if someone cracks your phone open and attempts to read data directly off of the memory chips, all she’ll see is useless, scrambled junk. Guessing your passcode won’t help her—unless she can also recover the secret numbers that are stored within your phone’s processor. And Apple’s latest generation of phones makes that very difficult. Of course, your would-be data thief could try to get in by exhaustively trying all possible combinations, but according to an iOS security document, Apple also includes protections to slow this attack down. (In the same document, Apple estimates that a 6-digit alphanumeric password could take upward of five years to guess.)      That’s the problem with keys. If you have them, sooner or later someone is going to ask you to use them.      The encryption on Apple devices is not entirely new with iOS 8. What is new is the amount of data your phone will now encrypt. Apple has extended encryption protections to nearly all the data you produce on a daily basis and will also require you to enter the passcode (or fingerprint) each time you reboot your phone. In addition, if you purchase a recent iPhone (5S, 6, or 6 Plus), Apple will store your keys within a dedicated hardware encryption “co-processor” called the Secure Enclave.      Advertisement            Taking Apple’s recent privacy announcements at face value, even Apple itself can’t break into the Secure Enclave in your phone. While it may seem “natural” that the designer of a system—in this case Apple—can break its own encryption, the truth is that such a capability is hardly an inevitable design outcome. For Apple to maintain such a capability with its newer security processors, it can’t just be more knowledgeable than its customers. It would have to literally design in a form of “skeleton key.” In computer security circles this mechanism is generally known as a “backdoor.”      Designing backdoors is easy. The challenge is in designing backdoors that only the right people can get through. In order to maintain its access to your phone, Apple would need a backdoor that allowed them to execute legitimate law enforcement requests, while locking hackers and well-resourced foreign intelligence services out. The problem is so challenging that even the National Security Agency has famously gotten it wrong.      To dive into the technical weeds, any backdoor Apple might design would likely require the company to store some sort of master access key—or even a whole database of such keys, one for every phone it sells. In the worst case, these keys might need to be carefully transported from the factory in China, to a locked and guarded room at Apple HQ in Cupertino, California. They would be kept isolated from the Internet to protect them from hackers, and Apple would have to constantly monitor its own employees to prevent abuse. None of this is cheap, and the stakes are high: A data breach involving Apple’s master keys could catastrophically harm the company’s reputation, particularly in the security-conscious enterprise market.      Much of the Apple criticism thus far stems from the perception that Apple is primarily targeting the U.S. government with its new encryption features. But this is shortsighted. Apple currently has retail stores in 14 countries and sells its phones in many more. The United States is not the only government with law enforcement, or with an interest in its citizens’ data.      Advertisement            Fortunately we don’t have to speculate about what those interests might be. Back in 2012, rumors swirled that the Indian government had threatened to ban BlackBerry’s messaging services and had even forced BlackBerry to hand over the encryption keys to that service. BlackBerry denied handing over the keys, but eventually admitted it had built a “lawful intercept” mechanism for the Indian government.      If Apple holds its customers’ keys (or maintains a backdoor into your phone), then the same calculus will soon apply to Apple. That’s the problem with keys. Once you have them, sooner or later someone will expect you to use them. Today those requests originate from police in the United States. Tomorrow they may come from the governments of China or Russia. And while those countries certainly have legitimate crime to prosecute, they’re also well known for using technology to persecute dissidents. Apple may not see either public interest or shareholder value in becoming the world’s superintendent—meekly unlocking the door for whichever nation’s police ask them to.      Apple’s new encryption may not solve this problem entirely—foreign governments could always ban the sale of Apple products or force Apple to redesign. But by approaching the world with a precedent that customers, not Apple, are responsible for the security of their phones, Apple can at least make a credible attempt to stay above the fray. |||||","output":"Apple's new iPhone 6 encrypts emails, photos, and contacts using a complex mathematical algorithm with a unique code created by its user, making it virtually impossible for law enforcement or intelligence agencies to access the device's contents. While privacy advocates have praised Apple's move, some legal scholars argue that by focusing on customer interests, Apple is working against public interest. However, making devices more secure from hackers, malicious insiders, and hostile foreign governments is in the public interest, as it sets a precedent that users, not companies, should hold the keys to their devices. Apple's encryption not only impacts US government interests, but also those in other countries where its phones are sold, adding complexity to the debate about the proper balance between privacy and law enforcement access."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph explains that the 2017 EFL League Two play-off Final, which was held on 28 May 2017 at Wembley Stadium, was contested between Blackpool and Exeter City. Blackpool emerged victorious from this match, winning with a score of 2-1. Consequently, they secured their promotion to League One for the subsequent season, the 2017-2018 season. As there is only one promotion spot available through the play-off final, and Blackpool claimed that spot, this outcome implies that Exeter City were unable to secure a promotion to League One at that time.

Select from the following. a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","output":"a). Yes If the premise \\"My skin is too thick\\" is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"My skin is very thick.\\" To better understand this conclusion, let us break down both statements and analyze their meaning. The premise \\"My skin is too thick\\" suggests that the thickness of the person's skin has surpassed the standard or acceptable level. It highlights a situation in which the skin's thickness is considered excessive or undesirable, implying that it is likely to cause certain issues for the person. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"My skin is very thick\\" maintains that the individual's skin is extraordinarily thick. The adjective \\"very\\" denotes a high degree or amount of a certain quality, in this case, thickness. While this hypothesis does not bring any negative implications, it still refers to an intensified thickness when compared to what might be customary. When we compare these two statements, we can see that they both point to the idea that the person's skin is thicker than the standard level. If someone's skin is \\"too thick,\\" it is safe to assume that it is \\"very thick\\" as well. In both cases, the thickness is beyond what is commonly expected.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the place that was closed in 1970?  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Q: Text: so this didn't happen today, but it was over thanksgiving break in 2012. i lived in south lake tahoe, california, and my parents live in wisconsin. to start the story, i used to be prescribed a large amount of benzodiazepines (klonipin and xanax), as well as live in a city where marijuana is more than acceptable, and on the border of nevada so there are a dozen or so casinos just a few minutes away. if anyone has drank while taking xanax or any other type of benzo, you know that it is a recipe for blacking out, and often disaster.  in my infinite wisdom when i was 22 years old and in the middle of a xanax blackout, i decided to bring a quarter ounce of weed in my carry-on bag that i was packing for my trip home the next day. fast forward to a day later, my girlfriend is dropping me off at the airport in reno, nevada (the closest large airport) and i have taken so many pills that i can barely say goodbye, let alone walk myself into the airport and go through security. i didnt check a bag so all i had was my carry-on, and somehow i made it through security completely fine. i have about 40 minutes before my flight leaves at this point, and i decide to get a drink at the airport bar. i start talking to someone and lose track of time after a couple beers and i hear my name being announced over the loudspeaker. i had almost missed my flight, and i hurried to get on the plane. up until this point everything was fine and i was on my way home. i had a connecting flight in minneapolis that take me on the final leg home. after the flight takes off, i take a couple more of my 2 mg xanax and proceed to order some beers. i dont remember exactly how many beers i had on the plane, but it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 . this combined with 20 plus milligrams of xanax caused me to go into a deep sleep. somewhere during the flight i passed out, however when it came time to get off the plane, no one could wake me up. i was breathing, but basically in a drug and alcohol induced coma. the police were called and they had to basically carry me out of the airport. the last thing i vaguely remember is walking out of the terminal with a police officer on both sides. the next morning at around 5 am i woke up, with both arms restrained in a hospital type bed. i immediately screamed, and a nurse came and untied me. i asked what happened, they informed me of the events, said they had talked to my dad and he had rescheduled my flight for later that morning, handed me all of my stuff along with a police report and my new plane ticket and told me to be on my way. i had a short walk to the airport from the hospital, and i began reading the police report. i had completely forgotten about the weed that i had in my backpack, and the police had found it. in the report it said that they found a container with \\"medical marijuana\\" in it, along with my empty bottle of prescription pills. they took the bud, but somehow i managed to escape that situation without any tickets or criminal charges. my family was extremely worried and disappointed when i didn't show up as scheduled, but in the end everything worked out.  i have been so lucky multiple times in my life, and i thank god that i know better than to do this type of this now. i don't know if i ever actually got arrested either, this whole memory is kinda a blur for obvious reasons. my dad still has the copy of the police report that i was handed after this all happened. maybe i will ask him for it soon and post it if anyone is interested. i also have 2 or 3 other stories that involve me getting extremely lucky, i might post them later separately.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There is more hydrogen happens, how will it affect a LARGER white dwarf star.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If more hydrogen were to be introduced into the vicinity of a larger white dwarf star, it could potentially have an effect on the process. Below, I've outlined some possible outcomes: 1. Accretion of hydrogen onto the white dwarf: If the additional hydrogen is gravitationally attracted to the white dwarf and begins accumulating on its surface, it could create an accretion layer. This process could lead to increased mass and pressure at the core of the white dwarf. 2. Ignition of the accreted hydrogen layer: If the accreted hydrogen layer becomes dense and hot enough, it may ignite due to nuclear fusion, creating a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf. This event, known as a nova, causes a temporary increase in the star's brightness and may lead to expulsion of some outer layers. 3. Potential type Ia supernova: In more extreme cases, if the white dwarf's mass increases beyond the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses) due to the continuous accretion of hydrogen, the star cannot support itself against gravitational collapse. This may result in a type Ia supernova explosion, in which the white dwarf is completely disrupted, and its material is expelled into space. 4. Possible rejuvenation of the white dwarf: In some cases, a constant influx of additional hydrogen could potentially lead to \\"rejuvenation\\" of the white dwarf, stabilizing the star for a longer period and preventing it from cooling down as quickly. In conclusion, the introduction of more hydrogen could have a variety of direct and indirect effects on a larger white dwarf star, depending on the amount of hydrogen, proximity to the white dwarf, and various other factors. These effects could range from minimal impact to drastic changes in the star's evolution, potentially causing novae or supernovae in extreme cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home.  For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries.  \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize.  \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\"  It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague.  The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue.

Article: Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first major American movie, Roman Holiday, which was showed in 1953. But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF  projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer. Question: How old was Audrey when she acted in Breakfast at Tiffany's? Options: A: 32. B: 25. C: 24. D: 15.

Sentence 2: SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost solely for power generating applications in urban areas. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entirely entailed by the first sentence, but it does share a significant similarity with it. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the differences and similarities between them. Sentence 1 states that \\"SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost entirely dedicated to power generating applications.\\" This sentence implies that the primary purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing is to support power generation, leaving little space for other applications. However, it does not specify any particular location or context where the power generating applications take place. Sentence 2, on the other hand, states that \\"SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost solely for power generating applications in urban areas.\\" This sentence adds a specific context—urban areas—to the claim made about the purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing. It narrows the scope of the statement in Sentence 1, suggesting that SCR catalyst manufacturing mostly caters to the power generation requirements of urban areas. The second sentence is to some extent entailed by the first one, as it maintains the focus on power generating applications being the primary purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing. However, the addition of the context \\"in urban areas\\" means there is more information in the second sentence that isn't required or implied by the first sentence. It introduces a slight difference in the claims made by each sentence.

Write an article based on this \\"Kem Ley, a prominent Cambodian political activist  and government critic, has been shot dead in the capital Phnom Penh.\\"","output":"Title: The Assassination of Kem Ley: A Dark Day in Cambodian Politics Introduction The assassination of Kem Ley, a well-known Cambodian political activist and government critic, on July 10, 2016, sparked waves of shock, disbelief, and anger throughout the country. With a deep commitment to social justice, democracy, and human rights, Kem Ley tirelessly advocated for a fairer and more equitable Cambodia for all. His tragic death in a gas station convenience store in Phnom Penh marked not only the loss of a revered figure but also a chilling reminder of the dangers faced by those who challenge the ruling political establishment. This article delves into the life and work of Kem Ley, the circumstances surrounding his brutal murder, and the legacy he leaves behind. Kem Ley: A Voice for the Voiceless Born on October 19, 1970, in Takeo province, Kem Ley began his career as a medical doctor, serving remote communities in need. It was during these years that he recognized the ubiquitous social and economic challenges facing Cambodians. Driven by a desire to bring about positive change, he shifted his focus to grassroots activism, establishing the Khmer for Khmer social and political advocacy group in 2013. Kem Ley was well-known for his keen intellect and his ability to analyze and articulate complex political issues with clarity. He regularly appeared in local and international media as a political commentator. In a climate of frequent defamation cases and journalist intimidation, Kem Ley was unafraid to criticize the ruling Cambodian People's Party's (CPP) policies and Prime Minister Hun Sen's increasingly authoritarian rule. The Assassination of Kem Ley On the morning of July 10, 2016, 45-year-old Kem Ley was shot in the head and chest by an assailant at the Caltex gas station convenience store in central Phnom Penh. He was declared dead soon after. The gunman, identified as Oueth Ang, was promptly apprehended and claimed to have killed Kem Ley over an unpaid debt of 3,000. However, given the victim's status as a prominent government critic, many Cambodians dismissed this motive as a cover-up for a politically motivated assassination. The murder was widely condemned by local and international organizations. The United Nations human rights office and Human Rights Watch called for an independent investigation into Kem Ley's death, expressing concerns over the government's ability to conduct an impartial inquiry. Despite these calls, Cambodia's judicial system, notorious for its lack of independence, handed the investigation and prosecution. In March 2017, Oueth Ang, who adopted the alias Chuor Samlab, meaning \\"Meet to Kill,\\" was found guilty of premeditated murder and illegal possession of a firearm by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Doubts persist about the thoroughness of the investigation, as many details, including the possible involvement of accomplices and masterminds, remain unexplored. The Legacy of Kem Ley In the wake of his assassination, thousands of mourners joined Kem Ley's funeral procession, which extended over 50 miles from Phnom Penh to his hometown in Takeo province. The overwhelming public outpouring of grief and support reinforced his status as a symbol of hope and defiance against the corrupt ruling elite. Kem Ley's murder had a profound chilling effect on Cambodian civil society, with many fearing the escalation of violence and intimidation against activists and journalists. Sadly, his assassination is not an isolated incident. The Cambodian Center for Human Rights documented 36 killings of human rights defenders between 1994 and 2016, with the vast majority of cases unresolved. However, Kem Ley's death also propelled a renewed determination among some Cambodian activists to continue the fight for democracy and justice in their country. His life and work serve as an ongoing inspiration to those who believe in the importance of free speech and political pluralism in a healthy society. Conclusion The assassination of Kem Ley marked a tragic and shocking moment in Cambodia's contemporary history. His bravery in speaking truth to power and unwavering dedication to the pursuit of social justice and democracy will forever echo in the hearts of those who share his vision. The national and international community must not remain silent about this horrific crime and the broader pattern of violence against dissidents in Cambodia. It is essential that those responsible for murdering such a courageous activist be brought to justice and that Cambodian society fights back against the wave of repression that stands in the way of progress and prosperity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Question: suppose there is less pollution happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"To analyze the connection between pollution and volcanic eruptions, let's break down the process step-by-step and examine if pollution has any effect on the different stages: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: The gases responsible for causing pressure beneath the earth's surface are mainly water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and others. Some of these gases, such as carbon dioxide, can be released due to human activities, but their contribution to the overall gas pressure in the earth's mantle is negligible compared to natural sources. So, there would be no effect of less pollution on this stage. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: This stage mainly depends on the pressure created by the gases and the magma's viscosity. Again, pollution produced by human activities doesn't have any significant influence on this stage. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 3. The magma cools: The cooling process of magma depends on the surrounding environment temperature and the heat transfer rate. While pollution could potentially have some impact on atmospheric temperatures, it doesn't significantly affect the underground environment where magma cools to form solid rock. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 4. With enough time the pressure builds up greatly: Pressure buildup is primarily influenced by the geological processes beneath the earth's surface, such as tectonic plate movements, and not pollution. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: Volcanic eruptions are driven by the internal pressure and geological processes that have little to no connection to the external factors, such as pollution. Based on this analysis, less pollution would have no effect on causing less or smaller volcanic eruptions, as the perturbation does not significantly influence any stage of the process mentioned above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted?  Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\".

Questions: When visiting a museum, what might a child experience? Options: - crowding - wonder - being bored - fear - sore feet Answer:","output":"When visiting a museum, a child might experience a range of emotions and sensations depending on their interests, the type of museum, and the exhibits on display. It is not unusual for a child to experience a combination of the options provided, but a detailed explanation of each option will be given to showcase how they may relate to a common museum visit for a child. 1. Crowding: Museums can often be busy places, especially during peak visiting hours or on weekends and holidays. A child may feel crowded if the museum has a high number of visitors, making it difficult to move around or get a good view of exhibits. This could potentially cause discomfort or frustration for the child. 2. Wonder: Museums are designed to inspire curiosity and wonder in visitors, especially children. It is common for children to be amazed by the artifacts, art, and information presented in a museum. Exhibits often showcase the marvels of human history or the natural world, and a child may find themselves in awe of the incredible discoveries they make. 3. Being Bored: While museums can be fascinating places, some children may not find them as engaging as others. This could be due to a lack of interest in the subject matter on display or the presentation style, which may not cater to a child's preferences. In such cases, a child may feel bored or disinterested during their museum visit. 4. Fear: Depending on the museum's content, a child may experience fear while visiting. For example, a natural history museum may have displays of large animal skeletons or replicas that may seem intimidating for young children. Similarly, exhibits that deal with dark or potentially frightening aspects of history may also cause fear. However, this experience might not be a common one for every child.  5. Sore Feet: A museum visit typically involves a lot of walking and standing, which could lead to sore feet, particularly for children who may not be used to longer periods of walking or standing in one place. This sensation, albeit a minor discomfort, can also negatively impact a child's overall museum experience. In conclusion, when visiting a museum, a child might experience any combination of crowding, wonder, being bored, fear, and sore feet. However, the predominant experiences will depend on the child's personality, interests, and the specific museum's content and environment. A well-planned museum visit, tailored to accommodate the child's interests and preferences, can help maximize the wonder and minimize potentially negative experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about FA Cup.","output":"What is the significance of the FA Cup in the English football landscape and how has it evolved over time? The Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is the oldest and most prestigious domestic knockout tournament in English football. The competition, organized by the Football Association (FA), was first held in the 1871-1872 season, and its significance in the English football landscape is both historical and cultural. The FA Cup's primary significance comes from its long-standing tradition and heritage. It has a unique charm and appeal, rooted in its rich history of over 150 years. The FA Cup has seen many memorable moments, with iconic matches, upsets, and Cinderella stories becoming ingrained in the sport's folklore. This extensive history has contributed to the competition becoming an integral part of English football culture and has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Another reason for its prominence is its inclusivity. The FA Cup is open to teams from all levels of English football, ranging from amateur and semi-professional clubs to the elite teams in the Premier League. This openness provides smaller clubs with the opportunity to compete against top-flight opposition and achieve dream runs, often leading to magical upsets that fans often remember for years. These so-called \\"giant-killings\\" showcase the unpredictable nature of football and are particularly endearing to neutral fans, exemplifying the spirit of the FA Cup. Additionally, the FA Cup serves as an avenue for clubs to secure a place in European competition. The winner of the cup is granted a spot in the group stages of the following season's UEFA Europa League. Not only does this provide financial benefits to the winning club, but it also offers prestige and respect within the football community. The format of the FA Cup has evolved over time to accommodate the increasing number of participating clubs and changing priorities in the football calendar. Initially, the competition featured a knockout format, with clubs being drawn randomly against each other in a winner-takes-all format. After a few years, replays were introduced to settle drawn matches, and these replays could continue until there was a winner. This system was slightly tweaked in recent editions to help reduce fixture congestion, with modern ties potentially being settled through extra time and penalties after the first replay. In the early years, the competition was dominated by amateur clubs, but with the rise of professionalism in English football, more prominent clubs started to assert their dominance. The tournament has seen numerous dynasties, with clubs such as Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool cementing their status as FA Cup giants through numerous successful campaigns. Despite the growing prominence of domestic leagues and the rise of continental club competitions, the FA Cup has retained its unique charm and importance within the English football landscape. Its long-standing tradition, the opportunity for smaller clubs to make history, and the unpredictability of the knockout format continue to captivate fans season after season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Thousands of cities around the globe turned off their lights for an hour to mark Earth Hour 2014, a symbolic show of support for the environment organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature.  Since the movement began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007, it has spread to more than 7,000 cities across more than 160 countries. Singapore continues to hold one of the world's largest lights-off events, drawing around 9,000 people this year to Marina Bay Sands, a commercial center typically awash in electricity.  To mark the event actors Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone and a group of other famous stars from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie were in town.  Other iconic landmarks that fell dark included the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok's Wat Arun temple, the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney Opera House, Red Square in Moscow, the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Hong Kong Harbor.       As the movement has grown, more organizations and business have committed to switching off their lights in support of efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. In Singapore, at least 600 organizations and companies agreed to either switch off their lights or participate in movements to use fewer plastic bags, take shorter showers, turn up their air-conditioning units or switch to LED lighting.  This year the World Wide Fund for Nature, which first launched worldwide Earth Hour, also launched Earth Hour Blue, a crowdfunding platform aimed at raising money for environmental projects around the globe. On Mar. 26 a project to stop the illegal wildlife trade in Asia by providing assistance to wildlife rangers became the first one to reach its target of 20,000 by relying completely on crowdfunding.

If \\"A group of people dancing with a hill in the background.\\", can we conclude \\"The group of people are standing on the Great Plains, where there are no hills in sight.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the group of people is standing on the Great Plains just because they have a hill in the background. There are several reasons for this and a few important factors to consider. 1. Global locations - Earth is filled with diverse landscapes and geographical features. There are many regions worldwide that have hills, mountains, and other terrain types. Furthermore, hills can also appear in the background of a dancing group of people even if they're not standing directly near the base of the hill. Thus, claiming that the group is standing on the Great Plains solely based on the presence of a hill in the background is not a valid conclusion. 2. Height and proximity of the hill - Not all hills are of the same size. Some hills may appear low, while others might be taller with a more imposing presence. The proximity of the hill to the group of people could also affect the hill's visibility in the background. In this scenario, the description doesn't provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the location of the group. 3. The perspective of the image or visualization - Depending on the vantage point and perspective of the image or the visualization of the group of people dancing with a hill in the background, the hill could appear closer or farther away, or it could be larger or smaller than it's in reality. Without more information, we cannot determine if the group is in the Great Plains or any other specific location. 4. The Great Plains and its geographical features - Although the description of the Great Plains often emphasizes the area's flatness, it doesn't mean there are no hills or other landscape variations in the region. The Great Plains stretch across multiple states in the United States and provinces in Canada, covering a vast area that includes both flat and hilly terrain. It's an overgeneralization to assume that there are no hills in the entirety of the Great Plains. 5. Other possibilities - There are many factors that could create the illusion of a hill in the background, such as shadows, elevations, and other visual elements. With limited information, it's crucial not to dismiss potential alternative possibilities. In conclusion, it's not possible to determine that the group of people is standing on the Great Plains solely based on a hill being present in the background. To make a claim with certainty, more information would be needed, such as additional details on the landscape, geographic coordinates, or a clearer representation of the surrounding area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola.  - Henry James \\"Red\\" Allen (January 7, 1908  April 17, 1967) was a jazz trumpeter and vocalist whose style has been claimed to be the first to fully incorporate the innovations of Louis Armstrong.  - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins.  - Ralph Edmund Stanley (February 25, 1927  June 23, 2016), also known as Dr. Ralph Stanley, was an American bluegrass artist, known for his distinctive singing and banjo playing. Stanley began playing music in 1946, originally with his brother Carter as part of The Stanley Brothers, and most often as the leader of his band, The Clinch Mountain Boys.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901  July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American trumpeter, composer, singer and occasional actor who was one of the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz.  - Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia, bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements.  - Don Wesley Reno (February 21, 1926  October 16, 1984) was an American bluegrass and country musician best known as a banjo player in partnership with Red Smiley, and later with guitarist Bill Harrell.  - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people.  - Jerome John \\"Jerry\\" Garcia (August 1, 1942  August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, best known for his work with the band the Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Though he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group.  - David Grisman (born March 23, 1945, in Hackensack, New Jersey) is an American bluegrass/newgrass mandolinist and composer of acoustic music. In the early 1990s, he started the Acoustic Disc record label to help spread acoustic and instrumental music.  - Franklin Delano Roosevelt Wakefield ( born June 26 , 1934 ) is an innovative American mandolin player in the bluegrass music style . Wakefield is known for his collaborations with a number of important and well - known bands , including Red Allen , Don Reno , Jerry Garcia , David Grisman , The Stanley Brothers , and the Greenbriar Boys .  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\".  - The Stanley Brothers were an American bluegrass duo made up of brothers Carter Stanley (1925-1966) and Ralph Stanley (1927-2016). Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo after Carter's death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016.  - American Roots Music is a 2001 multi-part documentary film that explores the historical roots of American Roots music through footage and performances by the creators of the movement: Folk, Country, Blues, Gospel, Bluegrass, and many others.  - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - An instrumental is a musical composition or recording without lyrics, or singing, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a Big Band setting. The music is primarily or exclusively produced by musical instruments. An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer herself will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in size from a duo or trio to a large Big Band, concert band or orchestra.  - Carter Glen Stanley (August 27, 1925  December 1, 1966) was a bluegrass music lead singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitar player. He formed \\"The Stanley Brothers and The Clinch Mountain Boys\\" band together with his brother Ralph. The Stanley Brothers are generally acknowledged as the first band after Bill Monroe & the Blue Grass Boys to play in the bluegrass genre. According to some historians, their recording of \\"Molly and Tenbrooks\\" (aka \\"The Racehorse Song\\") marked the beginning of bluegrass as a genre.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.

Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night.  and a hint : Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop.

Put it in a place with good circulation so it can dry completely. Drying it out will prevent bacteria from forming inside the loofah. Store your loofah on a hook outside of the shower.  Placing it near a vent or fan can also help it dry out quickly. Since many bathrooms stay humid, you might want to dry the loofah in a different room. You can run it through a hot wash cycle with your towels, run it through the dishwasher, microwave it for 30 seconds, or boil it in hot water for several minutes to kill any bacteria that might be growing. No matter what method you use, do it at least once a week to make sure the loofah stays healthy for use.  Dermatologists have recently found that loofahs tend to harbor more bacteria than previously thought. That's why it's important to sanitize your loofah often.  The same holds true for plastic bath poufs. Even though they aren't made from natural materials, they can still harbor bacteria. After this much time the loofah will be starting to fall apart from use and runs through the washer or boiling water. If you haven't been sanitizing your loofah, it's no longer safe for use after three weeks. Either way, time to get a new loofah.  Many people have recently switched to using washcloths, since they're easier to run through the washer and they last much longer than loofahs. If you decide to stick with loofahs, make sure you dry them properly after each use and replace them frequently to keep your body healthy. Summary:","output":"To keep your loofah clean and safe, wash it with hot water, dry it well, and sanitize it weekly, then replace it after three weeks or when it starts falling apart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Answer this question please: Which city experienced fewer rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Tree city experienced fewer rocks breaking. Reasoning: The text states that \\"almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries\\" and \\"when the stresses build too much, the rocks break.\\" In the given situation, Red city experienced many earthquakes, which indicates more stress built up and led to more rocks breaking in that area. In contrast, Tree city witnessed fewer and less frequent earthquakes, suggesting that less stress accumulated, resulting in fewer rocks breaking at that location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Apply this mixture to your boots using a stiff brush. Scrub vigorously to remove any dirt that is on your boots. If you do not have any leather bleach, use a leather cleaner to remove any dirt.  Take the time to thoroughly clean your boots. The more dirt you remove, the better the final outcome will be. Use circular motions as you scrub your boots. Once your boots are clean, you must remove the protective coating. Your boots were likely treated with some type of protective finish when they were initially dyed. A deglazer will remove this coating so the dye can be absorbed. To get the best results, you need to remove all of this before you apply the dye. Use a wet cloth or sponge to rub the deglazer all over your boots.  The finish and some of the color will come off when you apply the deglazer. You may want to do this outside because the fumes can be very strong. Use a white cloth or rag because you do not want the color from the rag to bleed onto your boots.  Use a toothbrush to get the areas between the sole and upper. Wait for the deglazer to evaporate. This usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Once your boots have dried, run a damp rag over your boots to make sure you that you have removed all the protective finish. If you still see some shiny areas on your boots, you need to deglaze them again.  Removing the protective finish is critical to a successful dye job. The dye will not penetrate your boots if the protective finish is still there. If you have to apply the deglazer multiple times, you may want to let your shoes dry overnight.

He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Write an article that answers the following question: When they did not have a prominent leader, what did they say it was?","output":"Title: The Absence of a Prominent Leader: Exploring Group Dynamics and Alternative Forms of Leadership Introduction Leadership is undeniably an essential component in various aspects of human life – from politics and business to social structures. A prominent leader often leads successful teams, organizations, and even entire nations as they can unify diverse groups, foster cooperation, and create visionaries for success. However, it's not uncommon for situations to arise where there is no clear-cut figure pushing the team forward. In scenarios where a traditional singular leader is absent, the dynamics can be quite interesting, and the challenges faced can be unique. The absence of a prominent leader often leaves groups to develop alternative forms of leadership to fill the void. Alternative Forms of Leadership 1. Shared Leadership In situations where no prominent leader is present, team members may resort to a shared leadership system. Shared leadership is a process where multiple team members assume the responsibility of leading and managing various aspects of the project, task, or group. This offers the advantage of pooling diverse skills and expertise, as everyone is encouraged to contribute their strengths and take on roles that suit them best. 2. Self-Leadership Another possibility in the absence of a prominent leader is for individuals to develop self-leadership, which is the ability to take personal responsibility for their work, motivation, and well-being. This form of leadership supports an environment where each team member is proactive, accountable, and acts independently to navigate through challenges and contribute effectively to group projects. 3. Emergent Leadership In cases where a traditional leader is absent, an emergent leader may arise from within the team. Emergent leaders are individuals who naturally assume a leadership role when the need arises. They may possess excellent interpersonal and problem-solving skills, or even just exhibit a strong work ethic that inspires others. However, unlike a formal leader, emergent leaders may not hold an official title or rank within the group. 4. Rotational Leadership Another form of leadership in the absence of a clear leader is adopting a rotational leadership system. This involves the rotation of leadership responsibilities among group members so that each person takes turns in assuming the role of the leader. This can foster an increased sense of ownership and accountability among team members, as well as encourage the development of leadership skills in everyone. The Dynamics of Groups Without a Prominent Leader The absence of a prominent leader can lead to a variety of outcomes, depending on the group's dynamics and the type of alternative leadership that emerges. Some possible outcomes include: 1. Increased Communication and Collaboration When there is no single leader to make decisions, group members may feel more inclined to discuss ideas and communicate openly to reach a consensus. This can foster a sense of collaboration, as people are more likely to listen to one another and value each other's opinions. 2. Creativity and Innovation The lack of a central figure dictating the direction, strategy, and decision-making can sometimes create an atmosphere that encourages creativity and exploration. Team members may feel empowered to suggest novel ideas and innovative approaches, without the fear of being shut down by an authority figure. 3. Potential Conflict and Disorganization On the other hand, the absence of a prominent leader can lead to power struggles, confusion, and disorganization within the group. Members may have differing opinions on how tasks should be executed, and without a single leader to steer them in the right direction, they may find it challenging to settle disputes or maintain a cohesive approach. Conclusion Regardless of whether a group has a prominent leader or not, the understanding and application of alternative leadership structures are essential to the successful functioning of any team. While the absence of a prominent leader may present unique challenges, it also offers opportunities for individuals to develop their leadership skills, contribute their strengths, and draw on the collective expertise of the entire group. The emergence of alternative forms of leadership can lead to increased collaboration, creativity, and innovation, ultimately paving the way for a resilient and dynamic team that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of today's world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cubans are travelling north, trying to reach the United States by land. They fear that with ties between Cuba and the US improving, the US could stop granting Cubans who reach the US by land the right to stay. Nicaragua accused Costa Rica of \\"hurling thousands of Cubans at Nicaragua's southern border posts\\". The Cubans said they had flown to Ecuador from where they had made their way north through Colombia and Panama to Costa Rica. They reported being stranded in Costa Rica after the trafficking ring which they had paid to get them to the US was broken up by the authorities. On Saturday, Costa Rica issued seven-day transit visas to more than 1,700 Cubans detained after crossing illegally into Costa Rica from Panama. Nicaragua's left-wing government, which has close ties to Cuba, said that move had \\"unleashed a humanitarian crisis with serious consequences for our region\\". The Cubans told Nicaraguan media they had waited for hours to be granted Nicaraguan transit permits before getting impatient and entering the Penas Blancas border post by force. They continued on foot on the Panamerican Highway north, where they were met by Nicaraguan security forces who took them back to Costa Rica. Some migrants said Nicaraguan security forces had fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez criticised Nicaragua's response. \\"When other countries take the irresponsible decision to close their borders, people will use any means to reach their destination,\\" he said. One Cuban migrant told Nicaraguan newspaper El Nuevo Diario that \\"most of us have been travelling for more than two months\\". \\"We're fleeing unemployment [in Cuba] and among this group, which started gathering in the past days in Costa Rica, are children and pregnant women,\\" the 50-year-old migrant said. Another migrant told Reuters news agency that \\"we don't want to stay in any of these countries, our aim is to reach the United States, that's our objective\\". The number of Cubans leaving the Communist-run island has risen since last December when Cuba and the US announced a thaw in their relations. Historically, Cubans reaching US soil have been given preferential treatment over migrants from other countries. Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, they can be granted asylum much more easily than applicants from other countries. But with relations between the former Cold War foes improving, many Cubans fear this policy, which dates back to the Cold War, could be abolished. According to US Customs and Border Protection figures, more than 25,000 Cubans entered the US through its southern border between October 2014 and September 2015. Summary:","output":"Cuban migrants attempt to reach the US by land, fearing that the US might stop granting them the right to stay due to improving relations with Cuba, causing a dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica over the handling of these migrants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Analyzing the sentiment This word, on its own, does not provide enough context to determine the sentiment. As a standalone term, \\"nonconformist\\" might have a neutral sentiment, as it merely describes a characteristic of a person or the movie without necessarily conveying if it is positive or negative. Step 3: Requesting further context To accurately determine the sentiment, additional contextual information from the movie review is needed.

Title: A Good Year Movie plot: In the prologue, a young Max Skinner, whose parents have died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's vineyard estate in Provence in south-eastern France. Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical yet very successful hard-working London-based bond trader with a sense of humour. Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving he almost knocks a local cafÃ© owner, Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible. To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week. On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless. In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Like Max, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu (\\"the lost corner\\") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics. Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her during dinner at the Duflot house. Max gets updates on office politics...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970), nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer. He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Context: Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.  Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event.  That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.  Mickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \\"majors monkey\\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014.  Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance.  In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii.  The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn.  Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.  After winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy.  Mickelson bogeyed the 16th hole of the final round. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole.  Needing a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than 50 yards (46 m). His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker. He was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey, and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18-hole playoff with Ogilvy.  After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: \\"I'm still in shock. I still can't believe I did that. This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won. Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play. I want to thank all the people that supported me. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry.\\" He was even more candid when he said: \\"I just can't believe I did that. I'm such an idiot.\\" Question: What happened to Phil in 2006? Answer:","output":"In 2006, Phil Mickelson experienced some ups and downs in his professional golf career. The most significant achievement for Mickelson that year was winning his second Masters Tournament, which gave him his third major championship title. He won this tournament by shooting a 3-under-par final round, finishing with a two-stroke lead over runner-up Tim Clark. His victory at the Masters in 2006 led him to be ranked 2nd in the Official World Golf Ranking, which was his career-best at that time. However, Mickelson also faced disappointment at the 2006 U.S. Open held at Winged Foot. Heading into the final round, he was the joint-leader, with an opportunity to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods in winning three consecutive major championships. Mickelson's aggressive playing style ultimately led to his downfall in the final round. He bogeyed the 16th hole and hit a wayward drive on the 18th hole, missing the fairway to the left and causing the ball to bounce off a corporate hospitality tent. Furthermore, instead of opting for a safe play, he decided to go for the green with his second shot, which hit a tree and did not advance much. Mickelson's subsequent shots landed him in a greenside bunker, and he was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey. This double bogey on the final hole cost him a chance of winning the championship outright or participating in an 18-hole playoff with eventual winner Geoff Ogilvy. After the tournament, Mickelson expressed his disappointment and shock in his post-tournament interviews, calling himself an \\"idiot\\" for his decision-making on the 18th hole. Despite the setback at the 2006 U.S. Open, Mickelson's victory at the Masters that year still marked a key highlight in his golf career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because Barnes and Noble is a popular bookstore chain, and employees working there would have access to various books and likely receive a discount on their purchases.  The neighbor's job at Barnes and Noble suggests that he might be more knowledgeable about books and might be more inclined to give a book as a gift. In addition, since the topic of owls is mentioned, it is plausible that the neighbor might think of a book that features owls, such as the Harry Potter series, which contains a famous owl character named Hedwig. The other choices are less common or less relevant when considering the neighbor's job. While giving sandpaper to help with the current project could be a thoughtful act, it does not directly relate to the neighbor's job at Barnes and Noble. The option of a new desk also seems less likely, as buying a new desk is a more significant purchase and is less connected to the neighbor's job at a bookstore.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

The user expresses their love for the G force episodes and their interest in the Gatchaman series without subtitles. However, they seem to have a negative opinion about the BOTP version due to the inclusion of characters like 7 Zark 7 and 1 Rover 1. Although the user appreciates the voice actors like Casey Kasem and Alan Young, they comment that the sound and animation quality could use an upgrade. Furthermore, the user states that they have collected the first few volumes, but would prefer to get dubbed titles of G force or Gatchaman instead. This preference suggests that they may not be entirely satisfied with the product as is and are seeking for an improved version.

Movie title: April Fool's Day Movie plot: On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her actress friend Torrance Caldwell. Present for a pre-festivities toast areâBlaine Cartier, Desiree's brother, who controls their joint inheritance (to Desiree's dislike), U.S. Senate candidate Peter Welling, Peter's \\"Miss Carolina\\" fiancee Barbie Reynolds, and the quintet's less wealthy videographer friend Ryan. With the party in full swing, Desiree's social nemesis and Ryan's not-so-secret crush Milan Hastings, arrives. Also present is chihuahua-toting society reporter Charles. As another in her long string of April Fool's pranks, Desiree suggests Blaine get Milan tipsy on champagne and seduce her in his bedroom upstairs. Desiree and several of the others hover by the cracked-open bedroom door, prepared to videotape the affair with the camera Desiree lifted from Ryan. However, Milan has a seizure and falls off the balcony to her death. The group goes to court, and Blaine loses control of the family's fortune, which shifts to Desiree, but they are considered innocent and Milan's death is considered a fatal prank. One year later, Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan receive anonymous invitations to meet on Milan's grave at noon, April 1, 2008, with the cryptic P.S. \\"I have proof.\\" Just after the entire sextet is back together, a messenger comes to the grave with a box containing a letter and a laptop computer. The letter says one of the six murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. As a show of intent, the computer has footage of Charles drowning in his pool. Everyone goes from the cemetery to the pool to confirm this mishap. Subsequently, an increasingly frantic Desiree sees one \\"suspect\\" after another \\"murdered\\" before her eyes (though the bodies keep disappearing). Barbie is electrocuted in a beauty pageant dressing room, Peter's campaign truck runs him down in a parking garage, Ryan's throat is slit in his humble apartment, and returning home, Desiree and Blaine... The answer is:","output":"The footage of Charles drowning in his pool serves as evidence and a show of intent by the anonymous threat-maker. The letter sent to Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan claims that one of the six people murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. The footage of Charles drowning is included on the laptop computer as a warning to the group, demonstrating that the threat is serious and not just another April Fool's prank. The party attendees, who all played a role in Milan's fatal prank a year before, receive anonymous invitations to gather at Milan's grave. It's there that a messenger delivers a box containing the letter and laptop computer. Once the group confirms Charles' death by visiting his pool, they are all in fear of their lives, especially Desiree, as she begins to witness her friends being \\"murdered\\" one by one. This creates a sense of urgency for the group to figure out who is responsible and confess in order to avoid the promised deaths by midnight. In conclusion, the footage of Charles drowning in his pool provides evidence of the anonymous threat-maker's deadly intentions, creating suspense and tension in the movie as the characters scramble to uncover their blackmailer's identity and avoid meeting a similar fate themselves."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Does the sentence \\"It emerged in Japan from stick gymnastics.\\" answer the question \\"Where did mens' rhythmic gymnastics develop from?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"It emerged in Japan from stick gymnastics.\\" partially answers the question \\"Where did mens' rhythmic gymnastics develop from?\\". It tells us that men's rhythmic gymnastics developed in Japan and originated from stick gymnastics, providing the geographical location and the root discipline. However, an extended and more comprehensive response can provide additional background information, deeper context, and emphasize the essence of the discipline. A more detailed and long answer would be: Men's rhythmic gymnastics, also known as Men's Group Gymnastics or Jika-tabi, originated in Japan in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The sport developed from a Japanese martial arts discipline called \\"stick gymnastics,\\" where participants perform various athletic movements, flows, and acrobatics using a wooden stick or a cane as a prop. Stick gymnastics itself traces its roots back to samurais' weapon training and also has fundamental connections to traditional Japanese theater, such as Kabuki and Noh. The idea behind the transformation of stick gymnastics into men's rhythmic gymnastics was to create a group gymnastics activity that integrates elements of artistic gymnastics, acrobatics, and dance. Men's rhythmic gymnastics focuses on the collaboration, synchronization, and harmony among team members when performing choreographed routines. It has evolved into a highly disciplined and aesthetically refined sport that emphasizes balance, flexibility, and strength. In men's rhythmic gymnastics, the competitors perform as a group, typically consisting of six members. These teams design routines that involve carefully synchronized movements, lifts, transitions, and balances, carried out to music. Performances in men's rhythmic gymnastics are characterized by impressive displays of agility, coordination, muscle control, and teamwork. Due to its prominent connection to Japanese culture and history, the sport is more popular in Japan than in other parts of the world. However, it has gradually gained recognition in countries like Finland and some Asian nations. In conclusion, men's rhythmic gymnastics is a discipline that stemmed from stick gymnastics in Japan, combining elements of artistic gymnastics, acrobatics, and dance. Focusing on group performance, synchronization, and harmony, it has evolved into a unique and fascinating sport appreciated by audiences around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: This article: The creation of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it is Long Valley Caldera. The caldera experienced a series of earthquakes, and it was the upward movement of magma below the caldera that was thought to be the cause of these earthquakes and uplift."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

English: The simply fact of the matter is that expensive products don't automatically equal quality products! Spanish:","output":"El simple hecho de la cuestión es que los productos caros no equivalen automáticamente a productos de calidad. En esta oración, el hablante expresa su opinión sobre un tema común en la sociedad de consumo. La oración destaca la idea de que, aunque a menudo se cree que los productos costosos son sinónimo de calidad, esto no siempre es cierto. Esta opinión se puede aplicar a una amplia variedad de productos y situaciones en la vida cotidiana. Para comprender mejor el significado de la oración, analicemos las partes clave del mensaje. Primero, \\"el simple hecho de la cuestión\\" pone un énfasis en la idea de que el hablante está hablando de algo fundamental y evidente. Esta expresión implica que, en realidad, la cuestión no es compleja y que la verdad es sencilla. La palabra \\"productos caros\\" se refiere a bienes o servicios que tienen un precio elevado, generalmente en comparación con otros artículos similares en el mercado. Las personas a menudo asocian los productos caros con una mejor calidad, durabilidad y, en algunos casos, un cierto estatus social. Sin embargo, en esta oración, el hablante cuestiona esta suposición. La palabra \\"productos de calidad\\" se refiere a bienes o servicios que tienen un alto nivel de rendimiento, durabilidad y cumplimiento con los estándares establecidos, independientemente de su precio. A menudo, los productos de calidad están respaldados por una buena garantía, un servicio al cliente receptivo y muchas opiniones positivas de otras personas que los han utilizado. Cuando el hablante dice \\"no equivalen automáticamente\\", está haciendo una declaración directa de que no existe una correlación directa e inmediata entre el precio y la calidad de un producto. El mensaje aquí es que es importante no dejarse engañar por la presunción de que un producto caro es siempre sinónimo de uno de calidad. Esta opinión es respaldada por la experiencia de muchas personas que han comprado productos caros y, más tarde, han descubierto que no cumplen con sus expectativas en términos de calidad y durabilidad. También es fundamental tener en cuenta que, en algunos casos, se paga más por la marca o el diseño, en lugar de por la propia calidad y funcionalidad del producto. En conclusión, la oración en español \\"El simple hecho de la cuestión es que los productos caros no equivalen automáticamente a productos de calidad\\" envía un mensaje claro sobre la relación entre el precio y la calidad de los productos. El hablante advierte a los consumidores que no deben asumir automáticamente que un producto caro es siempre un producto de calidad y, en cambio, deben investigar y evaluar cada producto en función de su rendimiento, durabilidad y cumplimiento con los estándares de calidad establecidos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – A Sarah Palin interview on the Today show Monday quickly got testy when the subject of PTSD and her son came up. After discussing Iowa for a few minutes, Savannah Guthrie changed the subject to Track Palin and his mother's recent comments about his domestic violence arrest. \\"You mentioned PTSD and you said that President Obama may be to blame for some of the PTSD that's out there,\\" said Guthrie. But Palin interjected, \\"I never said that, I never said that,\\" reports Politico. She elaborated: \\"I never blamed President Obama. What I have blamed President Obama in doing, though, is this level of disrespect for the United States military.\\" When Matt Lauer asked if Palin rejected the earlier comments, she shot back, \\"What did I say that's offensive? I don't regret any comment I made because I didn't lay PTSD at the foot of the president.\\" The comments in question came last month when Palin said military vets like Track \\"come back a bit different—they come back hardened,\\" and then added: “It's a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they're respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, 'Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we’re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us?'\\" Palin objected to the matter being brought up, but this Washington Post blogger thinks it's \\"fair game\\" because Palin is the one who raised it on the campaign trail.","output":"Sarah Palin and PTSD: A Contentious Topic on the Today Show Former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, made a memorable appearance on the Today show recently, where discussions regarding her son's arrest and PTSD quickly turned heated. The conversation began with the subject of the Iowa caucus but was swiftly diverted when co-host Savannah Guthrie questioned Palin about her recent comments regarding her son, Track Palin, and his struggles with PTSD. Track Palin, a veteran of the United States military, was arrested last month in connection with a domestic violence incident. His mother has since been vocal in attributing his violent actions to PTSD. In a public address, Sarah Palin spoke about how military veterans like her son often return from service with altered personalities and behaviors. \\"They come back a bit different—they come back hardened,\\" she stated. During the Today show interview, Guthrie asserted that Sarah Palin had previously hinted at President Obama being responsible for the PTSD experienced by veterans, such as her son. Palin, however, was quick to clarify her stance: \\"I never said that, I never said that,\\" she countered. Palin continued to state that she did not specifically blame President Obama for the prevalence of PTSD among military personnel. Rather, she attributed it to a \\"level of disrespect for the United States military\\" that she believes has arisen under his administration. Today show co-host Matt Lauer, not willing to let the issue rest, asked Palin if she would like to retract her earlier remarks regarding PTSD and President Obama. Palin remained resolute in her position, stating, \\"What did I say that's offensive? I don't regret any comment I made because I didn't lay PTSD at the foot of the president.\\" Palin's comments suggest that she believes the current administration has nurtured a culture of disregard for the sacrifices made by the nation's military personnel. She expressed her concern that military veterans now find themselves doubting the support and respect afforded to them by their government. Specifically, she questioned the understanding of the president when it comes to the experiences and challenges faced by veterans upon their return to civilian life. \\"('Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we’re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us?')\\" Palin said, addressing the uncertainty she feels arises from the president's actions and policies. The contentious topic of PTSD and its role in the plight of veterans like Track Palin has long been discussed on both the national and global stages. While many are sympathetic to those who struggle with the mental scars of combat, others argue that personal responsibility cannot be entirely overlooked in the wake of violent actions and behavior. While Sarah Palin objected to the matter being brought up during her Today show appearance, commentators have argued that it is \\"fair game\\" because it was Palin who initially voiced her opinions on PTSD on the campaign trail. The issue of PTSD, its connection to the actions of veterans like Track Palin, and the role of the current administration in addressing the mental health needs of military personnel, remain topics under heated debate in American society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

The fanbase is large and generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity), and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance. Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Schalke. The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes.

Question: Who wanted Alex to take his place and become the next sin-eater? Movie plot title: The Order Movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later). Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Order,\\" it is the sin-eater, William Eden, who wanted Alex Bernier to take his place and become the next sin-eater. Throughout the film, Alex unravels the mystery surrounding the death of Father Dominic and the existence of sin-eaters. As Alex grows increasingly disillusioned with the Church and his role as a priest, William sees potential in Alex to carry on the sin-eater legacy. William believes that Alex's disillusionment and knowledge about sin-eaters make him the ideal candidate to take over this secretive and heretical practice after he passes away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this: Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe. Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \\"Absolute\\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \\"monads\\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \\"substantial forms of being\\",elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony established by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism. According to Ward the universe is composed of \\"psychic monads\\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self- betterment.

Given the below context:  While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,...  Guess a valid title for it!

Why would this woman be willing to help the wayward kid ?","output":"This woman would be willing to help the wayward kid for a variety of reasons, primarily driven by her personal values, professional duties, and sense of empathy and compassion. As a member of society, it is natural for individuals to look out for one another, especially in instances where a vulnerable child is in need of assistance. The following factors may influence her willingness to help the child: 1. Personal values and morals: Her upbringing, culture, religion, or personal belief system might emphasize the importance of helping others, particularly in times of need. This woman may have a strong sense of responsibility towards the well-being of her community and those around her. She may believe that helping a lost child is not only the right thing to do, but is also an act that reflects her own character and morals. 2. Professional responsibility: As an employee at Wal-Mart, she is likely trained to assist customers in various situations, including when a child gets separated from their parents. Many stores and establishments have protocols in place to handle lost children to ensure their safety while they are on the premises. The woman's willingness to help may stem from her obligation to provide customer service and uphold the principles of her employer. 3. Empathy: The woman might genuinely feel compassionate towards the child, understanding that it must be very frightening for the young boy to be lost, separated from his family, and uncertain about what to do next. Empathy can create a strong emotional connection and drive individuals to help others experiencing distress. 4. Motherly instinct or personal experiences: The woman might be a mother herself or have other childcare experience, giving her a more profound understanding of the child's plight and a stronger inclination to help. Additionally, if she has ever experienced a similar situation either as a child who was once lost or as a parent who lost their child momentarily, she may remember the fear and anxiety and be more motivated to help other parents and children avoid that experience. 5. Sense of duty: She might have a strong sense of duty towards the welfare of others, especially children, who are often seen as more vulnerable and in need of protection. The woman may view it as her responsibility to help a child in need, no matter the specific circumstances. 6. Reciprocity: The woman may believe in the principle of reciprocity, meaning she would hope that if she were ever in a similar situation, someone else would be willing to help her or her loved ones. By assisting the lost child, she might be demonstrating her commitment to treating others the way she would want to be treated. All these factors contribute to the woman's willingness to help the wayward kid. In doing so, she is making a positive impact on the child's life, alleviating the fear and anxiety he may be experiencing, and ultimately, helping to reunite him with his family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Luca must find the strength to face his boss and the moral dilemma of his success as an artist — which ultimately stems from the dangerous world of Francois. In the thrilling climax, Luca confronts Francois in his gallery, only to find himself trapped in a perilous life-or-death situation. In a battle of wits and deception, Luca devises an ingenious plan to expose Francois and uncover the truth behind the art world's darkest secrets. He sets up a major exhibition featuring his paintings, all of which contain hidden details that expose the extent of the criminal network, which ultimately leads to the arrest of Francois and his accomplices. The film concludes with Luca returning to Italy and reestablishing himself as an artist of integrity as he starts over and reclaims his life, altered yet enriched by his harrowing Parisian journey. Through learning about the dark side of the art world, Luca discovers the importance of truth and integrity in his artwork and his life, leaving the audience to contemplate the value and cost of art, success, and personal ambition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  1996  for the following movie plot:  Oliver \\"Ollie\\" TrinkÃ© (Ben Affleck) is a powerful media publicist in New York City whose wife, Gertrude \\"Gertie\\" (Jennifer Lopez), dies during childbirth with an aneurysm in 1996. To avoid his grief, he buries himself in his work and ignores his new daughter, Gertie, while his father, Bart (George Carlin), takes a month off from work to care for her, but returns so that his son is forced to live up to his responsibility as a parent. Under the stress of a botched diaper change and a baby who will not stop crying, Ollie trashes his client Will Smith for his soon-to-be released film Independence Day in front of assembled reporters. The outburst costs him his job, so he moves in with his father in New Jersey. He eventually apologizes for ignoring his daughter, and attributes his public outburst to his grief. Blacklisted by all of New York City's public relations firms, Ollie has to work as a civil servant in the borough where he now lives with his father. Seven years later, in 2003, Gertie (Raquel Castro), now in elementary school, often coaxes him to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya (Liv Tyler), a graduate student and one of the store's clerks, whose uninhibited probing into Ollie's love life almost leads to their having casual sex. She soon becomes a part of their lives. As part of his job in the borough, Ollie speaks to a group of outraged citizens to win over their approval for a major public works project that will temporarily close a street in the neighborhood. His successful and enjoyable interaction with the crowd leads him to realize how much he misses the public relations work. He contacts Arthur (Jason Biggs), his one-time protÃ©gÃ©, who sets up a promising interview. The prospect of moving to New York creates tension among Ollie, Gertie, Bart, and Maya, especially when he says that his interview is on the same day as Gertie's school talent show. She yells at him, saying she hates him and that she wishes he had died instead of her mom. He claims he hates her right back, and says...

Here is a news article: Donald Sterling plans to still sue the NBA, according to a statement released by his attorney Monday.      \\"The action taken by [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans,\\" Sterling said through attorney Bobby Samini. \\"I have decided that I must fight to protect my rights. While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation of my rights to due process should not be trampled.\\"      While Sterling may be ready to continue to press his case against the NBA, including a 1-billion lawsuit he filed two weeks ago, his wife, Shelly, can also go to court in an attempt to clarify her right to control the team and its sale to Steve Ballmer for 2 billion.      Shelly Sterling had previously become the sole trustee after her lawyers sent a letter to Donald Sterling on May 29, informing him that she was in charge because of his inability to conduct business affairs.      While it is not required in the terms of the trust, Shelly Sterling could go to court to try to get a judge to validate her position. That would prevent another 11th-hour challenge from her husband.      In such a court action, Shelly Sterling would presumably bring forward the brain scans that her husband submitted to as well as reports written by the pair of neurologists.      People familiar with the bidding for the Clippers, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Donald Sterling's topsy-turvy behavior in regard to the sale also could be presented as evidence.      After signing a letter May 22 saying he gave his wife the right to negotiate a sale of the Clippers, including his 50% interest, Sterling later said he only meant for her to negotiate, not complete a deal.      Then, last week, Sterling sent signals that he was at peace with the transaction and would let it go through, even issuing a statement through Samini saying he would not continue his fight.      A different attorney for Donald Sterling later said that Sterling believed the NBA would drop its 2.5-million fine and lifetime ban against him, something the league said it never agreed to do. When Sterling learned that the fine and ban remained in place, his camp again gave combative signals.      Monday's statement from Samini was the latest sign that Donald Sterling was not ready to give up the team he has owned for 33 years. ||||| In a reversal, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling will pursue a 1 billion federal lawsuit against the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver, and withdraw his support for the sale of the team negotiated by his wife.      \\"I have decided that I must fight to protect my rights,\\" Sterling said Monday in a letter circulated widely among those involved in the sale and obtained by ESPN.com. \\"While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation of my rights to due process should not be trampled.\\"      Sterling's attorney Max Blecher earlier told ESPN.com in an email, \\"The deal is off.\\"      Sources told ESPN.com on Tuesday that Shelly Sterling and her lawyers intend to seek an emergency order from a California probate court Wednesday morning for an expedited hearing to resolve the situation with her estranged husband.      Last week, both Donald Sterling and Blecher indicated publicly that they would accept the record 2 billion sale to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In an interview with NBC4 during a charity function, Sterling said he was ready to \\"move on.\\"      However, Sterling has since changed course. Whether he will be successful in this new challenge remains to be seen.      \\"From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers,\\" he said in the letter. \\"I believe that Adam Silver acted in haste by illegally ordering the forced sale of the Clippers, banning me for life from the NBA and imposing the fine. Adam Silver's conduct in doing so without conducting any real investigation was wrong.      \\"The action taken by Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans.\\"      Blecher and another Sterling attorney, Bobby Samini, declined Monday to comment on whether the NBA's refusal to drop Sterling's lifetime ban and 2.5 million fine is the impetus for his change of heart.      \\"There was never a discussion involving the NBA in which we would modify Mr. Sterling's penalty in any way whatsoever,\\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. \\"Any suggestion otherwise is complete fabrication.\\"      The lawsuit alleges the league violated Sterling's constitutional rights by relying on information from an \\"illegal\\" recording that publicized racist remarks he made to a girlfriend. It also said the league committed a breach of contract by fining Sterling and that it violated antitrust laws by trying to force a sale.      Meanwhile, Shelly Sterling, Ballmer and the league remain confident the sale will proceed.      \\"Nobody doubts this thing will go through in the end. I guess it's just a matter of what mood Donald wakes up in tomorrow,\\" one source close to the situation said.      In an interview taped Sunday and released Monday, Silver told CNN that the league will be able to \\"take a deep breath\\" when the sale is complete.      \\"He's unsold his club several times over the years,\\" Silver said. \\"There's well-noted incidents in the league when he was right there at a closing and at the last minute decided not to sell. And until he signs that document, we still have a pending litigation with him.\\"      Shelly Sterling indemnified the NBA from damages in future lawsuits from her estranged husband as part of the sale agreement with the league. She negotiated the sale as the sole trustee of the Sterling family trust, which owns LA Clippers LLC, after two neurologists had declared Donald Sterling unable to conduct his own business and legal affairs.      The provisions of the family trust did not require a court order. To challenge her authority to conduct the sale, Donald Sterling would have to challenge her in California probate court, according to sources with knowledge of the situation.      Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling initially agreed to the sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for 2 billion, but later changed his mind and decided to pursue a 1 billion federal lawsuit against the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver.

Movie title: Kissing Jessica Stein Context: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother... The answer is:","output":"Jessica is in a relationship with Helen Cooper.

Information:  - Jesus , Interrupted : Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible ( And Why We Do n't Know About Them ) is a book by Bart D. Ehrman , a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . This work includes a narrative of Ehrman 's own progression in Biblical studies and beliefs , an overview of the issues raised by scholarly analysis of the Bible , details of a selection of findings from such analysis , and an exhortation regarding the importance of coming to understand the Bible more fully . Regarding the importance of Biblical study , Ehrman says in the preface , \`\` This kind of information is relevant not only to scholars like me , who devote their lives to serious research , but also to everyone who is interested in the Bible -- whether they personally consider themselves believers or not . In my opinion this really matters . Whether you are a believer -- fundamentalist , evangelical , moderate , liberal -- or a nonbeliever , the Bible is the most significant book in the history of our civilization . Coming to understand what it actually is , and is not , is one of the most important intellectual endeavors that anyone in our society can embark upon . '' One particular statement from early on appears to summarize the development of the subject matter that Ehrman attempts to cover in this volume : \`\` Scholars of the Bible have made significant progress in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years , building on archaeological discoveries , advances in our knowledge of the ancient Hebrew and Greek languages in which the book of Scripture were originally written , and deep and penetrating historical , literary , and textual analyses . '' Rich Barlow , of the Boston Globe , writes that \`\` he repeatedly stresses that historical - critical study need not kill faith . And , honest scholar that he is , he admits that some of his contentions can be challenged . ''  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books. Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a \\"critical edition\\" containing a scholarly curated text.  - Bart Denton Ehrman (born October 5, 1955) is an American professor and scholar, currently the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is one of North America's leading scholars in his field, having written and edited 30 books, including three college textbooks. He has also achieved acclaim at the popular level, authoring five \\"New York Times\\" bestsellers. Ehrman's work focuses on textual criticism of the New Testament, the historical Jesus, and the development of early Christianity.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Chapel Hill is a city in Orange County, North Carolina (with some eastern portions in Durham County), and the home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care. The population was 57,233 at the 2010 census; Chapel Hill is the 16th-largest municipality in North Carolina.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Early Christianity is the period of Christianity preceding the First Council of Nicaea in 325. It is typically divided into the Apostolic Age and the Ante-Nicene Period (from the Apostolic Age until Nicea).  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - The title of oldest public university in the United States is claimed by three universities: the University of Georgia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and The College of William and Mary. Each has a distinct basis for the claim, North Carolina being the first to graduate a class, Georgia being the first created by charter, and William & Mary having the oldest founding date of any currently public university, though it was private for over 250 years.  - The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, also known as UNC, or simply Carolina, is a public research university located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which also allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

Passage: The discography of South Korean-born Australian recording artist Dami Im consists of five studio albums, two extended plays, ten singles, two album appearances, and four music videos. Im began her music career as a gospel singer in Korea and independently released her debut studio album, Dream, in 2010. She was the winner on the fifth season of The X Factor Australia in 2013, and subsequently received a contract with Sony Music Australia. Im released her self-titled second studio album in November 2013, which features selected songs she performed as part of the top twelve on The X Factor. The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 copies.

Today, we are going to talk about some new ideas that people have for making the way courts work better and save a lot of money. You see, there are two different types of courts called the \\"Magistrates Court\\" and the \\"Crown Court.\\" These are places where people go if they have done something wrong, like taking something that does not belong to them or hurting someone. When people go to these courts, there are 12 people called the \\"jury\\" who listen to the story and help decide if the person did something wrong. But, having these juries can be expensive. Do you remember when we talked about money and how we need it to buy things, like toys and candy? Well, when a court works with the jury for just one day, it costs £900 in the Magistrates Court, and £3,000 in the Crown Court! People in charge have been thinking about how to save money, so they came up with a smart idea. They thought that maybe for some smaller wrong things people do, like taking without permission, getting into fights, or using things they shouldn't, maybe they could take the jury away.

After you've done a lot of cleaning, but you still have a lot to go, take a break. Good job.","output":"The most logical next event after taking a break from cleaning and organizing your house is to identify and prioritize the remaining tasks, then resume the cleaning process with a renewed focus and energy. 1. Evaluate the remaining tasks: Before jumping back into the cleaning and organizing process, take a few minutes to evaluate what tasks are left and prioritize them according to their importance. This will help you create a plan of action for effectively completing the remaining tasks. 2. Break tasks into manageable chunks: If you have a significant amount of cleaning left, it may seem overwhelming. Break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of trying to clean the entire kitchen at once, focus on one cupboard or drawer at a time. This will help you stay focused and make the process feel more manageable. 3. Set a timer: Having a timer can be a great way to stay focused and encouraged when cleaning. Set a timer for 20-30 minutes and try to complete your current task within the allotted time. Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break before jumping back into another task. 4. Declutter as you go: When organizing your house, you are likely to discover items that you no longer need, use, or want. Use this opportunity to declutter your living space by sorting these items into three categories: keep, donate, and discard. Keep only essential items, donate gently used items to charity, and discard items that are broken or no longer of use. 5. Organize items based on frequency of use and accessibility: As you go through your belongings and reorganize them, consider how often you use each item and arrange them accordingly. Items that are used daily or frequently should be placed in easily accessible locations, while items that are used less often can be stored in higher shelves or more out-of-the-way areas. 6. Maintain a clean environment: Once you've finished cleaning and organizing your house, it's essential to maintain an orderly space by regularly picking up after yourself and staying on top of your chores. Creating a cleaning schedule can help you continue to manage your home efficiently and ensure that it remains a comfortable environment. 7. Reward yourself: After completing the remaining tasks and admiring your clean and organized space, reward yourself for a job well done. You can do this by indulging in a favorite activity, treating yourself to a special meal, or simply enjoying some relaxation time in your refreshed and decluttered living space. By following these steps, you will not only continue to make progress in cleaning and organizing your house but also maintain a sense of accomplishment and motivation throughout the process."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This data can be considered when trying to establish the likelihood of Bela Lugosi being alive or dead. Step 2: Determine the birthdate of Bela Lugosi Bela Lugosi was born on October 20, 1882.  Step 3: Calculate Bela Lugosi's age at the time of the film The film was released in 1939, so Bela Lugosi would have been (1939 - 1882) = 57 years old at the time of the film's release. Step 4: Determine if Bela Lugosi's age and the current year (2022) exceed a human's average lifespan Adding 70 years to Lugosi's age at the time of the film release: 57 (Lugosi's age in 1939) + 70 (human's average lifespan) = 127 Step 5: Compare the result from step 4 to the current year Current year: 2022 As 2022 is much more recent than 127 years after 1939 (which would be 2066 based on the result from step 4), it is very likely that Bela Lugosi is no longer alive. Step 6: Look up Bela Lugosi's death A quick search reveals that Bela Lugosi passed away on August 16, 1956. Conclusion: Based on the average human lifespan, Bela Lugosi's age, and the confirmation of his death in 1956, it can be concluded that Bela Lugosi is dead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider all negative consequences.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Be Aware of Eavesdropping Laws: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding and Considering the Negative Consequences Introduction In today's highly connected world, access to information has never been easier. With the simplicity of a single click or a swipe on our devices, we open ourselves up to a vast array of digital information. Alongside this new age of technology comes the elevated threat of eavesdropping or spying on private conversations. Whether intentional or unintentional, eavesdropping puts the rights of both parties at risk, opening up the possibility for significant legal consequences. This article aims to provide you with a comprehensive guide to understanding eavesdropping laws and how to protect yourself and others from the negative consequences arising from it. So, before you engage in a casual conversation or decide to share sensitive information, ask yourself: \\"Am I aware of eavesdropping laws?\\" I. The Legal Landscape of Eavesdropping Eavesdropping laws vary significantly by country and jurisdiction, but the core principle is the protection of privacy rights and the prevention of unauthorized access to private conversations. These laws cover both oral and electronic communication, generally making it illegal to intercept, record or divulge conversations without the consent of at least one party involved. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to understand the specific legal implications of eavesdropping in their locality to avoid potential issues that may arise. a. United States In the U.S., eavesdropping laws are governed both at the federal and state level. The federal law, called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), protects wire, oral, and electronic communications during transmission by making it illegal to intercept or disclose the contents of such communications without permission.  States have different consent standards, falling under either \\"one-party consent\\" or \\"two-party/all-party consent\\" laws. One-party consent states allow recordings as long as one person in the conversation gives their consent. Two-party or all-party consent states, on the other hand, require all parties involved in the conversation to give consent to the recording. It is essential to understand your state's specific eavesdropping laws, as penalties for non-compliance can range from hefty fines to imprisonment. b. United Kingdom The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) regulates eavesdropping in the UK. Under this law, intercepting or recording private communications without the consent of all parties involved is illegal except for specific circumstances such as prevention of crime, protection of national security, or safeguarding public health. Failure to comply with the RIPA can result in criminal charges and possible imprisonment. c. Other Countries Laws and regulations on eavesdropping vary significantly around the world. In countries such as Canada, Australia, and Germany, for instance, it is generally illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved. Meanwhile, countries like Spain and Brazil follow a one-party consent approach. It is crucial to familiarize yourself with your country's eavesdropping laws to avoid any legal repercussions. II. Negative Consequences of Eavesdropping Not only does eavesdropping pose the risk of legal ramifications, but it can also lead to various negative consequences to both the eavesdropper and the individuals being spied upon. Some of these consequences include: a. Loss of Trust and Credibility An act of eavesdropping can significantly damage one's reputation and credibility. When eavesdropping is discovered, it erodes trust between parties and can create rifts in both personal and professional relationships. b. Emotional and Psychological Impact Eavesdropping invades an individual's privacy, leaving them feeling vulnerable and exposed. It can lead to feelings of paranoia, anxiety, and depression, especially if the person values their privacy highly. c. Business and Economic Impact In corporate settings, eavesdropping can pose risks to business operations. It can result in the loss of business secrets, intellectual property rights, or sensitive financial information. The uncertainty surrounding these situations can negatively affect stock prices, market share, and overall profitability. III. Protecting Yourself from Eavesdropping To minimize the risk of eavesdropping and its potential negative consequences, both individuals and organizations should consider the following precautions: a. Familiarize yourself with eavesdropping laws and ensure compliance with applicable regulations in your jurisdiction. b. Limit discussions of sensitive information to secure locations or encrypted communication channels. c. Regularly update and strengthen your digital security, such as upgrading passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and maintaining software patches. d. Be cautious of oversharing information or engaging in conversations in public spaces where eavesdropping may occur. e. In workplaces, create privacy policies and implement clear guidelines on handling sensitive information and recording conversations. Conclusion Awareness of eavesdropping laws and considering the possible negative consequences is an essential first step in protecting oneself and others from privacy violations. By understanding your jurisdiction's legal landscape and taking necessary precautions, you can minimize eavesdropping risks and safeguard the privacy of your communications. Always ask yourself, \\"Am I aware of eavesdropping laws,\\" and make informed decisions when engaging in private conversations or sharing sensitive information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses and the vindictive \\"other woman.\\" She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as \\"sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades.\\" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City. Context: In 1932, Tashman entered the hospital in New York City for an appendectomy that is now considered a concealment for abdominal cancer. She left the hospital thin and weak. Although she made five films in her last years, performing with her usual artistry and professionalism, she weakened significantly in the months following her hospitalization and her role in Riptide was trimmed because of her ever-worsening health.  In February 1934, she flew to New York City to film Frankie and Johnny for All Star Productions (released by Republic Pictures) but her condition necessitated a week of rest in Connecticut with Lowe. She resumed work in March, completing her film role on March 8 and then appearing at the Israel Orphan's Home benefit on March 10. When she entered the hospital for surgery on March 16, it was too late for the doctors to help her.  Tashman died of cancer at Doctor's Hospital in New York City on March 21, 1934 at the age of 37. Her funeral was held on March 22 in New York City synagogue Temple Emanu-El with Sophie Tucker, Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, Cecil Beaton, Jack Benny, and other distinguished celebrities in attendance. Eddie Cantor delivered the eulogy. The burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted 10,000 fans, mourners, and curious onlookers; it became a near riot when people were injured and a gravestone was toppled. Tashman left no will, but the distribution of her 31,000 in cash and 121,000 in furs and jewels provoked contentious discussion among her husband and sisters, Hattie and Jennie. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936 with her role as Nellie Bly cut to a cameo. Question: Was she buried there? Answer:","output":"Yes, Lilyan Tashman was buried at Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Her funeral had many famous celebrities in attendance, and her burial attracted a big crowd of 10,000 people, including fans, mourners, and curious onlookers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me break down each question to provide more context. 1. What are the theories of poverty? This question focuses on understanding the various explanations or theories that attempt to explain the existence and persistence of poverty. These theories help us examine the causes, distribution, and potential solutions for poverty in society. Some common theories of poverty include the cycle of poverty, structural factors, cultural factors, and more. 2. Is telepathy real? What is the process? This question consists of two parts: a) Is telepathy real? Here, the focus is on determining the existence of telepathy, which is the supposed communication of thoughts or ideas by means other than the known senses. This question challenges the scientific validity of telepathy as a phenomenon. b) What is the process? This part of the question seeks to understand the mechanism or process by which telepathy is believed to operate if it is considered real. It addresses the method of communication or transfer of thoughts between individuals without using conventional sensory channels. In summary, the first question is related to social and economic theories of poverty, while the second question delves into a paranormal phenomenon and its potential existence and operation.

FBI director James Comey wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday to inform it that the FBI would be looking at a number of previously undiscovered emails to see if they contain classified information. \\"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\\" NBC News quotes the letter as stating. The AP reports the new emails were not found on Clinton's private email server. They were found on devices belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner, according to the New York Times. They were found while the FBI investigates Weiner for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl. It's unclear what's in the new emails, the Los Angeles Times reports. Regardless, Comey says he wants the FBI to look into whether the emails contain classified information. In his letter, Comey admits that it's impossible to say whether the new emails will be important one way or another, Reuters reports. He also says he \\"cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.\\" According to CNBC, the stock market dropped as news of Comey's letter spread.

A special group called the FBI, whose job is to make sure everyone follows the rules, looked into the situation to see if Hillary had done anything wrong.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art? === The answer to the above question is Available choices: I. after viewing the ocean II. before the museum opens III. before work from ancient Rome IV. not enough information A:","output":"III. before work from ancient Rome"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the stock option par value vs. exercise price? What should I look for in the stock option agreement to know if my stock options can be exercised early (i.e. before they are fully vested)? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"[+] no; The questions you asked are not the same. Let me address each question individually to provide a clearer understanding. 1. Stock option par value vs. exercise price: Par value and exercise price are two distinct concepts related to stock options. - Par value: This is a nominal value given to a company's stock and is used to determine the minimum price at which the stock can be issued. Par value has little significance in today's modern markets, as most stocks have a very low or no par value. - Exercise price (also known as the strike price): This is the price at which a stock option holder can buy (in case of a call option) or sell (in case of a put option) the underlying stock. It is determined by the company when granting stock options, and generally, the exercise price is set at the fair market value of the company's stock on the grant date. 2. What to look for in the stock option agreement to know if your stock options can be exercised early: To find out if your stock options can be exercised early (before they are fully vested), you should look for the following provisions in your stock option agreement: - Vesting schedule: This specifies the timeline for when your options will become exercisable. Typically, options vest over a period of time, such as four years, with a one-year cliff. If your agreement allows for early exercise, it will be mentioned in the vesting schedule section. - Early exercise provision: Some stock option agreements include an \\"early exercise\\" provision, which allows you to exercise your options before they are fully vested. This can be beneficial in situations where you anticipate significant growth in the company's stock value. - Accelerated vesting provision: This is a clause that may allow for a faster vesting of your options under certain conditions, such as a change in control of the company or meeting specific performance goals. This is not exactly an early exercise provision but can impact the exercise timing. By reviewing these provisions in your stock option agreement, you can determine whether your options can be exercised early or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We went with a blue carpet instead of doing the hard wood floor, because the  Options are: --floor was cleaner. --carpet was cleaner.","output":"We went with a blue carpet instead of doing the hard wood floor, because the carpet was cleaner. This decision came after thorough comparisons and considerations, weighing the pros and cons of each flooring option. One of the main benefits of opting for a carpeted floor is the undeniable comfort it provides. Carpets are soft and warm underfoot, making them ideal for rooms where people will be walking around barefoot or children will be playing on the floor. The plush, thick fibers also create a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, opposed to the comparatively cold and hard touch of a hardwood floor. Additionally, noise reduction is a significant advantage of choosing a carpet over a hardwood floor. Carpets are excellent at absorbing sound, which helps to minimize the echoing and reverberation often associated with hardwood floors. This makes for a quieter and more serene environment, particularly when there are multiple people walking around or engaging in various activities within the same space. Another factor that led us to choose a blue carpet over the hardwood floor is the overall ease of maintenance and cleanliness. Carpets, contrary to popular belief, are actually easier to clean than hardwood floors, as long as they are well-maintained and taken care of. With a carpet, the daily chore of sweeping and mopping is no longer necessary, as a simple vacuuming will suffice. In our case, the blue color also helps in hiding minor stains and dirt, which would be more visible on a hardwood floor. Furthermore, carpeted floors offer enhanced safety, especially for families with young children or elderly people. Slipping accidents on hard surfaces such as hardwood floors can lead to severe injuries, whereas the friction from carpets provides a safer walking surface and can cushion falls to some extent. This extra layer of protection played a crucial role in our decision-making process. Finally, the aesthetics of the blue carpet were more appealing, complementing our interior design. While hardwood floors have a timeless appeal, their lack of customization options can make them feel generic and unexciting. On the other hand, the blue carpet added a unique touch of color and texture that matched well with our furniture and décor, creating a cohesive and stylish look. In conclusion, we went with a blue carpet instead of the hardwood floor because it offered significant advantages in terms of cleanliness, comfort, noise reduction, safety, and aesthetics. Ultimately, the blue carpet was the ideal choice for our space, meeting both our functional needs and design preferences."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Parent company Whirlpool said eight million affected dryers had been sold in the last 11 years, including five million in the UK. So far, 70,000 cases had been resolved. Other customers are facing a long wait for a visit. Some have reported an eight-week waiting list. \\"Given the large number of dryers affected, we currently have a wait time of many weeks before the repair service can be completed,\\" the company, which has 1,000 engineers, said. \\"This is not up to our high standard of service and we are working to address it.\\" More than three million people are being written to about the safety notice, with 1.8 million expected to receive letters in the next two to three weeks. Online checker Whirlpool bought manufacturer Indesit, including the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands, in October 2014. Investigations into reports of fires led eventually to the huge programme of alerts and repairs announced in November. The company is asking owners to check whether their machine is one of those affected and, if so, to contact the company through Hotpoint's dedicated website or the matching Indesit site. The model number, usually found on the back of the dryer door, can be entered in the online checker. If action is needed, an engineer will visit to mend the machine - a process that the company said could take an hour. Letters The company has written to 1.5 million customers so far, and expects to contact a further 1.8 million by the start of February. The company said a substantial number of the millions of dryers sold over the last 11 years would have been replaced or scrapped. So far, more than 625,000 customers have registered for a repair, the company said. With many facing a lengthy wait, the company said it was offering discounts on new products for those whose appliance was more than two years old. While waiting for a repair, owners are being advised not to use their dryer when they are out of the house or asleep, and to clean the filter after every cycle. Register warning Earlier this month, charity Electrical Safety First urged shoppers to register their electrical products with the manufacturer in order to receive details of any recalls. It said faulty appliances, in general, caused £41.6m of damage in the UK every year and 46 deaths were caused each year by electrical fires.

The view from Tim and Sheila Wilmot’s bedroom window is, frankly, rather astonishing. Palm trees as high as houses sway in the breeze, 15ft banana trees stand firm, Chinese windmill palms droop with huge clusters of green and purple seeds. There are enormous spiky agave plants, money trees the size of small bears, a 5ft bird of paradise. Scroll down for video. Jeepers creepers! Tim Wilmot, centre, is pictured surrounded by the exotic blooms of his garden in a suburb of Bristol - the product of decades' hard work. The air is sweet and hot and damp. You can hear water tinkling in the distance. All that’s missing is a troop of screaming monkeys swinging from liana to liana and a venomous snake or two. Vast ferns rustle in the shade - is that a tiger breaking cover? No, of course not. Don’t be so silly. Because Tim, 56, and Sheila, 60, don’t actually live anywhere near the Amazon rainforest, deep in the Congo or even in a particularly tropical spot of the Mediterranean. Home is a modern detached house in the sprawling commuter village of Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, 50 yards from a thundering bypass. Neighbouring gardens boast neatly clipped lawns, conservatories, rose beds and nylon washing lines. But Tim, who runs his own software company, prefers things a bit more tropical. ‘I don’t know why. It’s a good question. I’ve never lived in the tropics. I’ve never lived abroad. I wasn’t even particularly interested in gardening when I was growing up,’ he says. Ready for action: Tim poses above with a pair of garden shears. He spends hours every day tending to his array of plants, which hail from all over the world. Could you guess? From the front Tim Wilmot's home in Yate, not far from Bristol and yards from a thundering bypass - looks like any other home. ‘But 20 or 30 years ago we’d go on summer holidays and I’d spend all my time looking at jelly palms and Canary Island palms and think: “Wow! I’d love one of those in my garden. One day...” ’ The Wilmot family moved in when son Max, now 25, was still a baby, Toby, now 21, wasn’t even a glint in the eye and the garden was, well, just as you’d expect a suburban garden to be. Nice big patio, beech hedge, leylandii, apple trees, decent stretch of grass, a bright orange Ronsealed fence, ornamental pagoda and not a banana tree or shrieking chimpanzee in sight. ‘It was fine for a bit. But no one else in the family is into gardening, so I just sort of started doing my own thing. I didn’t ask permission,’ says Tim. He is a self-taught amateur gardener. But, bit by bit, with the help of gardening books, information from the internet and trial and error, he transformed this quarter of an acre into looking like a painting by Henri Rousseau. Down came the beech hedge and the apple trees and the pagoda. The leylandii were ripped up and replaced with a bamboo plantation. In went jelly palms from South America, banana trees, ferns, ornamental cacti, yuccas, succulents, gunneras (which looks a bit like monster prehistoric spiky rhubarb) and rice paper plants. ‘I had a few tropical plants in our last garden, but they were all in pots and just waiting to be let loose.’ Once unleashed, they must have gone mad. Because today everything is massive, enormous, jungle-sized. The banana leaves are like sails. The foliage of the gunnera measures six foot across. The rice paper plant leaves are the size of coffee tables. Hours' work: Tim spends more than two hours every day watering his garden during dry spells - and has luckily never been hit by a hose-pipe ban. Despite his modesty, maintaining a jungle garden on the outskirts of Bristol isn’t simply a combination of gentle pruning and swinging like Tarzan through the foliage. ‘It’d be easier in London or down in the South-West - we’re in a frost pocket here.’ So during winter, Tim spends hours hunched over his own weather station checking for cold snaps and high winds, erecting vast home-made polytunnels made of curved drainpipes and polythene over his prized agaves (from sunny Mexico) and lovingly wrapping his tender palms and bananas in horticultural fleece. ‘I get very twitchy when it’s cold. I’ll be out there at three in the morning in my dressing gown, putting extra layers of fleece on.’ He also spreads ten bales of straw round the bases of the banana plants, builds plant shelters and decants the pot plants into a purpose-built greenhouse. This sounds a breeze, until you remember that many are 10ft and weigh half-a-ton each. ‘It takes three days with the help of Max to get them all in. They hate the cold, so I have a fan heater going to keep the temperature above three or four degrees.’ Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time. Then, come spring, he has to reverse the whole process, hoping and praying no lasting damage has been done. ‘It’s only in the spring you can tell if the palm trees are OK. They’re still green, but the central spear will go mushy and collapse. It’s very sad. ‘I have vision of how it should all look and then I end up with a blank spot in the garden. I’m very critical and I want everything to be perfect.’ Does Sheila get irritated, what with him buzzing in and out all night in his pyjamas, fussing over the palms? ‘Yes. I tend to get a bit engrossed and everything I do in the garden takes twice as long as I tell her it will. ‘But I think she minds more in the summer, when we could be going out for the evening and I’m busy watering.’ And watering, and watering. During a dry spell, he’ll spend at least two hours a night watering. ‘You could put a hose-pipe on a banana all day and they’d lap it up. They could live in water.’ Perfectionist: Tim admits to spending hours more than planed in his garden - and has reached the point where it is so full there is no extra room unless something dies. Happily, the Wilmots’ house was built in 1988, just before water meters were introduced. But what about hose-pipe bans? ‘We’ve never had a hose-pipe ban here, only a sprinkler ban. But I’ve got a well and a pump for emergencies.’ Over the years, there have been disasters - ‘I’ve had terrible losses with my tender palms’ - and triumphs. ‘It’s a very big moment when one of the banana trees produces a banana - you can’t eat them, of course. They’re small and there’s no flesh in them. But the flower! Ah, it’s a Triffid-like flower. It’s very exciting.’ Tim’s garden has won endless prizes, been featured in magazines and BBC TV’s Gardeners’ World and is open to the public every year as part of the National Gardens Scheme (the next open day is Sunday, September 14). And today, finally, after 25 years of hard work, it is finished. ‘It’s done, it’s full. To be honest, it’s a bit of a relief. I can’t fit anything else in, so it’s a one-in-one-out system when something dies.’ And, rude question, but what about the cost of it all? Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months. Exotic: The puya plant, pictured, originally comes from the mountainous Andres, but can survive in Bristol. Vibrant: Mr WIlmot's plants, such as this golden bamboo, are usually found thousands of miles away. ‘People always go on and on about the money, but I don’t think it’s that much - £10,000 altogether. You could spend that on a golf club subscription. It’s a hobby and it’s exercise, so it’s good value for money. And all my family get to enjoy it, too. We even had the sitting room windows made bigger so we could all see it better.’ But what if they ever move? ‘I’ll have to leave the plants behind. Maybe I’d donate some to Kew Gardens for their hot house.’ The garden would not appeal to everyone. Today there’s just teeny scrap of lawn left. Barely space for a washing line. The tropical plants dominates totally and utterly. But it is magnificent. The views from the house are extraordinary. Sit on their sofa and it really feels as if you’re in a jungle. The only thing missing is colour. ‘There’s loads of colour! It’s all colour!’ he says, outraged. But it’s all green. What about flowers? A rose or two or clematis? Tim shudders. ‘I see no attraction in roses or clematis. None whatsoever. They get diseases, they need lots of attention and everyone else is growing them. What’s the point?’ And what about the neighbours? ‘They don’t seem to be that into gardening. But I have noticed the odd bamboo springing up. And more palm trees. ‘Maybe it’ll catch on and in 30 years this whole area will be one big jungle.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article describes the astonishing transformation of Tim and Sheila Wilmot's garden in Yate, a commuter village on the outskirts of Bristol, England. Although their home is situated 50 yards from a busy bypass, their garden features palm trees as high as houses, 15-ft banana trees, Chinese windmill palms, agave plants, and money trees. Tim, a self-taught gardener, has spent 25 years creating this tropical paradise, tending to it with great care. Their garden has won numerous prizes and has been featured on BBC TV's Gardeners' World."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Faith No More (sometimes abbreviated as FNM) is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. Before settling on their current name in 1982, the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest remaining members of the band, having been involved with Faith No More since its inception. Faith No More displayed an even more experimental effort on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is \\"one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label\\" and another writes that the single \\"'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers (...) reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.\\"  Aside from \\"A Small Victory\\" (which received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards), the tracks \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"Everything's Ruined\\" were also released as singles. The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy, and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores \\"Easy\\", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as The Real Thing in the US, sold 665,000 copies there, and managed to outsell The Real Thing in many other countries. In Germany, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies. The album also matched the sales of The Real Thing in Canada (Platinum), Australia (Gold), and surpassed it in the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the UK. Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies.  After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1993, long-time guitarist Jim Martin left the band due to internal conflicts. He was reportedly unhappy with the band's change in musical direction on Angel Dust, describing it as \\"gay disco\\". According to Roddy Bottum, Martin was fired via fax. However, Martin himself states it was his decision to leave. Both Godflesh guitarist Justin Broadrick and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker were reportedly offered to join Faith No More after Martin's departure, but declined to join. The position was filled by Mike Patton's bandmate from Mr. Bungle, Trey Spruance, who left soon after recording 1995's King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime and just before the band was to begin their world tour. Spruance was replaced by Dean Menta, the band's keyboard tech. what type of music does the band make?","output":"Faith No More is an American rock band known for their experimental and genre-blending music style. They incorporate elements from various genres such as metal, punk, funk, progressive rock, and alternative rock, making it difficult to categorize their music into a specific genre. Their eclectic approach has led to a unique and original sound which sets them apart from other rock bands."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to \\"raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world\\". He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy. An avid listener of Gospel music, he attends the Fellowship of Faith Church when he is back home in Atlanta and is involved and active with the youth programs at the church. Together with his parents, Howard also established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. The Foundation provides scholarships for students who want to attend his alma mater, Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, and grants to Lovell Elementary School and Memorial Middle School in Orlando, Florida. The Foundation also organizes summer basketball camps for boys and girls, and together with high school and college coaches and players, fellow NBA players are invited to be on hand at the camp. For his contributions in the Central Florida community, Howard received in 2005 the Rich and Helen De Vos Community Enrichment Award. Within the NBA itself, Howard has participated in several NBA \\"Read to Achieve\\" assemblies encouraging children to make reading a priority. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work. In 2009, Howard, along with several other NBA players, joined the Hoops for St. Jude charity program benefitting the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Elsewhere, Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. He made another appearance on the show in the October 9, 2011 episode.  Along with Sam Worthington and Jonah Hill, Howard appeared in a commercial for the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.  Howard, along with Carmelo Anthony and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.  In 2014, Epix featured Howard as the focal point of a documentary about his life called In the Moment. The film was directed by Ross Greenburg and Executive Producers include Michael D.

Process:  - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer trees happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if there were fewer trees available, it would potentially affect the construction of more or larger bird nests. This hypothesis could result in a few direct and indirect effects on the bird nesting process: 1. Limited nesting sites: With fewer trees, there would be limited nesting sites for birds, leading to increased competition among them. Birds that usually construct larger nests might have to opt for smaller ones or pick less suitable trees to accommodate their nests. 2. Limited construction materials: A decrease in the number of trees would also lead to a reduction in the available twigs and other materials used for nest construction. Birds might have to compromise their nest structure and stability by utilizing alternative or less preferred materials to build their nests. 3. Effect on bird populations: As larger or more nests are affected by the lack of trees, the overall bird population could be indirectly impacted. This is because a decrease in available nesting resources might lead to a reduction in reproductive success and lower their populations in the long run. 4. Altered nesting behavior: Birds might adjust their nesting behaviors in response to a diminished number of trees. For example, they might switch to building nests on the ground, different structures, or in the remaining trees in more densely packed congregations, resulting in altered bird distribution patterns and social behaviors. 5. Effects on other species and ecosystems: The shortage of trees and its effect on bird nests might also have indirect effects on other species. As birds adjust their behaviors, they might interact more with predators, parasites, or competitors, affecting overall ecosystem health and structure. In conclusion, the perturbation of having fewer trees would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the construction of more or larger bird nests. The altered availability of nesting sites and materials could lead to changes in nesting behavior, bird populations, and broader ecosystem dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, disputations and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions. The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna. Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a \\"self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars\\" and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were \\"founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What types of subjects did the universities of Bolonga focus on?","output":"The University of Bologna, located in Italy, is one of the oldest universities in the world and played a significant role in shaping the development of Italian and Southern European university culture.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person whose competent performance persuaded others their problems were in the past? from the following article ?  In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize.

This event holds significant importance in modern history, as it led to major global changes in security, foreign policy, and approaches to fighting terrorism. It appears that the narrator has a personal connection or a strong emotional attachment to the event and its significance. Their custom to spend time reflecting in the morning, particularly on this anniversary, demonstrates their desire to honor the memory of those who lost their lives and the profound impact this tragedy had on the world. Mentioning the beautiful day in NYC, the amazing sky, and the beautiful sunlight paints a vivid picture, and the contrast between the seemingly normal and picturesque morning and the devastating events that unfolded later that day can also serve as a reminder of the unpredictability of life. Remembering 9/11 has become an annual tradition for many in the United States and around the world. The devastating loss of life and the lasting effects on those who survived have made the event a somber and poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of unity and resilience in the face of adversity. Commemorations range from moments of silence, memorial services, and the sharing of personal stories to educational programs and discussions for better understanding and learning from the event. In summary, the narrator is commemorating the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, a pivotal and tragic event in recent history that has had profound and lasting effects on both personal and global levels.

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \\"Condorman\\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \\"The Bear\\". Woody refuses to do the job, but when Russ reveals that \\"The Bear\\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich.

Q: Context: The role of the adipokine, resistin in mediating increases in aortic stiffness is uncertain. We aimed to determine independent relations between circulating resistin concentrations and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and wave reflection in a community-based sample with a high prevalence of untreated hypertension and obesity.', 'Plasma resistin, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein concentrations (ELISA); carotid-femoral (aortic) PWV and the aortic reflected wave index (applanation tonometry and SphygmoCor software) were determined in 683 randomly selected participants of African ancestry from SOWETO, South Africa who had never received antihypertensive therapy.', 'Resistin concentrations were not independently associated with office or 24-h (nu200a=u200a492) blood pressure (BP). In a stepwise regression model with BMI included in the model, age (Pu200a<u200a0.0001), mean arterial pressure (Pu200a<u200a0.0001), plasma resistin concentrations (Pu200a<u200a0.005), female sex (Pu200a=u200a0.01), and creatinine concentrations (Pu200a<u200a0.01) contributed independently to variations in PWV. Independent relations between resistin concentrations and PWV persisted with further adjustments for C-reactive protein concentrations (Pu200a<u200a0.005), and the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (Pu200a<u200a0.02). Similar relations were noted with waist circumference rather than BMI in the model. Resistin concentrations were not independently associated with aortic reflected wave index or aortic BP. Answer: Resistin is independently and directly associated with aortic stiffness and these effects occur beyond BP, insulin resistance, and general inflammation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It can be difficult to focus on your online course if you have a social media account open in another tab or are receiving notifications on your computer. When you’re doing classwork, avoid browsing the Internet, checking your email, and other distractions. If necessary, you can install an app that will restrict your access to certain websites during a designated period of time so you can focus on your studies. Never go into a study session undirected. Have specific goals each time you sit down to study. You can break the material up into chunks and study one chunk at a time. Make a schedule for yourself, with individual study sessions divided by topic. You should also remember your overall academic goals when you study. This can help with your motivation. Think about how a good grade will contribute to your overall GPA. Think about how the material will benefit you after the course. Simple memorization can only go so far. One of the most effective means to memorize material is giving yourself tests and quizzes. Quizzing can improve memorization because of a process called \\"retrieval.\\" Every time a memory is retrieved, it becomes more accessible in the future. If there are practice tests and quizzes available online, take as many as you can. You can also make up tests and quizzes for yourself.  Flashcards can be a great way to test yourself on things like vocabulary and dates. You can also write down potential exam questions as you study. This can be very helpful if you're expecting an essay test. After you finish studying, take the test you made for yourself. Studying for long hours can easily lead to burnout. It's important to take breaks as you study. Take a break about every hour or so. Do something fun, like watch TV for a few minutes or go for a brief walk, and then return to your materials. You will find yourself feeling refreshed and recharged after a quick break. Remember, your instructor in an online course is a valuable resource. Just because you don't see them every day does not mean you can't reach out to them. If you stumble across anything confusing while studying, do not hesitate to send your instructor an email asking for clarification. If you have a web camera, try setting up a video chat meeting with your instructor for face-to-face feedback.","output":"The article provides tips for effective online learning, covering focusing on studies by avoiding distractions, setting specific goals, using quizzes and flashcards for memorization, taking breaks to prevent burnout, and utilizing instructors as a resource for clarification and guidance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why: 1. Michigan: While it is a state in the United States, it does not specify a particular place where one could buy a harp. It is a more general location rather than a specific destination for purchasing musical instruments. 2. Concert hall: A concert hall is a venue where concerts and musical performances take place. While one might see or hear harps in concert halls, concert halls do not typically sell musical instruments such as harps. 3. Irish bar: An Irish bar is primarily a liquor-serving establishment that may feature live traditional Irish music. It is not a place where one would go to buy a harp or other musical instruments. 4. Create music: \\"Create music\\" refers to the process or act of composing, playing, or making music, rather than a place to purchase a harp. 5. Music shop: A music shop is a store that specializes in selling musical instruments, accessories, and sometimes sheet music. It is the most appropriate place among the given options for purchasing a harp because they have a selection of instruments and knowledgeable staff who can help guide the buyer. In conclusion, a music shop would be the best choice because it is designed and intended for the purpose of selling musical instruments, including harps.

Therefore, batteries could not be inserted and product was useless. Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review in question can be classified as a negative review. The reasons for deeming it as negative can be analyzed through several aspects that the reviewer pointed out, which can be summarized and elaborated as follows: 1. Poor Design: The reviewer starts off by mentioning that the design of the product is flawed, which already sets a negative tone. A well-designed product should cater to the needs and expectations of users, but, in this case, they were not met. 2. Battery Compartment Issues: The main complaint expressed by the reviewer is that the battery compartment is too short for the batteries. This is a significant design problem, as it directly impacts the product's functionality. Users expect products to work seamlessly, particularly when it comes to something as essential as a battery compartment. However, this issue prevented the reviewer from using the product as intended. 3. Inability to Insert Batteries: As a consequence of the too-short battery compartment, the reviewer could not insert the batteries. Batteries usually serve as a primary source of power for electronic products, so without them functioning correctly, the product becomes useless. This presents a major inconvenience for the user and contributes to the negative sentiment of the review. 4. Product Uselessness: Due to the complication with the battery compartment and the inability to insert batteries, the reviewer found the product unusable. A product's primary purpose is to serve its intended function, but, in this instance, it failed to do so. This further solidifies the negative tone of the review, as customers rarely appreciate products that they cannot use. 5. Product Return: Finally, the reviewer mentions that they had to return the product, which indicates a strong level of dissatisfaction. Returning a product is usually a last resort when the user encounters insurmountable issues with it. It can be inferred that the customer was extremely dissatisfied with the design and functionality of the product, leading to the return. Taking into account all of these points, it becomes clear that the review is negative. The customer experienced several problems with the product, suffered from its poor design, and ultimately found it useless. This negative review reflects the overall sentiment that the product did not meet user expectations and, therefore, is not recommended for others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Options:  A. politicians stripped him of his civil rights.  B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier.  C. not enough information  D. he became a convicted felon.  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One night they are intrigued by a young man who bursts into the brothel and is immediately tended to after snapping his fingers, despite the brothelkeeper's objections. The gentlemen are informed that he is Courtley, who was disinherited for celebrating a Black Mass. Hoping for more intense pleasures, Hargood meets Courtley outside the brothel. The younger man takes the three to the Cafe Royal and promises them experiences they will never forget but insists that they go to see Weller and purchase from him Dracula's ring, cloak and dried blood. Having done so, the three meet with Courtley at an abandoned Church for a ceremony during which he puts the dried blood into goblets and mixes it with drops of his own blood, telling the men to drink. They refuse, so he drinks the blood himself, screams and falls to the ground. As he grabs their legs, they kick and beat him, not stopping until Courtley dies, at which they flee. While the three return to their respective homes and return to their lives, Courtley's body, left in the abandoned church, transforms into Dracula, who vows that those who have destroyed his servant will be destroyed. Dracula begins his revenge with Hargood, who has begun to drink heavily and also treats his daughter Alice harshly, furious that she continues to see Paul, Paxton's son.

Sarah could not get the jasmine to fit in the pot because the","output":"roots had grown far too large for its current container. Her love for gardening had blossomed just as unexpectedly as her flowers. It all started a year ago when a close friend gifted her a small jasmine plant to brighten up her new apartment. Sarah, never having taken care of plants before, approached the task with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. However, as the days went by and she devoted more time and care to the fragile being, she discovered an inexplicable connection to it.  The soothing fragrance of the jasmine flowers filled her small living space, becoming a source of comfort during the long days that meshed into one seemingly never-ending week while working from home. COVID-19 had changed so many aspects of her life; friends and colleagues becoming mere pixelated faces on a screen, routines disrupted, and once familiar places inhabited by the eerie silence of a pandemic-riddled world.  Feeling isolated within the confines of her apartment walls, Sarah began seeking connections with the living in a different way. Gardening channels on YouTube, books about plants, blogs on caring for flora – every waking moment spent outside her work life was dedicated to learning more about these quiet beings. Beside the jasmine plant, her apartment was now home to an army of plants. Echeverias adorned the windowsill along with aloe-veras, spider plants held residence on various shelves, and a majestic monstera had its claim on an entire corner. Today though, the jasmine was proving a difficult challenge. Overcome with determination, Sarah decided to enlist the help of the online gardening community. She snapped a photo of the stubborn plant and, with accompanying queries, posted it to her favorite gardening forum. Within moments, her phone screen filled with notifications of replies offering advice. One solution stood out: \\"try the technique of air layering,\\" it read. Intrigued, Sarah researched further and discovered that air layering meant rooting a stem while it was still attached to the parent plant to promote root development before transplanting it into another soil container. Gathering the necessary materials, Sarah carefully followed the instructions for air layering: she dampened some sphagnum moss, made an upward cut into the jasmine's stem, stuck a toothpick in the cut to hold it open and then wrapped the moistened moss around it. She secured the moss with a piece of plastic wrap and some gardening tape. Now, all there was left to do was wait. Over the following weeks, Sarah continued to nurture her plants, all while meticulously checking on the progress of her jasmine's air-layered stem. Gradually, the stem began to develop its own root system, and Sarah beamed with pride at the success of her first attempt at a somewhat advanced gardening technique. Finally, after a month, she decided it was time to separate the stem from the parent plant. Sarah carefully removed the plastic wrap and moss from the stem, revealing a healthy cluster of roots. With a heavy heart, she cut the stem from its connection to the parent jasmine and carefully placed it in a new, larger pot, filled with nutrient-rich soil. Tending to her plants, Sarah felt her isolation ebbed away by the comforting presence of these diverse, living beings. As the jasmine flourished in its larger pot, so did Sarah's understanding of the delicate balance between growth and change. For Sarah, gardening was not just a hobby or a means to bring color to her home; it had become a profound metaphor for life itself, reminding her of the importance of care, connection, and adaptability. And so, the story of Sarah and her jasmine continued, their intertwined existence growing stronger day by day, defying the challenges and uncertainties of the world outside. Together, they were blossoming in a world that desperately needed a reminder of nature's resilience and beauty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you're wearing pants or a skirt with a tight waistband, your clothes could be making matters worse by putting pressure on your bladder. Make yourself as comfortable as possible by loosening your tight clothing.  If you're wearing a belt, unbuckle it. Unbutton or unzip your pants or skirt. To hide the fact that you're unbuttoned, pull your shirt down or place a sweater or another item over your lap. For similar reasons, you may also find it helpful to uncross your legs, particularly when sitting. Squirming around jostles your bladder and creates an urge that feels more extreme. You might want feel like tapping your feet or shifting from side to side, but that's just going to make matters worse. Try to get in a comfortable position and stay that way. This is one of the best ways to deal with having to pee on a bus. If there's really nowhere to go to the bathroom for the next hour or two, make the best of the situation by trying to forget about your uncomfortable physical state. Pick up your reading material or turn on a video absorbing enough to keep your mind off of your urge to relieve your bladder. Both of these actions can cause the pelvic floor muscles to give a little, making the urge to pee worse. You probably can't do much about it if you have a coughing fit, but you can make sure the book or video you choose isn't funny enough to make you laugh so hard you pee in your pants. Having an unbearable urge to pee is partly psychological, so thinking about whitewater rafting and spouting geysers really will make you feel worse!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This is an email We'll get pointed questions related to Europe and broadband thanks to Steve Bergstrom. Suggest we answer that we feel confident that the first mover advantage will give us superior returns in the long run. USA: INTERVIEW-Dynegy feels gradual approach in Europe vindicated. By Andrew Kelly  10/15/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Natural gas and power marketer Dynegy Inc. said on Monday it felt vindicated in its step-by-step approach to building a business in Europe in view of recent retrenchments by rival Houston-based companies. Dynegy recently opened an office in Madrid to market natural gas, electricity and derivatives. Spain is the fifth country in continental Europe where Dynegy has set up an office since it started up its European operations in Britain in 1994. By contrast Enron Corp. has recently announced plans to cut staffing at its European operations by 5 percent to 10 percent amid concerns about slow and piecemeal progress toward deregulation of European natural gas and electricity markets. \\"Enron threw 800 bodies at it and tried to do it in a hurry. We've been going at it much more slowly because we thought it would take some time,\\" Dynegy President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Bergstrom told Reuters in an interview. Another Dynegy rival, Reliant Resources Inc., said last month it was considering a possible sale of its electricity generation business in the Netherlands. \\"Reliant bought one utility in one country and realized that's not really the way to enter the market in Europe,\\" Bergstrom said of the move which cost Reliant 2.4 billion. Bergstrom said his own company differed with Enron and Reliant in the execution of its entry into the European market, rather than in its assessment of the market's potential. \\"We've gone at this much more cautiously. We've made sure that we staff it appropriately for the market timing and we think we've done it the right way,\\" he said. Bergstrom said there were similar differences between Dynegy and Enron's approach to the broadband telecommunications market where Enron has also cut jobs after admitting that it probably overestimated the market's short-term potential. \\"They're having to retrench, but you're not hearing them give up on the telecommunications business. Our cost structure is so much less than theirs, that's why we're a lot more optimistic, because they have to go through cutting a bunch of costs whereas we never added those costs,\\" he said. Dynegy reported on Monday its third-quarter net earnings rose 62 percent as its wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. Dynegy has said it expects its broadband business, created late last year, to generate a positive net income next year. The business posted a 15 million loss in the third quarter of 2001. Dynegy's Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson told analysts in a conference call on Monday that the unit's revenues had doubled in the latest quarter to 8 million. \\"We believe the industry touched the bottom in this communications market in the third quarter, with bandwidth demand picking up sharply in the foreseeable future,\\" Watson said.

Campaigners raised £58,182 for the 29ft-long 'baby Khan', which will fly over Parliament Square on 1 September.      A crowdfunding anti-Khan campaign was launched following the giant Donald Trump baby balloon flown by protesters during the president's visit in July.      Mr Khan said: \\"If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini they're welcome to do so.      \\"I don't really think yellow's my colour though.\\"      The giant inflatable - a nod to the controversial 'Beach Body Ready' advert Mr Khan voiced his disapproval for in 2016 - has been approved by City Hall, the police and air traffic controllers NATS.      The fundraising page for the balloon said: \\"In light of the Donald Trump 'Baby Trump' balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the UK, let's get a 'baby Khan' one and see if free speech applies to all.\\"      It adds: \\"Under Sadiq Khan, we have seen crime skyrocket to unprecedented levels.

(Associated Press)      LONDON (AP) — Critics of London Mayor Sadiq Khan have been given permission to fly a giant balloon over London that depicts him dressed in a bikini.      Organizer Yanny Bruere has raised more than 58,000 pounds (75,000) through the Crowdfunder website for the 29-foot (8.8-meter) blimp as part of a campaign to oust Khan from his post.      Khan angered some people in the British capital and elsewhere last month when he allowed a balloon caricaturing Donald Trump as an angry baby to float above the city while the U.S. president was in England.      Bruere cited rising crime and \\"defending free speech\\" as factors in his anti-Khan campaign.

Rosa looks at Fisher with a look of amusement and is impressed by Ben's non fluctuating decisions who clings onto his theories of 'variable change'. After looking at Ben's score on his latest non-linear equations paper, on which he got 97%, Rosa invites Ben to join his blackjack team, which consists of fellow students Choi, Fisher, Jill, and Kianna. Despite being told by Rosa that he had already gotten into the Harvard Medical School, Ben refuses to join the team on the premise he had been promoted at his job.

Then, let's go to the hypothesis which states that \\"Quarterbacks are the least celebrated member of the team.\\"  Comparing the premise and hypothesis: the premise indicates that the quarterbacks are getting most of the attention which implies that they are likely celebrated. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that quarterbacks are the least celebrated. These two statements are contradictory. Therefore, based on this analysis, I would conclude that the answer to whether the hypothesis \\"Quarterbacks are the least celebrated member of the team.\\" is true, is 'no.' The premise gives us information that actively conflicts with this hypothesis, indicating that quarterbacks often receive a lot of attention, thereby implying that they are celebrated, not least celebrated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Lane search through to realize Glass's work was falisified? Title: Shattered Glass Movie plot: It tells the story of Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen), who was the youngest journalist at the New Republic. This newspaper prides itself to have been read by everybody in the political field in Washington, and to be the only one in the American president's plane. Little by little, we see how things work in the editorial room: Stephen's direct boss and editor is Charles \\"Chuck\\" Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), who is constantly insisting on having every single detail checked through direct notes. The first time Stephen gets in trouble in the film it's on an article about a Republican young people convention, where he alleged they got drunk and called some prostitutes. Stephen gets into trouble because the hotel manager complains that hotel rooms did not have any drink or food fridges in them, all the opposite of what Stephen had said in his article. Chuck talks with Stephen about that. Stephen comes back some minutes later admitting he has made a mistake: he saw so many spirits bottles thrown out of the place, that he took it for granted that they came from a room saloon. Stephen says he's sorry, and that if Chuck wants his resignation, he'll sign it right away. However, Chuck is not about to do anything of that sort, and the audience is left feeling that it was too much of a ruckus over the possible existence of a portable fridge or not.Stephen's girlfriend is Caitlin Avey (Chloë Sevigny), a fellow journalist at the newspaper. She is worried because Stephen has had much success lately, she's even a bit jealous. Stephen is freelancing and writing stories for other magazines, like Rolling Stones, because his news stories have always got an edge to them: he investigates, finds out the truth and talks about humourous situations and peculiar characters. Also, to Caitlin's dismay, he's even going to be busier, as he is about to start to study law, which he considers to be more prestigious.

Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA operative sent to steer the war according to Americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a third player to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This third player was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thé's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security. When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.

The story revolves around the love triangle that develops among a British journalist named Fowler, a young American CIA operative named Pyle, and a Vietnamese girl named Phuong. The storyline also emphasizes the growing American involvement and political turmoil that leads to the Vietnam War. Pyle represents America's interests in Vietnam and has been sent to the country to steer the war in America's favor, following the ideologies of foreign policy theorist York Harding. Pyle believes Vietnam needs a third player to take the place of the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels to restore order – this third player being America. As a result, he creates a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group led by corrupt militia leader General Thé. By arming General Thé's militia with American weaponry, a series of terrorist bombings is initiated in Saigon. These bombings are wrongfully blamed on the Communists to fuel American outrage, and they result in multiple civilian casualties, including women and children. In the midst of these events, Pyle steals Fowler's Vietnamese mistress, Phuong, by promising her a secure and married life. Upon discovering Pyle's involvement in the bombings, Fowler makes a decisive move that seals the fates of all three main characters. He indirectly allows his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts to confront Pyle. As Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him. Following the resolution of these events, Phuong returns to Fowler. Although the local French police commander suspects Fowler's involvement in Pyle's murder, he cannot gather any evidence to incriminate him, allowing Fowler to evade any possible consequences. In conclusion, Hinh, Fowler's assistant, is the one who stabs Pyle in the movie \\"The Quiet American.\\" The film portrays a love story intertwined with political events, which ultimately showcases the impact of American foreign policy and ideologies as a precursor to the Vietnam War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's impossible to say While the context provides information about Baby Bash's first major label studio album, Tha Smokin' Nephew, and its success, it does not provide any definitive evidence to support the hypothesis that Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. The album's success, which includes making it to number 48 on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 and reaching RIAA Gold certification, is noteworthy; however, there are many factors that can influence the success of a future album release. For example, the music industry is constantly evolving, with changes in consumer preferences, distribution channels, and promotional strategies. These factors can impact an artist's ability to achieve commercial success with a subsequent album. Additionally, predicting the critical reception of an album is difficult, as music tastes differ widely among listeners and critics. Trends in musical genres also come and go, which can impact an artist's relevance and appeal to a broad audience. Furthermore, the level of success of Baby Bash's future albums may depend on the artist's ability to maintain or grow his fan base, as well as collaborating with other established musicians and producers in the industry. The specific timing of an album's release, its competition in the market, and its promotion can all play a role in determining its overall success. While it is possible that Baby Bash could release an album that exceeds the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew, based on the provided context, it is impossible to predict this outcome with certainty. Success in the music industry is dependent on a multitude of factors, many of which are outside an artist's control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Both campaigns are attempting to secure the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), who controls 356 convention delegates, enough to clinch the nomination for either candidate. After a debate at Miami University, Meyers is asked by Pullman's campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), to meet in secret. Meyers calls his boss, senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who doesn't answer. Meyers decides to meet Duffy, who offers Meyers a position in Pullman's campaign, an offer Meyers refuses. Zara calls Meyers back and asks what was important, but Meyers says it was nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), an attractive intern for Morris's campaign and daughter of Jack Stearns, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, and that Duffy said his candidate will offer Thompson the position of Secretary of State, guaranteeing Pullman's victory. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson to secure his endorsement and his delegates' votes.

Answer:","output":"The Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street-smart children, first appear in the Sherlock Holmes story titled \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and published in 1887. This is the very first story that introduces the world to the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his dear friend Dr. John Watson. In \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" Dr. John Watson is introduced to Sherlock Holmes, and the two quickly become flatmates at 221B Baker Street in London. The story then revolves around a murder mystery that Holmes is trying to solve. The Baker Street Irregulars are introduced as a group of teenage boys who are employed by Holmes, serving as a clandestine intelligence network on the streets of London. Sherlock Holmes refers to these young men as his \\"Baker Street division of the detective police force.\\" He values their ability to slip in and out of places unnoticed, gather information, and interact with the people who would otherwise be wary of adult investigators. Holmes often relies on their local knowledge, perception, and resourcefulness. Their leader, a young boy named Wiggins, is the principal contact between the Irregulars and Holmes. He is directly responsible for reporting any relevant information gathered by the group to the detective. In \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" Wiggins helps Holmes by quickly bringing him information he needs to move forward with the investigation. The Baker Street Irregulars appear in other Sherlock Holmes stories as well, such as \\"The Sign of the Four\\" (1890) and \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\" (1893). Though they only make a few appearances throughout the entire canon, their sharp eyes and ears significantly contribute to the resolution of the cases they are involved in. In conclusion, the Baker Street Irregulars make their first appearance in \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" assisting Sherlock Holmes in solving the murder mystery that comprises the plot of the narrative. Their keen observational skills and ability to blend into the background of London's streets prove invaluable to the iconic detective, making them a fascinating and essential part of the Holmesian world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Break down the sentence: The original English sentence is \\"Use: Instantly increases your rage by 20.\\" In this context, \\"use\\" is an instruction, \\"instantly increases your rage\\" is the action, and \\"by 20\\" is the extent of the action. 2. Translation:    - \\"Use\\" translates as \\"Utilisation\\" in French. However, in most game contexts, a simple \\"Utilisez\\" (meaning \\"Use\\") could be more appropriate because it is an imperative verb form used for instructions.    - \\"Instantly increases your rage\\" can be translated as \\"augmente instantanément votre rage\\".    - \\"by 20\\" can be translated as \\"de 20\\".  By putting those parts together, the French translation could be: \\"Utilisez : Augmente instantanément votre rage de 20\\".  It's worth mentioning that the verbs and nouns may need to be adjusted depending on the game's context and intended audience. For instance, if \\"rage\\" is a specific term used in the game, it may be better to keep it untranslated. Also \\"Utilisez\\" could be replaced by \\"Usage\\" in some contexts.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers. A list contains numbers separated by a comma. You need to round every integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'. If an integer is exactly in equally far from two different powers of 2 then you should output the larger power of 2. The output should be a list of integers that is the result of rounding each integer int the input list to the closest power of 2. The output should include a '[' to denote the start of the output list and ']' to denote the end of the output list. Input: [71, 167, 2224, 4869, 18, 34, 4, 24, 302, 385, 2179] Output:","output":"This task is asking you to take a list of integers as input and then round each integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. In case an integer is equidistant from two different powers of 2, you should choose the larger power of 2. The result should be presented as a list of integers, enclosed by square brackets. Here's how to approach this task step-by-step: 1. Take the list of integers as input. For example, the given input is:    [71, 167, 2224, 4869, 18, 34, 4, 24, 302, 385, 2179] 2. For each integer in the list, find the closest power of 2 by following these steps:    a. Determine the lower and upper powers of 2 that the integer is between. For example, if the number is 71, the lower power of 2 it is closest to is 64 (2^6), and the upper power of 2 is 128 (2^7).    b. Calculate the difference between the integer and both the lower and upper powers of 2. In this case, the difference between 71 and 64 is 7, and the difference between 71 and 128 is 57.    c. Pick the power of 2 that has the smallest difference. If both differences are equal, choose the larger power of 2. In this case, the smallest difference is between 71 and 64, so 64 would be the rounded power of 2 for the number 71. 3. Repeat step 2 for each integer in the input list. 4. Collect the rounded powers of 2 as the output list. Continuing with our example, the output list would be:    [64, 128, 2048, 4096, 16, 32, 4, 16, 256, 256, 2048] 5. Finally, add square brackets at the beginning and the end of the output list to denote the list format. So, the final output would look like this:        [64, 128, 2048, 4096, 16, 32, 4, 16, 256, 256, 2048]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Here is a news article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French President Nicolas Sarkozy: \\"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers\\"      Four French soldiers have been killed in northern Afghanistan after a serviceman from the Afghan National Army opened fire, officials say.      Another 16 French soldiers were injured, some seriously, in the incident in Kapisa province.      An official told the BBC that an Afghan non-commissioned officer got into a \\"verbal clash\\" and opened fire.      President Nicolas Sarkozy said France was suspending its training programmes in Afghanistan following the attack.      He was sending his Defence Minister Gerard Longuet to the country immediately, he said.      Analysis President Sarkozy used very tough language to condemn the attack. French soldiers, he said, were in Afghanistan to help their allies. \\"We cannot accept that a single one of our troops should be killed or wounded by those allies,\\" he said. The president said that Defence Minister Gerard Longuet will on his return from Afghanistan deliver a report on security conditions there for French troops. If these are not satisfactory, he said, then the question of an early withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan will be on the table. Q&A: Foreign forces in Afghanistan      Mr Sarkozy said that the question of an early French withdrawal from Afghanistan would arise if security conditions were not re-established.      He said it was unacceptable for French troops to be fired on by their allies.      A Taliban spokesman said it was not clear if the attacker was a member of their group but described him as a \\"conscientious Afghan soldier\\".      'Murdered'      Thursday's incident, in the Tagab district, took place at 08:00 local time (03:30 GMT), according to French media reports.      \\"We understand that during a fitness exercise some of our soldiers were suddenly attacked by an Afghan soldier, so they were unarmed,\\" French foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told the BBC.      \\"They were murdered. It was impossible for them, first of all, to know what was going to happen and secondly to react to this aggression,\\" he added.      The attack brings to 82 the total number of French personnel killed in Afghanistan since 2001.      An Afghan official told the BBC: \\"This is a tragic incident, a sad and tragic day for us and for Nato.\\" The Afghan soldier was arrested by the French, he said.      Nato confirmed in a statement that four of its personnel had been killed, and that a suspect had been apprehended, but gave no further details.      Afghan President Hamid Karzai released a statement conveying \\"his deepest condolences and sympathy to the French president, families of the victims and to the French people\\".      The relationship between the two countries was \\"historic\\" and \\"honest,\\" and a source of happiness, he said. President Karzai is due to meet Mr Sarkozy in Paris next week.      The BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says there has been an increasing number of incidents involving Afghan soldiers turning their weapons on Nato forces.      The Afghan government has failed to come up with a solution or a strategy to prevent such attacks, he says.      Recent Afghan 'turncoat' attacks 9 January 2012: US soldier killed by Afghan in army uniform      29 December 2011: Two French troops killed by Afghan soldier      29 October: Three Australian troops killed by man in Afghan army uniform      4 August: Nato soldier killed by Afghan in police uniform      16 July: Nato member killed by Afghan army soldier Anatomy of an Afghan 'turncoat' killer      Three weeks ago two members of the French Foreign Legion were shot dead by an Afghan National Army soldier, also in Kapisa province.      Five French soldiers were killed by a suicide bomb while on patrol in the Tagab district of Kapisa in July 2011.      That was the heaviest loss of French life in Afghanistan since 10 soldiers were killed in a Taliban ambush in the Sarobi area, east of Kabul, in August 2008.      2011 was France's bloodiest year in Afghanistan with the loss of 26 personnel. The risks faced by French forces have increased as the areas of the country where they are stationed have become less stable.      'Difficult decision'      French troops have been part of the Nato-led operation in Afghanistan since 2001, and the country currently has 3,600 troops there.      President Sarkozy announced in July that 1,000 troops would be withdrawn from the country by the end of 2012, ahead of full Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014.      Mr Sarkozy faces re-election this year and the loss of French life in Afghanistan is a highly politically sensitive issue in France.      The socialist challenger for the presidency, Francois Hollande - who is ahead of Mr Sarkozy in opinion polls - has reiterated his position that he would withdraw French troops by the end of the year, if elected.      A senior commander with the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Kabul said he was speechless at the prospect of a potential French withdrawal. France is one of the few members of Isaf to have more than 1,000 troops in Afghanistan.      Commenting on the gun attack, Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said such incidents were relatively rare.      \\"The reality is that every day, 130,000 Isaf troops from 50 nations fight and train with over 300,000 Afghan soldiers. That takes a lot of trust among a lot of soldiers,\\" he said.      In a separate development, a Nato helicopter has crashed in southern Afghanistan killing six soldiers. The nationalities of those killed has not been disclosed but they are believed to be American.      The Taliban said they killed the soldiers, but an Isaf spokesman said there was no enemy activity in the area at the time. ||||| An Afghan soldier shot and killed four French troops Friday in eastern Afghanistan and a helicopter crash killed six more NATO service members in the south, officials said, marking a particularly deadly 24 hours for coalition forces.      French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Friday that France is suspending its training programs for Afghan troops after the killings, which he announced in a speech after the U.S.-led coalition said an Afghan soldier shot and killed four NATO troops.      Sarkozy said it was \\"unacceptable\\" that Afghan troops would attack French soldiers. He said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is heading to Afghanistan after the attack, which is among the most deadly for French forces in the 10 years they have been serving in the NATO-led international force in Afghanistan.      NATO said in statements that the Afghan shooter had been apprehended, but it disclosed no details about the incident.      Similar attacks have raised fears of increased Taliban infiltration of the Afghan police and army as NATO speeds up the training of the security forces. In some cases the attackers were Afghan soldiers who turned on NATO troops. Others involved insurgents dressed in Afghan uniforms.      Earlier this month, a U.S. service member was killed when a man in an Afghan army uniform opened fire at a base in the south of the country.      In one of the worst incidents, a veteran Afghan military pilot opened fire at Kabul airport on April 27, 2011, killing eight U.S. troops and an American civilian contractor.      U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings Jr., a spokesman for the coalition, said Friday that cases where Afghan soldiers have wounded or killed coalition forces are isolated cases and do not occur on a routine basis. \\"We train and are partnered with Afghan personnel every day and we are not seeing any issues or concerns with our relationships,\\" he said.      Late Thursday, a NATO helicopter crashed, killing six members of the international military force.      The cause is still being investigated, but a coalition statement said there was no enemy activity in the area at the time of the crash.      Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef claimed insurgents shot down the helicopter, a Chinook, in Musa Qala district of Helmand province, killing all on board.      The coalition did not disclose the nationalities of those killed and would not release details of the crash until the families of the dead were notified.      It was the deadliest crash in Afghanistan since August, when 30 American troops died after a Chinook helicopter was apparently shot down in Wardak province in the center of the country. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"On January 20, 2012, four French soldiers were killed and 16 others injured in northern Afghanistan's Kapisa province after an Afghan National Army serviceman opened fire. Following this, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the suspension of France's training programs for Afghan troops and sent Defence Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan. Mr. Sarkozy also stated that early withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan would become a consideration if security conditions did not improve. In total, 82 French personnel were killed in Afghanistan since 2001. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, as there is an increasing number of incidents of Afghan soldiers turning against NATO forces, raising concerns of Taliban infiltration into Afghan security forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"A: Yes, the supposed perturbation (fever) has an effect on the body cooling process, both directly and indirectly. When a person has a fever, their body temperature rises, which is the initial step in the body cooling process. This elevated temperature triggers the brain to tell blood vessels to dilate. As a result, blood flow increases, helping to dissipate heat. The elevated body temperature also causes sweat glands to become more active, releasing moisture from the pores. This moisture then evaporates, leading to a cooling effect on the body. In this case, the fever acts as a direct catalyst for the body's cooling mechanisms, indirectly leading to more body cooling occurring in an attempt to bring the body temperature back to normal or reduce the fever."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Young was born in Compton, California, the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur R&B singing group, The Romells. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka. Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, \\"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.\\" Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he \\"used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you'd never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ.\\" Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers.  After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on \\"Lil' Ghetto Boy\\" and \\"Let Me Ride\\" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.  In 1999, Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre's productions. Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.

Under the Abortion Act of 1967, abortions are legal and can be performed at or before 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Wales, and Scotland. The laws in Northern Ireland are different than the rest of the U.K. Abortions after 24 weeks are only permitted when the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the mother or if there is significant evidence of fatal fetal abnormalities. Two doctors must agree that it is in the patient’s best interest to terminate the pregnancy. This usually includes your general practitioner and the doctor performing the procedure.

If you wish to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible, seeking care at a private clinic may be the best option for you. You will most likely have a consultation and the procedure within one week. Details concerning your health and the procedure are confidential.

Article: Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by \\"triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate\\". Question: What is the earliest records of humans using pesticides?","output":"The earliest records of humans using pesticides date back to around 2000 BC, with the first known pesticide being elemental sulfur dusting, which was used in ancient Sumer, a region in ancient Mesopotamia, approximately 4,500 years ago. Another early reference to the use of pesticides can be found in the Rig Veda, an ancient Indian text that is about 4,000 years old. It mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control purposes. These early practices demonstrate the longstanding human effort to protect crops from harmful pests by utilizing various substances as pesticides and providing a foundation for modern pest control techniques."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Figure out if something is occurring that you don’t know about. Help your child identify their feelings. Article:","output":"Title: Identifying and Addressing Psychological Issues in Children: A Parent's Guide Introduction As parents, we are ultimately responsible for our children's well-being, both physically and emotionally. At times, understanding the true source of our child's discomfort or distress can be challenging. Psychological issues can manifest as behavioral or emotional symptoms that can be difficult to recognize and acknowledge. This article aims to provide guidance on determining if your child may be experiencing a psychological issue, and how to support and help them through the process. 1. Determine if your child has a psychological issue It's essential first to recognize that what may appear as disobedience or mood swings in children may sometimes be a sign of a deeper, underlying psychological issue. To determine if your child is experiencing psychological difficulties, it's crucial to remain observant and aware of any significant changes in their behavior, mood, or communication. If you notice symptoms such as excessive moodiness, irritability, lack of motivation, or withdrawal from social activities, it is wise to consider the possibility of a psychological issue. 2. Rule out any physical pain Before attributing a child's discomfort to psychological issues, it's necessary to rule out any physical sources of pain or discomfort. Consult with your pediatrician if you have concerns about your child's health, as they can assess for any medical conditions that may be causing distress. Persistent headaches, stomach aches, or any other unexplained physical discomfort should always be evaluated by a professional before assuming psychological factors are at play. 3. Investigate potential hidden factors If there is no identifiable physical source of discomfort, consider possible hidden factors that may be affecting your child. Bullying, academic struggles, pressures to meet expectations, or conflicts with friends can all contribute to psychological distress. Engaging in open, non-judgmental conversations with your child is essential to uncover any potential issues. Offering support and empathizing with their feelings will make them feel comfortable and well-equipped to share any struggles they may be experiencing. 4. Help your child identify their feelings Development of emotional intelligence is crucial for children's emotional well-being and ability to navigate the world effectively. Start by helping your child recognize, understand, and label the emotions they are experiencing. Encourage them to talk about their feelings and listen attentively without judgment or criticism. 5. Offer support and encourage professional help if needed It's essential for parents to provide emotional support and reassurance when their child is experiencing psychological distress. Keep in mind that it can also be beneficial to seek professional help from psychologists, psychiatrists, or counselors in more severe instances. They can provide insight, evaluation, and treatment options for various issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, or other mental health disorders. In conclusion, recognizing psychological issues in children begins with staying attentive to changes in their behavior, emotions, and communication. Ruling out any physical pain or discomfort, investigating potential hidden factors, and helping your child identify and express their feelings is crucial in addressing and managing these issues. Parental support and empathy, along with seeking appropriate professional help when necessary, can significantly improve your child's mental and emotional well-being, ensuring they grow up to be happy, healthy, and emotionally resilient individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If other studies relevant to the issue are available, havetheir results been presented and reconciled with the case study findings? Sentence 2: Results cannot be assessed do to implosion of the earth. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The validity of the second sentence doesn't directly depend on the first one. Both statements address different topics and do not have a cause-and-effect relationship.  The first sentence is considering the analytical and comparative perspective of a case study. It's questioning whether the results from other relevant studies have been duly presented and reconciled with the case study findings. This type of question is asked typically in a research context, where studies or cases are compared against each other to recognize patterns, establish theories, or draw conclusions. On the other hand, the second sentence declares the impossibility of assessing results due to a catastrophic event: the \\"implosion of the Earth\\". This statement seems to be theoretical or hypothetical, as an actual implosion of Earth hasn't occurred. Such an event would indeed make impossible to assess anything, as it presupposes the end of all life and typical circumstances on the planet. However, the first sentence does not affect the second, or vice-versa. The comparison and reconciliation of study findings have no evident connection with a global catastrophe preventing assessment. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, it doesn’t necessarily make the second sentence true too, because their topics and contexts are not related.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is evicting families? Movie plot title: Roger & Me Movie plot: Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as \\"kind of a strange child,\\" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an \\"up-close-and-personal\\" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories. He tries to visit Smith at GM's headquarters in Detroit, yet he is blocked by building security guards as Moore hasn't made an appointment.

Smith, announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers in order to relocate the plant to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. This decision leads to economic and social crises in Flint, Michigan, resulting in numerous families losing their jobs and being unable to sustain their livelihood, ultimately facing eviction from their homes. The actions of GM and the consequential widespread unemployment prompt Michael Moore to seek answers from Roger B. Smith, holding him accountable for the devastating impact on the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If \\"The guy on a skateboard unbelievably jumps over a high barrier.\\", does it logically follow that \\"the guy is riding a bike.\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"the guy is riding a bike\\" from the statement \\"The guy on a skateboard unbelievably jumps over a high barrier.\\" The original statement clearly describes the guy as being \\"on a skateboard\\". A skateboard and a bike are two different types of vehicles or modes of transportation. Skateboards are usually propelled by kicking one's foot against the ground while standing on the board, whereas a bike, short for bicycle, is a vehicle that has two wheels in line, powered by human effort via pedals. They are different in terms of structure, shape, number of wheels, method of propulsion, the way they are handled, and many other aspects. Because of these clear differences, one cannot assume interchangeability between these two objects based on the given sentence. Logically, if the subject was on a skateboard in the initial sentence, he could not have simultaneously been on a bike unless otherwise stated. Logic, by its nature, seeks consistency. In a similar fashion, the law of noncontradiction — a classic principle of logic — posits that two or more conflicting statements cannot all be true at the same time. Therefore, saying \\"the guy is riding a bike\\" directly after the initial statement contradicts the specified mode of transport (i.e., the skateboard). While it is plausible in a broader context that the guy might ride a bike at another moment, based on the information currently provided this conclusion cannot be drawn.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Not worth the money Review: My expectations were high for this book based on the previous reviews. Unfortunately, it was an exercise in redundancy. Entire chapters were attempts to stretch a singular point well beyond the amount of words it requires to actually communicate the point. When useful exercises and figures were finally included in the book, they were nothing more than could be found for free in a basic web search. The rest of the pages were filled with insistence that this is science in a quantity so over the top that it reads as desperation to convince rather than a simple assertion of facts. Save your money and just do a google search. Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this review is negative.  Justifications: 1. The user expressed disappointment with phrases like \\"not worth the money\\", \\"unfortunately\\", and \\"exercise in redundancy\\". These all indicate dissatisfaction with the product and hence, a negative tone. 2. The reviewer mentioned that the chapters were stretched and the information could be obtained freely from a simple web search, which shows discontentment. 3. The term \\"desperation to convince\\" indicates the user's disagreement with the author's presentation method, suggesting they didn't perceive it as valid or beneficial.  4. The advice at the end to \\"save your money and just do a Google search\\" further emphasizes the negative tone, as the reviewer is advising others not to spend their money on this product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would Casey feel about what happened?\\", is \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Casey feel about what happened?\\".  There are numerous reasons for this.  Firstly, from the provided background, it is clear that Casey's pool was not maintained adequately each year, which has now led it to leak water. There's a sense of negligence towards the pool by either Casey or whoever was responsible for maintaining it, and this consequently caused the issue with the pool leakage.  Given that the pool is leaking water due to poor maintenance, it is unlikely for Casey to be happy about the pool's condition. A leaking pool generally demands more consistent care and repair work, which can be quite frustrating and financially burdensome for the owner. It would be more reasonable to assume that Casey might feel concerned, disappointed, or even annoyed about the situation. Moreover, pools are often considered a valuable asset and a source of enjoyment for homeowners. A well-maintained pool can provide countless hours of relaxation, socializing, and exercise; therefore, a leaking pool would considerably diminish those benefits. This would naturally lead to negative emotions such as frustration or dissatisfaction, rather than happiness regarding the pool's state. In addition, a leaking pool also poses potential safety hazards and environmental concerns. The constant loss of water may lead to increased water bills and unnecessary wastage of resources. It may also weaken the structural foundation of the pool itself and the surrounding area, causing potential accidents. Therefore, it is implausible that Casey would associate happiness with these unfavorable outcomes. To sum up, while it's essential to acknowledge people's emotions can vary and that there may be outliers in any given situation, it does not make sense to argue that Casey would be \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" in this case. Instead, it is far more likely that negative feelings, such as frustration, disappointment, or concern, would arise due to the repercussions of poor maintenance and unforeseen consequences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This House would decriminalise sadomasochism What is a possible side to this debate?","output":"A possible side to this debate can be in favor of decriminalizing sadomasochism. For that, we need to analyze the reasons that support this standpoint, such as consent between involved parties, privacy rights, and the potential benefits of decriminalization. 1. Consent: Supporters of decriminalizing sadomasochism emphasize the importance of consent between all parties involved. Sadomasochism is a consensual practice between adults who have negotiated their boundaries, desires, and limits beforehand. Thus, decriminalizing such activities would rely on mutual consent, which negates the assumption of violence or abuse in the context of sadomasochism.  2. Private and consensual acts between adults: Decriminalizing sadomasochism would also respect the privacy rights of individuals and their ability to engage in consensual activities within the confines of their homes. The government or law should not interfere in personal lives, given that no harm is done to uninvolved individuals and the acts involved are private. 3. Education and safety awareness: Decriminalizing sadomasochism would allow professionals and educators to provide valuable information and resources for individuals interested in engaging in these consent-based relationships. Proper education can reduce the risks associated with such practices and promote a safer environment for participants. 4. Reduction in prejudice and discrimination: Sadomasochism has long been stigmatized and considered taboo in most societies. Decriminalizing it can help reduce prejudice and discrimination against those who engage in consensual sadomasochistic activities. It would provide a more inclusive and tolerant society, which recognizes and respects individual choices and preferences as long as consent is maintained. 5. Empowerment of individuals: Decriminalization would help empower individuals to explore their desires and fantasies within the realm of consent and safety. By removing the stigma, individuals who engage in sadomasochism would be able to enjoy their relationships without fear of judgement or legal repercussions. 6. Health and mental well-being: Studies have shown that individuals who engage in consensual BDSM activities (which include sadomasochism) report a high level of satisfaction with their practice and self-identify more positively compared to those who do not engage in such acts. Decriminalizing such practices may contribute to improved mental health and well-being by providing a safe space for individuals to explore their desires without fear of legal consequences. 7. Reduced pressure on the legal system: By decriminalizing sadomasochism, the legal system can focus on cases involving actual harm, violence, and non-consensual activities. This would allow law enforcement and courts to allocate their resources more efficiently while leaving consensual activities to be monitored and regulated by the participants themselves. In conclusion, decriminalizing sadomasochism can be seen as a way to respect individual rights to autonomy and privacy by allowing consensual activities to occur without interference. Advocates believe that this would promote consent-based relationships, enhance education and safety awareness, and reduce the stigma and discrimination against those who participate in such activities. Additionally, it would allow the legal system to focus on more pressing matters, while potentially improving the mental health and well-being of individuals who engage in consensual sadomasochistic relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.  Question: suppose drinking low acidic drinks like keifer happens, how will it affect stomach will process food efficiently.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"Drinking low acidic drinks like kefir will have minimal to no effect on the stomach's ability to process food efficiently. The stomach naturally secretes acid, primarily hydrochloric acid, which helps in breaking down and digesting food. When a low acidic drink like kefir is consumed, it does not significantly alter the acidic environment of the stomach. The stomach can still efficiently release an adequate amount of acid required for digestion, regardless of the low acidity from the kefir. Furthermore, kefir contains probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that promote gut health. These probiotics can support the digestive process and even contribute to better nutrient absorption, promoting overall gut health. Therefore, drinking kefir may have a positive effect on the stomach and digestion rather than hindering its efficiency. In summary, drinking low acidic drinks like kefir will have little to no effect on the stomach's ability to process food efficiently, and may even have some positive effects on digestion and gut health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As its title suggests, the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby’s Geneva is a treasure trove of gems and unique jewels that are a feast for the eyes. I have chosen a few highlights that represent the diversity of the sale and it will be interesting to see how each will perform. The Blue Moon diamondThis magnificent 12.03-carat Internally Flawless, Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, dubbed the Blue Moon, has gained a lot of attention. The cushion brilliant-cut diamond is an amazing, intense blue colour with no hint of grey which is normally the case with blue diamonds. After seeing the Blue Moon I visited the Smithsonian Natural History Museum where the most famous blue diamond in the world resides: the Hope blue diamond. Having made a mental note of the colour of the Blue Moon, I compared the two diamonds. Although they are very similar, the Hope has a much darker blue undertone while the Blue Moon is more vibrant with an even saturation. They can be seen as freaks of nature, created when boron is mixed with carbon during the gem’s formation deep within the earth’s crust. And contrary to what may be perceived, blue diamonds are extremely rare, as only 0.1 per cent of diamonds show any evidence of blue colour. The Hope crystal was discovered in January 2014 in the famous Cullinan Mine in South Africa now owned by Petra Diamonds, weighing 29.62 carats. It took over six months to cut and polish, a nerve-racking job as there is no room for error. So far the world record auction price for a diamond and any jewel is the Graff Pink, which sold for 46,158,674 in November 2010. The Blue Moon is being auctioned with a high estimate of 55 million, so this is a wonderful opportunity to watch the sale live on the Sotheby’s website and possibly witness history being made. Estimate 35-55 million The Queen Maria-José ruby ringRubies are the king of all coloured gemstones and good quality, unheated stones weighing over five carats that still shine brightly with an intensity of fire are extremely rare. When you pick up a ruby whose vibrancy of colour in incandescent light is like a red electric light bulb, you know that you are holding a true gem. However, any significant gemstone’s origin and authenticity has to be confirmed by an internationally-recognised gemmological laboratory report. This ruby, weighing 8.48 carats, is from the old ruby mines in Burma and as rubies have always represented passion it was a very fitting gift from Italian bibliophile Tammaro de Marinis on the occasion of Maria-José’s wedding to Crown Prince Umberto in 1930. Set in a charming gold and diamond ring mount, I am sure it will attract the attention of a future suitor. Estimate 6-9 million Jabot Pin by Cartier, circa 1920With the eagerly awaited exhibition Bejewelled Treasures: The Al Thani Collection opening at the Victoria & Albert Museum on November 21st, I could not resist picking out this jewel as it would be perfect to wear while visiting the exhibition. This jabot pin’s design has been inspired by the traditional Indian sarpech, a turban ornament. Europe was first introduced to Indian jewellery, with its brightly coloured enamels along with sumptuous pearls and diamonds, at the time of the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1876 and Indian jewellery then became in vogue, although it was the Exposition Universelle 1900 in Paris when Cartier created an “Indian” ring that paved the way for Indian-inspired jewels to become sought after by the ladies of high society Europe. Perhaps the V&A’s upcoming exhibition will spark a similar modern-day trend. Estimate 115,000-225,000 All items will be auctioned at the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby's Geneva on November 11 What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about a special event called the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby's Geneva. There are many precious gems and jewels at the event. One very special gem is the Blue Moon diamond, which is a very rare, vibrant blue color. It might break the world record for the most expensive jewel ever sold at auction. There's also a beautiful ruby ring from the Queen Maria-Jose, and a special pin made by Cartier.

Answer:","output":"Given the question \\"What will happen to Tracy?\\" after she visits Kendall's place, despite Kendall expressing that he didn't want to be bothered, the answer \\"be welcomed by Kendall\\" could be considered valid but uncertain. Human behavior and emotions are complex, and understanding the context of their relationship and analyzing various possibilities is crucial to provide a comprehensive answer. There is a chance that Kendall could welcome Tracy despite his initial statement. It is essential to consider that people's moods and opinions can change, and Kendall might feel differently about Tracy's presence upon arrival. In this case, Kendall may appreciate that Tracy cared enough to visit him and chose to ignore his initial request. On the other hand, it is also possible that Kendall may not welcome Tracy, as he expressly communicated his desire to be left alone. In this situation, Kendall might feel that Tracy disrespected his boundaries, leading to potential conflict or tension in their relationship. Furthermore, other factors play a vital role in the outcome: the nature of their relationship, the reason behind Kendall's desire for solitude, and Tracy's intention for visiting him. Understanding these nuances will lead to a more accurate assessment of whether or not Tracy would be welcomed by Kendall. In conclusion, while it is possible for Tracy to be welcomed by Kendall, the answer is uncertain without sufficient contextual information. Human behavior is intricate, and predicting reactions requires a comprehensive understanding of their relationship, intentions, and emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It highlights the influence Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return of the Spirit had on him, emphasizing the idea of a strong, representative leader. Nevertheless, the political theory that truly fascinated Nasser was Arab Socialism or Arab Nationalism combined with socialism. Nasser sought to unify the Arab world and promote social justice and economic development, principles that he believed could not be achieved without a solid socialist foundation.  Nasser's Arab Socialism largely focused on the following key principles: 1. Arab Unity: Nasser sought to create a unified Arab state, transcending nationalist boundaries, and prioritizing the shared history, language, and culture of the Arab peoples. For him, the Arab world was not just a group of separate nations but a single entity, which needed to come together to fight against colonialism and imperialism. 2. Economic Development: Nasserism is based on socialist principles that promote social justice and equitable distribution of wealth. Nasser sought to nationalize key industries, especially the Suez Canal, as a means of securing financial independence from foreign powers and providing for social welfare programs to benefit all citizens.  3. Social Justice: The core philosophy of Nasser's Arab Socialism was uplifting the oppressed and marginalized communities. His policies aimed at reducing income inequality, providing better education and healthcare, redistributing land, and ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens. 4. Anti-Imperialism: One of the defining features of Nasserism was its staunch opposition to colonial and imperial powers. Nasser believed that the Arab world could only achieve true independence, growth, and prosperity by breaking free from the influence of imperialist nations. 5. Non-Alignment: In the context of the Cold War, Nasser followed a policy of nonalignment, aiming to create strong ties with both Eastern and Western blocs without getting involved in their rivalry. He believed that aligning with one side would jeopardize the objective of Arab unity and undermine efforts to resist external influences. While the influence of Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return of the Spirit is evident in Nasser's belief in a strong, representative leader, it is important to recognize that Nasser's fascination with political theory revolved around Arab Socialism. This ideological foundation ultimately played a significant role in shaping the policies pursued during his presidency and his broader vision for the Arab world."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The equation contains two terms with the variable r: 120*r and -91*r. We need to combine them. 120*r - 91*r = (120 - 91) * r (120 - 91) * r = 29*r Now the equation looks like this: 0 = 29*r - 174 Step 2: Isolate the variable r. To isolate r, we want to get rid of the constant term -174. We can do this by adding 174 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 174 = 29*r - 174 + 174 This simplifies to: 174 = 29*r Step 3: Solve for r. Now that we have isolated the variable r, we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 29: 174 / 29 = 29*r / 29 This becomes: 6 = r Now we know that r = 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  and the situation: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Answer the following question: Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Answer:","output":"The group that didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training was the Blue group, which primarily focused on weight training for three months.  The Blue group, by engaging in weight lifting exercises, concentrated on building their skeletal muscles and increasing their size and strength. Weight training exercises involve the use of resistance to promote muscular contraction, which ultimately leads to the development of muscle mass and overall strength. During these exercises, the primary focus is on skeletal muscle contraction, and while the heart rate might increase due to the exertion, the primary impact is not on increasing the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, was primarily focused on exercises aimed at improving their cardiovascular fitness. Running is an aerobic exercise that involves the repeated and continuous contraction of the cardiac muscle, leading to a faster heart rate and an increased volume of blood being pumped by the heart. This type of exercise greatly contributes to the strengthening of the cardiac muscles, leading to enhanced heart functioning and overall cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the Blue group, which concentrated on weight training exercises, experienced less of an increase in their hearts pumping more blood compared to the Brown group, who engaged in daily running sessions meant to improve their cardiovascular fitness and the efficiency of their cardiac muscles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reuters - Wall Street investors will get theirfirst glimpses in September of how companies performed in thethird quarter, and financial experts say don't look for toomany positive earnings surprises. Which is the best summary of this article?","output":"This article indicates that Wall Street investors are set to receive initial insights into companies' third-quarter performance in September. However, financial experts are suggesting that these disclosures may not carry many positive earnings surprises. The article does not provide specific details on why optimism is low, but such caution typically arises from factors such as economic trends, company indicators, or general market behavior. In stock market dynamics, earnings reports are valuable for investors as they can significantly influence stock prices - positive surprises typically boost share prices, while disappointing results can cause them to plummet. Hence, investors' anticipation is a reflection of their concern over the potential impact on their investment portfolios. Downsides are particularly worrying since they can initiate sell-offs, leading to broader market downturns. Investors, therefore, must brace themselves for any unexpected shocks and adopt appropriate strategies to safeguard their investments. Besides, they may also need to align their expectations to new realities, especially in volatile and uncertain times. This, however, does not rule out the possibility of positive surprises that may emerge against the odds.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the people who are born to the same mother? ?  The film opens as a pregnant woman gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10–13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap.  Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood. The newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer; a deranged human who believed he was a Brother. Answer:","output":"The names of the people who are born to the same mother are Silus and Edgar."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the tone and emotions conveyed: The tone of the tweet is somewhat light-hearted, as the user uses the metaphor of a \\"knight in shining armor\\" to describe their desired assistance. This indicates that the tweet might not be entirely negative, but it also doesn't express strong positivity. 3. Consider the context: Without any knowledge of the specific situation the user is referring to, it is difficult to accurately gauge the sentiment.

I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be. Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died, she knew he was going to be alright. Several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.

Step 2: Analyze the information to see if it supports the hypothesis. The collection is mentioned to be composed of various types of fashionable items, including dresses, accessories, and other items.

Also living with J's grandmother are her three sons, the Cody Boys. Her eldest son is an armed robber named Andrew 'Pope' Cody, and is in hiding from a group of renegade detectives. The middle brother, Craig, is a successful but volatile drug dealer, and youngest brother Darren follows the lead of his older brothers.J's uncle Craig takes J for a drive and is insulted at a set of traffic lights by a man in a neighbouring car. After handing J a handgun, Craig follows the man and his accomplice to an alley, where the car pulls up and the man gets out, attempting to provoke a fight between himself and Craig. Instead, Craig prompts J to get out of the car and scare off the assailant.Later, Pope's best friend and partner in crime Barry 'Baz' Brown goes to meet Pope at a shopping center claiming that he wishes to quit the robbery game and settle down with his family, suggesting that Pope join him and the pair take up stock investment. As Baz goes to leave, he is encountered by police. After telling the police that Pope has left, the police shoot Baz dead.The tension between the family and the Police explodes, and soon J is asked to steal a car and bring it to the middle of a road. J complies, and two policemen are drawn to the scene, where they are ambushed and killed by Pope and Darren.The next day, Pope, Darren and J are arrested and taken in for questioning where J meets Senior Police Officer Nathan Leckie (who also leads the armed robbery squad), who takes interest in J's situation and seeks to relieve him from it. The three are later released from custody.Later, J is arrested by Officer Leckie for underage drinking and is taken to a hotel for temporary housing.

A:","output":"\\"Underworld Kin: Ties That Bind\\" The movie title \\"Underworld Kin: Ties That Bind\\" encapsulates the central plot elements of this intense crime drama. Focused on the story of Joshua \\"J\\" Cody, who is connected by blood to a notorious Melbourne crime family led by his estranged grandmother Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the film explores the relationships and loyalties within a family embroiled in a dangerous life of crime. The word \\"Underworld\\" is an appropriate choice for this title, as the characters in the film reside in a world where crime and violence are the norm. As J navigates this new life and comes to learn the roles of his family members, the title suggests a world that exists beneath the surface of everyday life, one ruled by dark and dangerous figures who go to great lengths to protect their kin. The term \\"Kin\\" highlights the strong family element in the film and allows the audience to quickly understand that this story is centered around a family dynamic. The 'J' character is forced into living with his estranged grandmother and three uncles who all partake in criminal activities. It emphasizes that these blood relationships will be at the core of the film's story, driving much of the action and character development. Lastly, \\"Ties That Bind\\" is a fitting subtitle for the movie, as the phrase refers to that which holds people together, often with a sense of obligation or duty. In this case, the ties that bind the main character, J, to his unconventional family may be that of blood, shared history, and the secrets they hold together - including the acts of violence, criminality, and betrayal that occur throughout the story. This title, \\"Underworld Kin: Ties That Bind,\\" not only alludes to the central plot and themes of the film but also offers a sense of intrigue and tension while promising a story that dives deep into the struggles and relationships within a twisted and dangerous crime family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Can you tell me the answer to who gave famous state subject law to the state of j&k??","output":"The famous state subject law in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was given by Maharaja Hari Singh, the last ruling Maharaja of the princely state of J&K, in 1927. The law, also known as the Jammu and Kashmir State Subject Law, was initially introduced as the Notification No. 1-L/84. Maharaja Hari Singh ascended to the throne in 1925 and, during his reign, he faced several challenges, including social, economic, and political issues. One of the key concerns was the protection of the rights and privileges of the indigenous people of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly regarding land ownership, employment, and political participation. The primary motive behind the introduction of the state subject law was to shield the state's residents from the influx of outsiders who sought to exploit the state's resources and opportunities. This law defined specific criteria to categorize individuals as \\"state subjects,\\" which are as follows: 1. Class I: Individuals born or settled in the state before March 31, 1887, and their descendants. 2. Class II: Individuals who settled in the state between March 31, 1887, and March 16, 1920, and held immovable property. 3. Class III: Individuals who have settled in the state after acquiring immovable property under a valid grant or title before March 16, 1920. 4. Class IV: Individuals who have permanently settled in the state after March 16, 1920, on a valid permit issued by the government and continuously residing in the state for a period of not less than ten years. Those categorized as state subjects were granted specific privileges and rights, including: 1. Acquiring immovable property 2. Obtaining government employment 3. Participating in state legislative assemblies and local bodies 4. Access to state scholarships, grants, and aids In 1947, after India gained independence and the partition of India and Pakistan took place, Maharaja Hari Singh decided to accede the state of J&K to the Dominion of India, signing the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947. The state subject law continued to exist within the newly formed Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, with certain modifications over time, such as the replacement of the term \\"state subjects\\" with \\"permanent residents.\\" The state subject law, in the context of the larger political framework of Jammu and Kashmir, was altered on August 5, 2019, when the Government of India abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special autonomy and self-governance rights to the state. Alongside the abrogation, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act was passed, which bifurcated the state into two union territories—Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This change effectively revoked the state subject law, transitioning the region's legal and administrative framework to match the rest of the country's constitutional provisions, effectively bringing about significant changes in property rights, employment, and political participation in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. From the carton, I took three eggs and inspected them for cracks. They looked fine, so I cracked them into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in it. I added a splash of water and then began to scramble the eggs with a whisk. Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in it. Once the pan was hot, I poured my eggs in it. After adding a dash of salt and pepper, I kept scrambling the eggs. Occasionally i would remove the pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment. Once the eggs looks firm and ready, I turned off the stove and plated my eggs to enjoy. I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make it look even fancier.  Question: Who was going to eat the scrambled eggs?

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"What was the result of following terrorist money flowing from point A to point B?\\" Answer: \\"CIA found it was hard to attack funds of Al Qaeda\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. The CIA found it difficult to attack the funds of the clandestine organization Al Qaeda by simply following the money from point A to point B.

Clarkson's debut single, \\"A Moment Like This\\", topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became the best-selling single of 2002 in the US. It was followed by the release of her debut studio album, Thankful (2003), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Clarkson has scored 100 number ones on the Billboard charts and sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide, including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone. She became the first artist to top each of Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, adult pop, country and dance charts. She was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Television channel Fuse included Clarkson among \\"30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions\\" list. Music executive Simon Cowell believed that \\"What [Clarkson] sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do with American Idol.

Kelly writes that Trump was livid the day before the first debate of the Republican primary campaign after he heard that Kelly's planned first question \\"was a very pointed question directed at him,\\" The Times reports. \\"This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women,\\" The Times wrote. While she doesn't delve into who might have leaked the question, the book gives the clear impression that former Fox New CEO Roger Ailes and others within the network \\"seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee,\\" according to The Times.      Kelly went on Twitter late Thursday to shoot down the inference that the question was leaked.      For the record, my book \\"Settle for More\\" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016      Kelly also wrote that on the day of the debate, what The Times describes as an \\"overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver\\" drove her to the event and insisted on making her coffee. She writes that she drank it and then was violently ill within 15 minutes, according to The Times. \\"Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her,\\" The Times reported. (A stomach bug was going around, she notes.) But the episode spooked her enough that she shared it later with Roger Ailes and a lawyer friend of his. Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide.\\"      Again, Kelly took to Twitter to clarify her position. \\"Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did,\\" she wrote at midnight Thursday.      Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016      There is one passage of The Times report Kelly has not yet disputed. Before the debate, Kelly did a piece on her show The Kelly File about Trump that the businessman did not like. According to Kelly, Trump refused to make a scheduled appearance on her show unless she called him, The Times reports.      “I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you,” she says Trump told her, according to The Times, \\"and I still may.\\"      Trump followed through with his threat after the debate, repeatedly insulting her with terms such as \\"bimbo\\" and \\"lightweight reporter.\\" He also implied her question at the debate was somehow tied to menstruation. \\"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever,\\" he said in a CNN interview with Don Lemon.      A report last week from Radar Online, which also says it obtained a copy of the book, detailed Kelly's allegations of sexual harassment against Ailes.

In the review, The Times states that Kelly implies that someone might have leaked her first debate question to Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary campaign. The review also suggests that Kelly may have thought she was poisoned the morning of the debate. However, Kelly disputes these two characterizations. In her memoir, Kelly writes that Trump was angry the day before the first debate when he heard that her first question would be directed at him and his history of using disparaging language about women. While Kelly did not delve into who might have leaked the question, The Times interpreted the book to imply that former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and others within the network seemed to be colluding with Trump. Kelly responded to this on Twitter, stating that her book does not suggest Trump had any debate questions in advance, nor does she believe that he did. Regarding the alleged poisoning incident, Kelly wrote that she believed she contracted a stomach virus on the day of the debate, just like Senator Rand Paul. In the memoir, Kelly also shares her experience of being insulted and threatened by Trump on Twitter, following a piece she did on her show, The Kelly File, which Trump did not like. Trump later went on to use terms like \\"bimbo\\" and \\"lightweight reporter\\" to refer to Kelly on social media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What are some powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India?","output":"Although the two questions appear similar, they have subtle differences in their focus and context. Let's first understand the meaning and intention behind each question before delving into a comprehensive response. 1. What are some of the popular WikiLeaks about India? This question seeks to know the popular or widely-discussed WikiLeaks releases that are specifically related to India. \\"Popular\\" implies that the leaks gained significant media attention, public interest, or had considerable impact on India and its people in general. Popular leaks might not necessarily be limited to issues of power or politics but could encompass various aspects of Indian society. 2. What are some powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India? This question, on the other hand, focuses on the impactful or influential WikiLeaks releases pertaining to India. \\"Powerful\\" denotes that these leaks have had significant or far-reaching consequences on Indian politics, government, or the nation's image. The focus here lies mainly on the gravity and magnitude of the leaks rather than their popularity quotient. While there might be an overlap between the popular and powerful leaks, the differentiating factor is the emphasis on the impact and significant consequences in the latter. Now that we have distinguished the two questions let's discuss both popular and powerful WikiLeaks releases concerning India. Popular WikiLeaks about India: 1. Indian Swiss Bank Account Holders: WikiLeaks disclosed a list of Indians holding Swiss bank accounts, which fueled a massive debate on black money and corruption in India. The list exposed politicians, businessmen, and others allegedly involved in stashing unaccounted money in Swiss banks. 2. Radia Tapes: The Radia Tapes exposed the close nexus between powerful Indian journalists, politicians, and corporate lobbyists. These tapes contained recorded telephone conversations between the lobbyist Niira Radia and various influential individuals, revealing corruption and manipulation in Indian media and politics. Powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India: 1. US Diplomatic cables on India: A series of diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on the American perspective of Indian politics, government, policies, and internal matters. These cables revealed sensitive information on India’s diplomatic relations, domestic politics, and military strategy, impacting India’s international standing and exposing the private opinions of Indian politicians. 2. Cash-for-votes Scandal: The WikiLeaks cables reported the alleged bribery that took place during a no-confidence motion against the Indian government in 2008. The cables exposed a conversation between a US political counselor and an Indian politician, stating that 4 opposition MPs were offered cash to save the government. This further amplified concerns regarding political corruption in India. While there is an overlap between popular and powerful leaks in this case, it is essential to note that the emphasis for popular leaks centers on capturing public interest in a broad sense, while powerful leaks stress the consequences and impact on India's politics, governance, and national image."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding for Obamacare. Then Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas joined the other 99 senators from both parties in voting Wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expected to do just that. The rare 100-0 vote on a procedural step means the spending measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown next week now can be amended by Senate Democrats to restore funding for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms, which had been eliminated last week by House Republicans. Cruz led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block Senate consideration of the spending legislation because Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear his caucus would remove the provision that defunded Obamacare. Cruz's OPTIONS: - Barack Obama critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Cruz critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Democratic critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - GOP critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Harry Reid critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - House Republicans critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Marathon critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Obamacare critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Republican critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Senate critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Senate Democrats critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Senate Majority Leader Reid critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Ted Cruz critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. - Texas critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House.","output":"In this story, Ted Cruz critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. Despite his seemingly futile efforts, Senator Ted Cruz remained undeterred in his passionate opposition to Obamacare. The Texas Republican's actions led to serious criticism and questioning of his political strategy. Critics argued that attempting to stop Obamacare through government funding measures was politically suicidal for Cruz, as the Democrats maintained control of the Senate, and President Barack Obama himself had a vested interest in preserving his flagship healthcare reform. As the weeks went on, the Senate Democrats indeed worked to restore the funding stripped away by the House Republicans, largely thanks to Majority Leader Harry Reid's leadership. Reid dismissed Cruz's tactics as more of a political stunt than a genuine attempt to enact change. This view was similarly echoed by some members within Cruz's party, leading to divisions and debate on their approach to healthcare reform. Throughout the country, differing views on Obamacare led to heated discussions among citizens. The partisan divide grew deeper, with supporters of the healthcare law praising its provisions and accessibility, while detractors cited its high costs, bureaucracy, and negative impact on businesses and employment. The national conversation on healthcare reform became more polarized than ever, with each side attempting to present their views as the most sensible and beneficial for the American people. In the end, despite the fierce opposition by Senator Cruz and his conservative allies, they were unable to change the trajectory of Obamacare due to the political reality of the Democratic-controlled Senate and Obama's unwavering dedication to his healthcare program. The effort by Cruz eventually came to be seen as politically damaging, not only to his own standing but also to the Republican party as a whole. Cruz's critics rejoiced in the inability of the Texas Senator to change the course of the ACA. However, the passionate debates and the determination of Cruz and his fellow conservatives planted seeds of doubt and controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act that would linger for years to come, fueling future legislative attempts and reform discussions. Their tireless battle against Obamacare served as a constant reminder of the deeply ingrained political divide within the United States, and the seemingly unending struggle to find a common ground on the future of American healthcare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative.  The reviewer is expressing a strong sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the film. This is evident from the outright statement in the initial sentence, \\"I'm sorry but this is just awful\\". The criticism is founded on several aspects, but primarily the acting and writing in the film.  The reviewer mentions \\"bad acting\\" as one of the fundamental issues with the film, which indicates their displeasure with the performances. They also underscore their incredulousness as they recount sharing about the film with others who almost don't believe the extent of the criticized acting. This emphasizes their negative sentiment and an underlying sense of disappointment. The dialogue used in the film is another significant factor contributing to the reviewer's negative sentiment. They provide an example dialogue, \\"Hey my watch has stopped\\", presumably used recurrently in the film. Their annoyance with the dialogues' repetitiveness is expressed through the remark, \\"Imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else\\". They disapprove of the inability of the film to deliver on its interesting premise. The concept of modern Japanese troops traveling back in time to the days of Busido warriors is seen as a great idea but the execution is viewed as disappointing, as can be inferred from \\"There is nothing wrong with the idea... with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything.\\" Lastly, the phrase \\"you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell,\\" clearly summarizes their overall negative sentiment about the film. They convey their disappointment with how the film, despite a promising premise, failed to deliver greatness due to issues with the acting and dialogue.  To conclude, observing the language and tone used in the review, from this analysis, it can be stated that the overall sentiment of the review is strongly negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"State funeral held for Poland's first post-communist prime minister\\"","output":"Title: State Funeral Held for Poland's First Post-Communist Prime Minister  On a somber day in Polish history, thousands of people gathered in the heart of Warsaw to pay their respects to the man instrumental in shaping Poland's transition from communism to democracy: Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the nation's first post-communist prime minister. Dignitaries, politicians, and citizens braved the chilly weather, united in their grief and appreciation for the man who led the nation through a tumultuous period.  Born in 1927, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was a revered figure who had devoted his life to the cause of democracy and human rights. Initially a lawyer and journalist, Mazowiecki became a prominent political activist in the 1970s and founding member of Solidarity, the trade union that played a crucial role in the eventual collapse of communism in Poland. In 1989, after decades-long struggle between the communist regime and the pro-democracy opposition, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was chosen as the first non-communist prime minister since the end of World War II. Serving with steadfast dedication, he guided the country from a failing centrally-planned economy to a market-driven one, laying the foundations of modern Poland as we know it today. At the beginning of the state funeral, held in the historic St. John's Archcathedral, Archbishop of Warsaw, Kazimierz Nycz, delivered an emotional homily, highlighting Mazowiecki's unwavering commitment to democracy, social justice, and reconciliation. \\"Tadeusz Mazowiecki, our prime minister, and our compatriot, was subjected to great trials but never lost hope,\\" Archbishop Nycz said. \\"His entire life was a struggle for a just and free Poland, a struggle against hatred and discrimination.\\" The funeral was attended by numerous political leaders and European dignitaries, including Poland's President Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Beata Szydło, and former presidents Lech Wałęsa and Bronisław Komorowski. Representatives from across the European Union and beyond had come to celebrate Mazowiecki's legacy of unwavering commitment to democracy and human rights. During the ceremony, words of remembrance were shared by members of Mazowiecki's family and friends. As President Duda offered his eulogy, he underscored the prime minister's pivotal role in shaping the nation: \\"It is not an overstatement to say that without Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the map of Europe would look very different today. He was instrumental in bringing the Iron Curtain down and setting Poland on the path of democracy and freedom.\\" The procession continued from St. John's Archcathedral to the historic Powązki Cemetery, where Mazowiecki was laid to rest among Poland's revered national heroes. The mournful tunes of military trumpets accompanied the procession, and streets were lined with citizens offering flowers and weeping as the hearse passed by. The state funeral of Tadeusz Mazowiecki not only served as a heartfelt tribute to Poland's first post-communist prime minister but also as a solemn reminder of how far the country has come in the last three decades. As Poland and many other former communist nations continue to grapple with the challenges and opportunities of democracy, Mazowiecki's life and political achievements stand out as a beacon of hope and an enduring symbol of resilience. The legacy of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki shall be remembered and cherished by generations to come, as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, one man's unwavering conviction in the cause of justice, freedom, and democracy can make a significant impact on the course of a nation's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If animals may compete for territory, water, food, or partners, then animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?  Answer choices: - environment  - bosses  - transportation  - vegetation  - plants  - Energy.  - partners  - energy","output":"Animals can indeed compete for territory, water, food, and partners, as these resources play a vital role in their survival, reproduction, and success. When we look at the other answer choices suggested, some are directly related to the resources mentioned, and others are not necessarily relevant for animals in their natural habitat. We can discuss these choices one by one: 1. Environment: The environment encompasses the surrounding conditions in which an animal lives and interacts. While animals do not directly compete for the environment, they can compete for territories that may have specific environmental features, like a water source or ideal nesting site. So, the competition for territory indirectly influences the animals' environment. 2. Bosses: This term is not relevant in the context of animals since it's generally associated with a human connection, like the working environment and hierarchy within an organization. 3. Transportation: Although transportation is useful to humans, it's not a resource that animals actively compete for within their natural habitat. Animals inherently have their transportation methods like walking, running, swimming, or flying. However, those mechanisms don't result in direct competition. 4. Vegetation: Vegetation serves as a source of food for herbivorous and omnivorous animals. This choice is closely related to the competition animals have over food resources, especially for species that rely on plant matter for their diet. 5. Plants: Similar to vegetation, plants are often food sources for animals. Competing for plants can be considered another aspect of animals competing for food resources. 6. Energy: Energy, in this context, might refer directly to the determination or strength animals devote to competing. While animals do not directly compete for energy, they allocate their energy in different ways through competition for territory, water, food, or partners. Alternatively, energy can be interpreted as feeding on a prey for a predator, thus implying food competition. 7. Partners: This choice is inherently included in the list of resources animals can compete for. Partners are essential for mating and reproducing, ensuring the survival and success of a species. 8. Energy (as it repeats in the list): Depending on its interpretation, it could mean animals competing for food resources or allocating their energy in various ways throughout competitions for the other resources mentioned. In conclusion, while some of the options listed, like vegetation and plants, can be related to the resources animals may compete for, other choices like bosses and transportation are not directly related. Thus, animals can compete for territory, water, food, partners, vegetation, and plants. These competitions revolve around resources that help animals survive and thrive, ensuring the continuation of their species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - In the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4. The \\"four-minute barrier\\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds. Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14 km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).  - The marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 miles, or 26 miles 385 yards), usually run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides (more correctly, Philippides), a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory.  - A world record is usually the best global performance ever recorded and officially verified in a specific skill or sport. The book \\"Guinness World Records\\" collates and publishes notable records of all types, from first and best to worst human achievements, to extremes in the natural world and beyond. The website \\"RecordSetter\\" has begun to take on the same territory, but with a more inclusive policy, as users submit videos of record attempts in order to try to receive a world record. The website \\"challengers.guinnessworldrecords.com\\" is similar to \\"RecordSetter\\", as the record attempts are judged by Guinness World Records adjudicators, but the records to attempt are provided beforehand.  - Ronald William \\"Ron\\" Clarke, AO, MBE (21 February 1937  17 June 2015) was an Australian athlete, writer, and Mayor of the Gold Coast from 2004 to 2012. He was one of the best-known middle- and long-distance runners in the 1960s, notable for setting seventeen world records.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - The 10,000 metres or 10,000-meter run is a common long-distance track running event. The event is part of the athletics programme at the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics and is common at championship level events. The race consists of 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track. It is less commonly held at track and field meetings, due to its duration. The 10,000 metres track race is usually distinguished from its road running counterpart, the 10K run, by its reference to the distance in metres rather than kilometres.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Matti Henrikki Järvinen (18 February 1909  22 July 1985) was a Finnish javelin thrower. He won the Olympic gold medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics ahead of two other Finns, Matti Sippala and Eino Penttilä, with a throw of 72.71 metres. Four of his other five throws would also have been enough to take gold. The three Finns did not take off their tracksuit trousers during the event.  - Emil Zátopek (19 September 1922  22 November 2000) was a Czechoslovak long-distance runner best known for winning three gold medals at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He won gold in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres runs, but his final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the first marathon of his life. He was nicknamed the \\"Czech Locomotive\\".  - The 1952 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Helsinki, Finland, in 1952. Helsinki had been earlier selected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to World War II. It is the northernmost city at which a summer Olympic Games have been held. It was also the Olympic Games at which the most number of world records were broken until surpassed by the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Israel, Thailand, and Saarland made their Olympic debuts in Helsinki 1952.  - A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience. A recital is a concert by a soloist or small group which follows a program, such as featuring the works of a single composer (organ recital). A recitalist is a musician who gives frequent recitals. The invention of the solo piano recital has been attributed to Franz Liszt.  - John Michael Landy (born 12 April 1930) is an Australian former Olympic track athlete. He was the second man to break the four-minute mile barrier in the mile run, and held the world records for the 1500 metre run and the mile race. He was also the 26th Governor of Victoria from 2001 to 2006.  - The javelin throw is a track and field event where the javelin, a spear about in length, is thrown. The javelin thrower gains momentum by running within a predetermined area. Javelin throwing is an event of both the men's decathlon and the women's heptathlon.  - Paavo Johannes Nurmi (13 June 1897  2 October 1973) was a Finnish middle- and long-distance runner. He was nicknamed the \\"Flying Finn\\" as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated at distances from 800 m upwards for 121 races. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 m.  - A stadium (plural stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event.  - Matti Kalervo Sippala (11 March 1908  22 August 1997) was a Finnish athlete. His main event was the javelin throw, in which he won the silver medal at both the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1934 European Championships, but he was also a good pentathlete, breaking the unofficial world record in 1931.  - The 1500 metres or 1,500-metre run (approximately  mile) is the foremost middle distance track event in athletics.

Context: Egypt, Syria and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, signed the Damascus Declaration after the 1991 Gulf War to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the Gulf region. Hypothesis: this treaty is impactful","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context In the given context, we see that Egypt, Syria, and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council signed the Damascus Declaration following the 1991 Gulf War. The purpose of this agreement was to establish a mechanism to guarantee security in the Gulf region. Step 2: Identify the key elements  Key elements in this context are the countries involved (Egypt, Syria, and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council), the timing (after the 1991 Gulf War), and the intention (to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the Gulf region). Step 3: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis being proposed is that the treaty formed by the Damascus Declaration is impactful. To assess this hypothesis, we need to consider the components of the context and their relevance to the hypothesis. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis in regards to the context For the hypothesis to be correct, the Damascus Declaration needs to have a significant impact in terms of ensuring security in the Gulf region. Since the context states that the declaration was created to guarantee security in the region, it seems plausible that the treaty might have had an effect in achieving that goal. Step 5: Consider potential counterarguments and limitations While the intent of the Damascus Declaration was to guarantee security in the Gulf region, the context does not provide information on the effectiveness or implementation of the treaty. The success and impact of this treaty could be dependent on several factors that were not mentioned in the context, such as the cooperation of all signatories, the mechanisms put in place, and how strictly those mechanisms were followed. Conclusion: Based on the context provided, we can tentatively draw the hypothesis that the Damascus Declaration treaty may have had an impact on security in the Gulf region. Although the context implies that the treaty aimed to guarantee security, it does not provide enough information about the specific mechanisms or the degree of success achieved with the declaration. Therefore, our hypothesis is only supported to a limited extent, and further information would be needed to strengthen the assertion that the Damascus Declaration treaty has been truly impactful."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the below context:  Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it.

In recent comments, Leigh Griffiths emphasized the positive side of Scotland's 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw with England, claiming it should be savoured as their first victory over their neighbouring rivals since 1999. While disappointment might linger for some fans, the spirit and intensity displayed by the players on the pitch should be considered as a moral victory for the Scottish team and highlights their growth in international football. Step 2: Discuss the match Recap the significant moments of the match, highlighting Scotland's resilience and performance. The match, which took place in June 2017, was a pulsating encounter and saw an impressive display from the Scottish team. The game featured both sides fighting tooth and nail, with goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and two superb free-kicks from Leigh Griffiths that put Scotland ahead. However, a last-minute equaliser from Harry Kane stole the victory from Scotland's grasp and resulted in a draw. Despite not securing a win, Scotland's overall performance showcased their improvement and newfound determination, particularly in key moments during the game. The energy and verve of the players were evident as they managed to surprise many by matching their more illustrious opponents' skill and determination. Step3: Analyse Griffiths' perspective Discuss Griffiths' point of view and how he views the result as a positive outcome. Leigh Griffiths, who scored both of Scotland's brilliant goals, sees the result as a signal of progress for the team. Instead of dwelling on the disappointment of a draw, he focuses on the fact that Scotland pushed a highly-rated English team to their limits and, in many respects, outplayed them in crucial moments. It is fair to view this as Scotland's first victory against England since 1999, mainly because it highlights the team's growth and potential to compete with the top teams in European football. Step 4: Address the broader implications of the result Discuss what the draw means for Scottish football and highlight its significance in the context of their World Cup qualifying campaign. The draw can also be perceived as a stepping stone for Scotland's campaign in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. While the final point tally wasn't enough for qualification into the tournament, this result against England demonstrated the team's capability to challenge the top sides. For the Scottish side, this performance might be the much-needed confidence boost that encourages them to aim higher and work persistently to ultimately succeed in future competitions. Step 5: Conclusion Sum up the main points of the article and reiterate the importance of focusing on the positives of the performance. In conclusion, while a 2-2 draw against England might not seem like an outright victory, it is a result that merits appreciation and recognition. Leigh Griffiths' outlook encourages fans and players alike to focus on the positives, such as the impressive performance and tenacity displayed by the Scottish team during the match, and use this as fuel for further growth and progress in international football. Ultimately, this draw against England should be cherished as a marker of Scotland's potential and a testament to their ability to contend with the top teams in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: oh oh they're such a nice bright early spring color Sentence 2: Their color is lovely. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, if we consider the first sentence true, the second sentence logically follows and holds true as well. Sentence 1, \\"oh oh they're such a nice bright early spring color,\\" communicates the author's admiration for a specific color, attributing positive qualities to it such as \\"nice,\\" \\"bright,\\" and associating it with the refreshing and vibrant atmosphere of \\"early spring.\\" This statement clearly indicates that the speaker holds a positive opinion about this color, appreciating its aesthetic appeal. Given the affirmation in Sentence 1, Sentence 2, \\"Their color is lovely,\\" follows suit. This sentence is a less detailed expression of similar sentiment. The term \\"lovely\\" signifies an appreciation for beauty or attractiveness, which is in line with the adjectives used in Sentence 1. In both cases, the speaker is expressing their fondness and appreciation for the color, effectively showing that if the first statement is valid, the second statement is also valid. In conclusion, if one accepts the first sentence as true, the second sentence is undeniably true as well. Both sentences convey a positive opinion about the particular color being referred to, and their compatibility highlights the consistency in the speaker's viewpoint."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],q={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
