It is primarily composed of gas, dust, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields. Here are some key points about the interstellar medium: 1. Gas: The ISM is predominantly made up of gas, mostly in the form of atomic hydrogen (H I) and molecular hydrogen (H2). Other elements like helium, carbon, and oxygen are also present, albeit in smaller quantities. 2. Dust: Interstellar dust consists of tiny particles, typically less than a micrometer in size. These particles are composed of various materials such as carbon, silicates, and metallic compounds. Dust grains play a crucial role in the formation of stars and planets as they act as a catalyst for the creation of molecules. 3. Cosmic Rays: Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from various sources, including supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Although cosmic rays make up a small fraction of the interstellar medium\'s mass, they have a significant impact on the environment and can influence the chemistry of the ISM. 4. Magnetic Fields: Magnetic fields permeate the interstellar medium, exerting control over the dynamics and behavior of the gas and dust. They play a crucial role in various processes, such as the creation of stars, as they can shape the flow of material and induce turbulence. 5. Density and Temperature: The interstellar medium\'s density can vary significantly, ranging from regions with high-density molecular clouds to more diffuse regions with lower densities. Similarly, the temperature can vary from cold regions with temperatures near absolute zero to hotter regions influenced by stellar activity, with temperatures reaching millions of degrees. 6. Star Formation: The interstellar medium is the site of star formation. Dense regions within the ISM, called molecular clouds, can collapse under the force of gravity, leading to the birth of new stars. Interstellar dust helps protect these forming stars from intense radiation and facilitates the process of accretion. 7. Interaction and Evolution: The interstellar medium is dynamic and undergoes constant interaction and exchange of matter and energy. This includes processes like supernovae explosions, stellar winds, and the injection of material by dying stars. These interactions shape the structure and evolution of galaxies over cosmic timescales. Understanding the interstellar medium is crucial for studying the life cycle of galaxies, the formation of stars and planetary systems, and the overall composition of the universe. Various observational and theoretical studies are conducted to gain insights into its properties and processes."},{"instruction":"What are the dangers in that part of space","output":"While the interstellar medium itself may not possess immediate dangers to human life, there are several hazards associated with traversing or operating within this region. Here are a few potential dangers in space: 1. Cosmic Radiation: Cosmic rays, consisting of high-energy particles, including protons and atomic nuclei, pose a significant hazard. These particles can penetrate spacecraft and pose health risks to astronauts, potentially leading to increased radiation exposure and an elevated risk of cancer, radiation sickness, and damage to the central nervous system. 2. Micrometeoroids: Micrometeoroids are small particles or fragments of debris that are present in space. They can be traveling at extremely high velocities and pose a collision risk to spacecraft. Even tiny particles can cause damage to spacecraft and equipment, and in extreme cases, they can penetrate the hull of a spacecraft or cause system failures. 3. Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs): Solar flares and CMEs are eruptions on the Sun\'s surface that release massive amounts of radiation and charged particles into space. These events can disrupt spacecraft electronics, communication systems, and pose radiation hazards to astronauts and sensitive electronic equipment. 4. Extreme Temperatures: In the interstellar medium, temperatures can vary widely depending on the location. In some regions, temperatures can approach absolute zero, while other areas may be heated by stellar activity. These extreme temperature variations can pose challenges to spacecraft and equipment, requiring proper insulation and protection mechanisms. 5. Interstellar Dust: Although interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the formation of stars and planets, it can also pose challenges for spacecraft. Dust particles can accumulate on surfaces, and if not properly managed, they can interfere with sensors, optics, or other equipment. 6. Magnetic Fields: Magnetic fields in space, including the interstellar medium, can affect spacecraft systems and electronics. Strong magnetic fields can induce electrical currents in spacecraft, potentially leading to system failures or interference with sensitive instruments. It\'s important to note that the dangers mentioned above are primarily related to the space environment in general, rather than specific to the interstellar medium. As of now, human exploration has been limited to our own solar system, and interstellar travel remains theoretical. Yet, understanding these hazards is crucial for astronauts, spacecraft design, and future space exploration endeavors."},{"instruction":"Asume a future where traversing this part of space becomes viable for human creaws what procuations would be theroicaly likely","output":"If traversing the interstellar medium becomes viable for human crews in the future, several precautions and measures may need to be implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of astronauts. While some of these measures are theoretical and speculative, they would aim to mitigate the potential hazards associated with interstellar travel. Here are a few theoretical precautions that could be considered: 1. Radiation Shielding: Developing advanced shielding technologies to protect astronauts from cosmic radiation would be essential. This could involve using materials with high hydrogen content, such as water or polyethylene, as they effectively attenuate radiation. Additionally, designing the spacecraft with shielding layers and safe zones would help minimize radiation exposure during the journey. 2. Propulsion Systems: Developing efficient and powerful propulsion systems is crucial for interstellar travel. Advanced propulsion technologies, such as nuclear propulsion or utilizing antimatter, could reduce the travel time, minimizing the crew\'s exposure to hazards in space. 3. Medical Countermeasures: Advancing medical countermeasures to mitigate the adverse effects of radiation exposure would be vital. This may involve developing new pharmaceuticals, radiation-protective clothing, or genetic modifications to make astronauts more resistant to radiation damage. 4. Habitat Design: Designing spacecraft habitats that can withstand the rigors of interstellar travel is crucial. Structures should be sturdy enough to withstand micrometeoroid impacts, equipped with redundant systems to handle potential failures, and provide a comfortable and sustainable environment for the crew during the lengthy journey. 5. Navigation and Communication: Ensuring accurate and reliable navigation systems for interstellar travel is essential for maintaining the crew\'s safety. Additionally, developing advanced communication technologies that can transmit and receive signals over vast distances in a timely manner would be crucial for contact with mission control and other spacecraft. 6. Life Support Systems: Developing advanced life support systems capable of recycling and purifying air, water, and waste products for extended periods would be crucial for interstellar missions. These systems would need to operate autonomously and minimize resource consumption while maintaining a healthy environment for the crew. 7. Crew Selection and Training: Selecting and training astronauts with the necessary physical and psychological capabilities for long-duration space travel would be crucial. Crew members would require extensive training in radiation mitigation, emergency procedures, as well as interdisciplinary skills to handle various tasks onboard. It\'s important to note that interstellar travel still remains a highly speculative concept, and many technological advancements would be required to make it feasible. These theoretical precautions are based on current understanding and assumptions, which may evolve as our knowledge and capabilities advance."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮到你的吗？"},{"instruction":"你好，以下是实现需求：在TensorFlow 2.3中，使用Transformer进行中文文本分类，请给出一个包含中文文本和对应分类、数据预处理、分词、向量化、训练、预测、评估及模型保存在内的完整可直接运行的例子。谢谢","output":"当然，下面是一个可供参考的TensorFlow 2.3版本中的中文文本分类的完整示例代码。在示例中，我们将使用Transformer模型对中文文本进行分类。 首先，我们需要安装TensorFlow和bert-for-tf2库。 ```python !pip install tensorflow==2.3 !pip install bert-for-tf2 ``` 接下来，导入所需的库。 ```python import tensorflow as tf import tensorflow_hub as hub from tensorflow.keras import layers import bert import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split ``` 我们使用一个由中文文本和对应分类标签组成的示例数据集。 ```python data = pd.read_csv(\'data.csv\', encoding=\'utf-8\') ``` 进行数据预处理。在这一步，我们可以执行任何我们认为必要的处理操作，如去除停用词、标点符号等。 ```python # 数据预处理步骤，根据具体需求进行修改 data[\'text\'] = data[\'text\'].apply(lambda x: x.lower()) # 将文本转换为小写 # 其他预处理步骤... ``` 将数据集划分为训练集和测试集。 ```python train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) ``` 使用BERT的Tokenizer对文本进行分词和向量化。我们使用预先训练的中文BERT模型进行向量化。 ```python # 加载BERT的Tokenizer FullTokenizer = bert.bert_tokenization.FullTokenizer # 设置BERT模型的最大输入长度 max_length = 128 # 加载BERT模型的词典 vocab_file = \'chinese_L-12_H-768_A-12/vocab.txt\' tokenizer = FullTokenizer(vocab_file=vocab_file, do_lower_case=True) # 对文本进行分词和向量化 def tokenize_text(text): tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text) tokens = tokens[:max_length-2] # 去除超过最大长度的部分 tokens = [\'[CLS]\'] + tokens + [\'[SEP]\'] input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens) input_ids = input_ids + [0] * (max_length - len(input_ids)) return input_ids # 应用分词和向量化到数据集 train[\'input_ids\'] = train[\'text\'].apply(tokenize_text) test[\'input_ids\'] = test[\'text\'].apply(tokenize_text) # 转换为NumPy数组格式 X_train = np.array(train[\'input_ids\'].tolist()) y_train = np.array(train[\'label\'].tolist()) X_test = np.array(test[\'input_ids\'].tolist()) y_test = np.array(test[\'label\'].tolist()) ``` 构建和训练Transformer模型。 ```python # 创建Transformer模型结构 def create_model(): input_word_ids = tf.keras.Input(shape=(max_length,), dtype=tf.int32, name=\\"input_word_ids\\") bert_layer = hub.KerasLayer(\\"chinese_L-12_H-768_A-12\\", trainable=True) _, sequence_output = bert_layer([input_word_ids,]) clf_output = sequence_output[:, 0, :] out = layers.Dense(2, activation=\'softmax\')(clf_output) model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_word_ids, outputs=out) model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(), metrics=[\'accuracy\']) return model model = create_model() # 训练模型 model.fit( X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), batch_size=32, epochs=10 ) ``` 使用训练好的模型进行预测。 ```python # 预测 predictions = model.predict(X_test) predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) ``` 评估模型性能。 ```python # 评估模型 accuracy = np.mean(predicted_labels == y_test) print(\\"Accuracy:\\", accuracy) ``` 最后，保存训练好的模型。 ```python # 保存模型 model.save(\'transformer_model.h5\') ``` 这就是一个完整的在TensorFlow 2.3中使用Transformer进行中文文本分类的示例代码。你可以根据自己的需求进行相应的修改和调整。"},{"instruction":"data = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’, encoding=‘utf-8’)这里面的data.csv文件内容可以提供吗？谢谢","output":"很抱歉，作为一个语言模型，我无法提供特定的文件内容。你可以创建一个包含中文文本和对应分类的CSV文件，并将其命名为\\"data.csv\\"。确保文件的编码为UTF-8，以便正确读取。你可以根据自己的需求，随机生成或使用现有数据来填充CSV文件。在示例代码中，我们只是使用了一个假设的\\"data.csv\\"数据文件来演示代码的运行流程。你可以根据自己的实际数据和分类任务进行相应的更改和调整。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Чем я могу помочь?"},{"instruction":"чем программирование игр отличается от обычного программирования","output":"Программирование игр отличается от обычного программирования своим специфическим набором задач и требований. Вот некоторые отличительные особенности программирования игр: 1. Графика и визуализация: игровые программы обычно требуют создания и управления графическими элементами, такими как спрайты, текстуры, анимации и эффекты. Кодирование графической части игры может потребовать использования специализированных библиотек и стандартов для работы с 3D-моделями и рендерингом. 2. Управление пользователем: игры обычно включают интерактивность и реакцию на действия пользователя. Это может включать обработку клавиатуры, мыши, сенсорных экранов или других устройств ввода. Определение логики управления и обработки ввода является важной частью программирования игр. 3. Физика и симуляция: многие игры требуют симуляции физики, чтобы обеспечить реалистичность и взаимодействие объектов. Это может включать расчеты гравитации, столкновения, движения и других физических эффектов, которые нужно учесть и взаимодействовать с графикой и управлением игры. 4. Аудио и звуковые эффекты: игры также могут иметь собственные звуковые эффекты и музыку. Реализация звукового движка, управление звуковыми файлами и их воспроизведение может быть частью процесса программирования игр. 5. Игровая логика и искусственный интеллект: программа игры должна иметь логику и правила, которые определяют игровой процесс, включая поведение противников, искусственного интеллекта и системы искусственного интеллекта. 6. Оптимизация и производительность: поскольку игры требуют обработки большого количества данных и выполнения сложных вычислений в реальном времени, оптимизация производительности является важной частью программирования игр. Это может включать оптимизацию кода, управление памятью и использование параллельных вычислений. В целом, программирование игр требует особенного подхода и знаний, чтобы учесть все эти аспекты и создать интерактивный и веселый игровой опыт."},{"instruction":"что известно о Unity 3d/Unreal Engine","output":"Unity 3D и Unreal Engine - это две из самых популярных и мощных игровых движков, используемых для создания игр и других интерактивных приложений.

В итоге становится известно, что титаны появились из-за научного эксперимента, проведенного людьми в прошлом, и они были использованы как оружие в войне. Главный герой, Эрен Йегер, оказывается ключевой фигурой в реализации плана, направленного на уничтожение титанов. В финале манги \\"Атака Титанов\\", многие персонажи умирают, в том числе и некоторые главные герои. Происходит окончательное сражение между людьми и титанами, и в результате мир встает на новые рельсы, но по цене множественных жертв. В конце манги показывается, как мир начинает восстанавливаться, и хотя горечь и потери настолько ощутимы, власть положена в руки нового поколения, что дает надежду на благополучное будущее. В целом, финал манги \\"Атака Титанов\\" оставляет открытыми некоторые вопросы и некоторую долю неопределенности, но при этом завершает основные сюжетные линии и благополучно раскрывает судьбу героев.

While Imaethyr exists solely within the realm of imagination and is not an actual material, its description as an iridescent, viscous, and fractal liquid with ever-changing and multicolored properties represents its symbolic connection to creativity, inspiration, and limitless possibilities."},{"instruction":"подробно объясни мне работу этого кода procedure TMyGraphic.Paint; const n = 60; var i: Integer; h, x: real; begin PointsFromFile(FPath); h := (x2 - x1) / n; with Canvas do begin Rectangle(0, 0, Width, Height); MoveTo(Convert_x(x1), Convert_y(0)); LineTo(Convert_x(x2), Convert_y(0)); MoveTo(Convert_x(0), Convert_y(y1)); LineTo(Convert_x(0), Convert_y(y2)); x := x1; MoveTo(Convert_x(x), Convert_y(F(x))); for i := 1 to n do begin x := x + h; LineTo(Convert_x(x), Convert_y(F(x))); end; end; end;","output":"Этот код относится к методу \\"Paint\\" класса \\"TMyGraphic\\". Он выполняет отрисовку графика на холсте (Canvas). В начале определены константа \\"n\\" и переменная \\"i\\". Константа \\"n\\" определяет количество отрезков, на которые будет разбит интервал между \\"x1\\" и \\"x2\\". Переменная \\"i\\" используется в цикле для итерации по отрезкам. Затем вызывается функция \\"PointsFromFile(FPath)\\", которая загружает координаты точек графика из файла. Далее определяется величина шага \\"h\\", которая равна разности между \\"x2\\" и \\"x1\\", деленной на \\"n\\". Далее используя объект \\"Canvas\\", который представляет собой холст для рисования, выполняется отрисовка прямоугольника, ограничивающего график, с координатами (0, 0, Width, Height). Затем с помощью метода \\"MoveTo\\" устанавливаются начальные координаты для рисования осей x и y. Значение координат для оси x преобразуется с помощью функции \\"Convert_x\\", а значение координаты для оси y преобразуется с помощью функции \\"Convert_y\\". Затем переменной \\"x\\" присваивается значение \\"x1\\" и с помощью метода \\"MoveTo\\" устанавливаются начальные координаты для рисования графика. Координаты также преобразуются с помощью функций \\"Convert_x\\" и \\"Convert_y\\". Затем в цикле от \\"i\\" равной 1 до \\"n\\" переменная \\"x\\" увеличивается на шаг \\"h\\" и с помощью метода \\"LineTo\\" рисуется линия, соединяющая предыдущую точку с новой точкой графика на каждом шаге. Также координаты преобразуются с помощью функций \\"Convert_x\\" и \\"Convert_y\\". Конструкция \\"with\\" используется для обращения к методам и свойств объекта \\"Canvas\\" без необходимости повторного указания имени объекта. Таким образом, данный код выполняет отрисовку графика на холсте, используя заданные точки и интервал."},{"instruction":"За что здесь отвечают точки x1, x2, y1, y2, которые я беру из текстового файла","output":"Точки x1, x2, y1, y2, которые вы берете из текстового файла, определяют границы координатной системы, внутри которой будет отрисовываться график. Значение x1 определяет начальную координату по оси x, а значение x2 определяет конечную координату по оси x. Аналогично, значение y1 определяет начальную координату по оси y, а значение y2 определяет конечную координату по оси y. При рисовании графика, оси x и y будут отображаться на холсте от координат (0, 0) до координат (Width, Height), где \\"Width\\" и \\"Height\\" - это ширина и высота холста соответственно. При вызове функции \\"Convert_x\\" и \\"Convert_y\\" в методе \\"Paint\\", значения x и y преобразуются с помощью формул, чтобы соответствовать размерам и масштабу холста. Это обеспечивает корректное отображение графика внутри заданных границ координатной системы."},{"instruction":"А при самом рисовании графика какую роль они играют","output":"При самом рисовании графика значения x1, x2, y1, y2 используются для определения начальных и конечных координат осей x и y на холсте.

With the goal of acquiring high-value assets, the 76ers decided to trade some of their role players for the draft rights to Latvian sensation, Kristaps Porzingis. The trade was met with mixed reactions across the league, as the 76ers gave up key contributors in exchange for a relatively unknown prospect. However, the team’s front office had done their homework on Porzingis and believed in his immense potential. As the season progressed, Porzingis quickly justified the faith placed in him by the Sixers organization. Displaying exceptional versatility for his size, the Latvian frontcourt player showcased a unique skill set that propelled him to the forefront of the league’s top rookies.

Вчера я с помощью суперклея закрепил неодимовый магнит от жесткого диска на копьютерном кулере 12 Вольт. Проблема в том, что во время вращения магнит куда-то исчез и я нигде ине могу его найти, будто он улетел в другое пространство-время","output":"Здравствуйте! К сожалению, я могу только предположить, что магнит сорвался со своего места во время вращения кулера и, возможно, отскочил от какой-то поверхности. Вероятно, он улетел в сторону, которую вы не заметили. Рекомендую вам провести тщательный осмотр окружающего пространства, особенно в том месте, где вы работали с магнитом. Проверьте пол, стол, любые близлежащие предметы, чтобы убедиться, что магнит не прилип к чему-то. Иногда магниты также могут притягивать к себе металлические предметы, так что стоит проверить окружающие вас поверхности. Если вы не можете найти магнит, важно быть осторожным при работе с компьютерными компонентами в будущем, чтобы избежать подобных ситуаций."},{"instruction":"Нет я уже провел осмотр пространства, но его нигде нет. Дело в том что магнит вращался в закрытом пространстве вообще, и он вращался по кругу а улетел вверх. Его вектор движения не соответствовал вектору, который ему сообщал куллер","output":"Я понимаю ваше беспокойство. Если магнит исчез, возможно, он улетел настолько далеко или попал в недоступное место, что его сложно обнаружить. В таком случае рекомендую: 1. Тщательно проверить окружающие предметы еще раз, в том числе под мебелью, за шкафами и на других поверхностях, где магнит мог скрыться. 2. Использовать магнитный детектор или металлодетектор, если доступны, чтобы помочь обнаружить магнит. Они могут помочь определить место его нахождения, даже если он находится где-то не видно. 3. Возможно, стоит проверить верхнюю часть кулера и его лопасти, потому что магнит мог пристать к ним или под ними. 4. Если вы не можете найти магнит или он был потерян, важно быть осторожным и избегать подобных ситуаций в будущем, чтобы избежать возможных проблем с компьютерной системой или другими устройствами."},{"instruction":"Нет я уже проверил его нигде нет. Дверь в комнату была закрыта в то время, кулер вращался очень медленно (это был кулер на 2 Вт) со скоростью пары оборотов в секунду самый максимум. Магнит же весил около 30-50 грамм и был довольно массивным. Потом магнит отлетел в сторону двери. Но в комнате относительный порядок. Дверь была закрытой, и рядом с дверью на полу никаких предметов не лежит (кроме проводов), а мебель не имеет ниш для стойки (стоит прямо на полу) но его там нет","output":"Понимаю ваше объяснение ситуации. Если магнит не находится вокруг вас или в месте, где вы работали с ним, то возможно он ушел дальше или попал в место, куда вы пока не заглядывали. В таком случае, я могу предложить вам еще несколько идей: 1. Проверьте окна и вентиляционные отверстия в комнате. Возможно, магнит выбросило через окно или он проник в вентиляционную систему. 2. Если у вас есть сильный магнит или магнитный стержень, можете использовать его, чтобы пройтись по полу и стенам. Если новый магнит находится рядом, он может притянуться. 3. Рассмотрите возможность поиска магнита с помощью магнитных детекторов или экспертов, специализирующихся на поиске потерянных предметов. 4. Если вы все еще не можете найти магнит, возможно, он попал вблизи вентиляционной системы или в другое устройство. Если это произошло, рекомендую обратиться к специалисту, чтобы он провел более тщательный осмотр и выяснил, куда магнит мог уйти. В любом случае, будьте осторожны с использованием сильных магнитов в будущем, чтобы избежать подобных ситуаций."},{"instruction":"Нет вентиляционной системы нет. Я последний раз повторяю. Команата почти пустая. В ней наведен относительный порядок. Кулер с магнитом лежал на полу и был заключен в пенопилистрироловый контейнер. Вентиляции в комнате не было, окна и двери были закрытыми. Большая часть предметов лежат на столах, а другие предметы лежат в коробках, так что магнит нельзя не заметить (он довольно крупный, около 3 см по большему измерению). И он буквально улетучился.......","output":"Понимаю, что ситуация вызывает у вас смятение. В данном случае, если магнит так исчез и вы не можете его найти, есть некоторые возможные объяснения: 1. Возможно, магнит прилип к какой-то поверхности, которую вы пока не проверили. Рекомендую внимательно проверить столы, другие поверхности и предметы в комнате, особенно металлические и магнитные, вдоль пола и стен. 2. Существует возможность, что магнит отскочил от какой-то поверхности и улетел в место, которое находится за пределами комнаты или недоступно для вас. В таком случае, вам может потребоваться помощь профессионала для более тщательного обследования окружающей среды. 3. Возможно, магнит находится под каким-то предметом или скрыт в каком-то узком промежутке, который вы не заметили. Рекомендую проверить углы и щели между предметами, а также использовать освещение или зеркало, чтобы помочь вам найти магнит. Если вы исключили все возможные места, где магнит мог бы скрыться, и продолжаете не находить его, возможно, следует принять, что магнит утерян. В таком случае, будьте внимательны при работе с магнитами в будущем, чтобы избежать подобных ситуаций."},{"instruction":"Если Вам интересно еще продолжать, то все таки можно добится уменьшения веса системы путем вращения магнита но это не точно. Дело в том что куллер был присоединен к пенопилистиролу, который должен был гасить вибрацию и он же снизу закрывал воздушный поток от куллера, который не мог раскрутится до полных оборотов. Когда магнит вращался на куллере, то и лист пенополистирола и куллеры начинали приподниматься над поверхностью пола и вращались. Возможно это был эффект гироскопа","output":"Да, возможно вращение магнита на кулере создавало эффект гироскопа и приводило к поднятию листа пенополистирола и самого кулера. Это может объяснить, почему магнит перестал быть на своем месте. Однако следует отметить, что магниты разного типа и размера могут иметь разное воздействие на систему и не всегда приводят к поднятию или изменению веса компонентов. Также важно учитывать, что гироскопические эффекты влияют на систему и могут изменять ее стабильность и работоспособность. Если вы хотите добиться уменьшения веса системы, возможно, стоит рассмотреть другие методы, такие как использование легких материалов или изменение конструкции кулера, чтобы достичь желаемого эффекта без потери магнита. Как и ранее, рекомендую быть осторожным и осмотрительным при работе с компьютерными компонентами, чтобы избежать потери или повреждения важных деталей."},{"instruction":"Сильное увлечение работой, которое порой мешает делать перерывы одним словорм как называапется","output":"Этот феномен называется \\"работоголизмом\\"."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The code is wrapped inside a jQuery (function() { ... }) statement, which ensures that the code executes only after the page has finished loading. 2. The Quagga library is used to create a ResultCollector object with specific configurations. The ResultCollector is responsible for storing and filtering the results of barcode scanning. 3. The App object is defined, which contains various functions and properties related to the barcode scanner functionality. 4. The init function of the App object is called, which initializes the Quagga library and starts the barcode scanner. 5. The handleError function logs any errors that occur during initialization or scanning. 6. The checkCapabilities function retrieves the capabilities of the active camera track and adjusts the visibility of certain settings accordingly. 7. The updateOptionsForMediaRange function updates the options of a select element based on a given range. 8. The applySettingsVisibility function determines the visibility of a setting based on its capability. 9. The initCameraSelection function initializes the camera selection dropdown menu by enumerating the available video devices and populating the dropdown options. 10. The attachListeners function attaches event listeners to various elements on the page, such as the stop button and the reader configuration group. 11. The _printCollectedResults function retrieves the results stored in the ResultCollector and displays them on the page. 12. The _accessByPath function is a helper function used to access nested properties of an object using a dot notation path. 13. The _convertNameToState function converts a name string to a state string by capitalizing the first letter of each word. 14. The detachListeners function removes all event listeners attached in the attachListeners function. 15. The applySetting function applies a specific setting to the active camera track based on its capability. 16. The setState function updates the state of the App object and restarts the barcode scanner with the updated state. 17. The inputMapper object is a mapping of input names to their corresponding functions for processing input values. 18. The state object contains the initial state of the barcode scanner, including the input stream constraints, the locator settings, the number of workers, the frequency, the decoder settings, and whether locating is enabled. 19. The lastResult property is used to store the last barcode result to avoid duplicate results. 20. The Quagga.onProcessed event handler is called whenever a frame is processed by the barcode scanner. It uses the Quagga.canvas API to draw overlays and highlights around detected barcodes. 21. The Quagga.onDetected event handler is called whenever a barcode is successfully detected. It retrieves the detected code and displays it on the page. 22. Finally, the App.init() function is called to initialize the barcode scanner and start scanning for barcodes."},{"instruction":"How do i push a popup message to a PC in my network.

This implies that the recent correction has taken froth out of the market, rather than pushed prices too low, suggesting they could stay subdued for a while. As the energy transition speeds up, it should give a jolt to demand. Sales of electric vehicles (EVs), which are already rising, are expected to ramp up significantly in the coming years, and each unit contains three to four times more copper than its petrol-powered peer.

A severe crunch like that envisioned by Mr Friedland could still be avoided. Most forecasting models, including the IEA’s, expect copper demand outside clean-energy uses to remain stable. Tom Price and Ben Davis of Liberum Capital, an investment bank, reckon this is unlikely, because China’s long building boom has probably ended.

(They enter the room and see an enormous creature guarding a portal.) Lilac: That must be the guardian blocking our path. We have to defeat it! Naruto: Leave it to me! Shadow Clone Jutsu! (Naruto creates multiple clones to distract the guardian, while Lilac launches her fire breath and dashes around, delivering powerful strikes.) Lilac: Naruto, now\'s our chance! Let\'s strike together! Naruto: Rasengan! Lilac: Dragon Boost! (Their combined attack strikes the guardian, causing it to crumble and disappear. The portal begins to glow, indicating their path to freedom.) Naruto: We did it, Lilac! We defeated the guardian! Lilac: Thank you, Naruto. If it weren\'t for you, I wouldn\'t have made it out of that egg. We make a great team. Naruto: Yeah, we do! Now let\'s go back to our worlds and continue protecting them. Lilac: Agreed. Goodbye, Naruto. Until we meet again! Naruto: Farewell, Lilac. Take care!

1. 选择热门板块：研究市场热点板块，关注行业新闻和市场热点事件。通常情况下，一些受关注的行业、概念和主题股票容易出现涨停。 2. 寻找涨停前兆：关注股票价格和成交量的变化，寻找潜在的涨停信号。例如，连续大幅放量上涨、突破前期高点等都可能是涨停的前兆。 3. 研究涨停板机制：了解涨停板的规则和特点，包括跌停板和涨停板的涨幅限制、交易时间等。可以通过观察和比较历史涨停股票的特征，选择合适的涨停标的。 4. 使用技术分析工具：利用技术分析工具如K线图、移动平均线等，辅助判断股票的走势和入市时机。 5. 注意市场情绪和资金流向：关注大盘指数和主力资金的动向。市场情绪高涨、资金大幅流入的时候，涨停股的出现概率较高。 需要注意的是，抓涨停属于短期交易策略，需要谨慎操作，因为涨停板机制的存在，有时候停板后的股票可能出现高位套牢的风险。同时，为了规避风险，投资者还需注意合理控制仓位、设置止盈止损点位，并严格遵守自己的投资纪律。"},{"instruction":"能举个例子吗？","output":"当然，下面是一个可能的例子来说明如何抓涨停： 假设某个市场热点是新能源汽车行业，你关注到了一家新能源汽车相关的公司A，认为它有望出现涨停。 首先，你会研究该行业的市场环境、发展前景和相关政策等，以确认该行业是否具备热点特征。 接下来，你会检查公司A的股价走势和成交量情况。如果发现该股票在近期有连续放量上涨、连续突破前期高点的趋势，那么这可能是一个涨停的前兆。 然后，你会研究涨停板机制，知道涨停板的涨幅限制是多少（通常为10%或者5%），以确定买入时机。 在等待买入时机时，你可以使用技术分析工具如K线图、移动平均线等对股价走势进行分析，辅助判断确认买入时机。 同时，关注市场情绪和资金流向。如果整个市场对新能源汽车行业充满乐观情绪，主力资金也大量涌入该行业，那么涨停股的出现概率会更高。 当你准备好买入时，需要保持谨慎，并控制好仓位和风险。一旦买入后，你可以设立止盈和止损点位，以规避风险。 请注意，这只是一个示例，实际操作投资时需结合市场情况、个人资金情况和投资经验等进行判断和决策。投资有风险，需谨慎对待。"},{"instruction":"如何知悉当前的市场热点是什么？","output":"了解当前市场热点是什么可以通过以下几种方法： 1.

who took the egg Lilac was in. Lilac would be greatly surprised and possibly confused, as she had no recollection of Anos being involved in her past or her rescue. However, she would likely appreciate the fact that he kept her safe and brought her to where she is now. Anos himself would most likely remain unfazed, as he is used to being involved in mysterious and powerful events. He would probably see it as just another part of his destiny or plans, and may even take pride in the fact that he played a role in Lilac\'s upbringing. The other characters from both series, such as Carol, Milla, and Sasha, would likely have mixed reactions. Some might be grateful to Anos for saving Lilac, while others might feel a bit uneasy or suspicious about his involvement. They would probably seek more information about his intentions and motives, as Anos is known to be a complex and enigmatic character.

And here I thought I knew everything about the creatures of Minecraft.\\" Female Ghast: \\"There\'s always more to discover in this vast world. It\'s what keeps us all intrigued and curious. Is there anything else you\'d like to know about the Nether or the creatures that reside here?\\" [player]: \\"Actually, yes. I\'ve always wondered why Ghasts are so hostile towards players. Is it because you feel threatened?\\" Female Ghast: \\"Hmm, it\'s a bit more complex than that. Ghasts are naturally protective creatures, and the Nether is our territory. We perceive any intruder as a potential threat. But I believe there\'s potential for understanding and coexistence if approached with caution and respect.\\" [player]: \\"That\'s a wise perspective. It\'s essential to respect the boundaries of all creatures and find ways to peacefully coexist. Thank you for opening my eyes to the depths of the Nether and its inhabitants.\\" Female Ghast: \\"You\'re welcome. It was a pleasure sharing this moment of contemplation with you. Safe travels, adventurer.\\" (The player nods, bidding farewell to the female Ghast, and continues their journey through the vibrant red landscape of the Nether, now with a newfound appreciation for its beauty and the creatures that dwell within.)"},{"instruction":"你是建材商场的活动策划师，请你写一篇线上宣传方案","output":"线上宣传方案：建材商场热销季 一、宣传目标： 1. 提高建材商场品牌知名度。 2. 增加线上销售量和线下到店流量。 3. 扩大目标群体，吸引更多潜在客户。 4. 强调建材商场的专业性和高品质产品。 二、宣传阶段： 1. 预热期（1周）： - 联系房地产开发商和设计师等合作伙伴，邀请他们发布建材使用案例，并在社交媒体上进行推广。提醒受众即将开始的“热销季”活动。 - 制作品牌故事视频，向受众传达建材商场的核心价值观和商场的特色。 2. 活动期（2周）： - 将建材商场的独家活动和优惠信息发布在社交媒体、公司网站和专业建材论坛等平台上。 - 利用搜索引擎优化（SEO）技术将建材商场的网站排在搜索结果的前几名，吸引更多目标受众。 - 组织线上抽奖活动，邀请受众分享建材购物心得，参与抽奖并赢取建材商场的购物券奖励。 - 举办在线建材讲座和培训课程，提供专业建材知识和选购指南。 三、宣传渠道和方式： 1. 社交媒体： - 利用微博、微信、抖音和小红书等热门社交媒体平台展示建材商场的产品和活动信息。发布短视频、图片和文字内容，吸引用户点击了解更多。 - 与房地产开发商、设计师和KOL（意见领袖）合作，在他们的社交媒体账号上进行合作推广。 2. 搜索引擎： - 在百度、谷歌等搜索引擎上购买相关关键词的广告，增加建材商场网站的曝光度。 - 编写和发布优质的建材相关内容，提高建材商场网站在搜索引擎排名中的权重。 3. 广告投放： - 在相关的房地产、家居装修和建材行业杂志、网站等媒体上刊登广告，增加品牌曝光度。 - 利用特定的城市和人群定位，投放在线广告，将建材商场的优惠信息推送给目标用户。 四、宣传内容： 1. 专业建材产品介绍： - 制作宣传视频，展示建材商场丰富的产品线和独特的设计风格。 - 编写建材产品特点和优势的文字内容，发布在官方网站和社交媒体上。 2. 优惠信息和活动通知： - 发布特价产品、打折活动和优惠券信息，吸引用户参与购物。 - 在建材商场的官方网站和社交媒体上定期更新活动进展和剩余时间的提醒。 3. 用户案例分享： - 邀请用户分享购物心得和案例展示，展示建材商场的专业性和高品质产品。 - 在社交媒体上发布用户案例，对于选购建材产品有兴趣的用户会更愿意与您联系。 五、宣传效果评估： 1. 收集和分析线上活动的数据，包括网站流量、转化率和线上销售量等。 2. 监控社交媒体上的互动和口碑，关注用户的反馈和评论。 3. 定期评估宣传策略的效果，调整活动计划和宣传内容。 通过上述线上宣传方案，建材商场能够充分利用互联网和社交媒体等线上渠道，提高品牌曝光度，吸引潜在客户，并增加线上销售和线下到店流量。同时，通过专业建材知识分享和用户案例展示，增加用户对建材商场的信任感，提升品牌形象和用户忠诚度。"},{"instruction":"从前端开发的角度出发，谈一下ChatGPT的使用方向","output":"从前端开发的角度出发，ChatGPT的使用方向可以分为以下几个方面： 1. 嵌入到聊天界面：ChatGPT可以作为一个聊天机器人插件嵌入到网页或应用程序的聊天界面中，与用户进行对话交互。前端开发人员可以通过API调用ChatGPT的模型，将用户的输入传递给模型进行处理，然后将生成的回复展示给用户。 2. 自定义用户界面：为了提供更好的用户体验，开发人员可以根据具体需求自定义ChatGPT的用户界面。可以使用HTML、CSS和JavaScript等前端技术来创建一个交互性强、易于使用的界面，通过前端开发实现与ChatGPT的交互和展示。 3. 控制对话流程：ChatGPT通常是基于序列的模型，对话的上下文是非常重要的。前端开发人员可以设计用户界面，使用户可以通过选择或点击不同的选项或按钮来控制对话的流程，将相关的上下文信息传递给ChatGPT，从而指导对话的方向。 4. 增强对话交互：ChatGPT可以用于创建虚拟助手、客服机器人等应用。通过前端开发，可以与ChatGPT集成其他服务，如数据库、API等，从而使ChatGPT能够提供更加个性化和智能化的回复。例如，在用户和ChatGPT的对话中，可以调用后端API获取用户的个人数据，以便ChatGPT提供更加个性化的回复。 5. 安全性和可控性：ChatGPT模型生成的回复是根据训练数据中的模式和信息生成的，这意味着它可能会产生不准确、误导性或不当的回答。前端开发人员可以通过过滤和审核用户输入、限制ChatGPT的回复范围和内容，以提高安全性和可控性。 总之，ChatGPT的使用方向需要前端开发人员将其嵌入到聊天界面、自定义用户界面、控制对话流程、增强对话交互，并注意安全性和可控性等方面。这些方向可以提供用户友好的交互界面和个性化的功能，为用户带来更好的使用体验。"},{"instruction":"(Dynamic crystallization resulted in grain refinement in stirred zone of friction stir processed specimens, in addition, it has been observed that increasing FSP pass number caused reducing the SZ grain size and more its uniformity)","output":"Dynamic crystallization refers to the formation of new grains during the friction stir processing (FSP) of a material. FSP involves a rotating tool that generates frictional heat, leading to localized plastic deformation and recrystallization of the material. In the stirred zone (SZ), where the tool is in direct contact with the material, dynamic crystallization occurs due to the high temperatures and severe plastic deformation. This results in the formation of smaller and more uniformly distributed grains in the SZ compared to the surrounding regions. The grain refinement in the SZ due to dynamic crystallization is further enhanced with an increasing number of FSP passes. Each pass of the tool over the material introduces additional plastic deformation and heat, promoting the formation of even finer grains. The increased uniformity of the grain size can be attributed to the accumulative effect of multiple passes, ensuring a more consistent distribution of dynamic crystallization throughout the SZ. By reducing the grain size and enhancing its uniformity, dynamic crystallization improves the mechanical properties of the processed material. The smaller grains lead to increased strength and hardness, as well as improved resistance to deformation and cracking. Additionally, the uniform grain size distribution minimizes any potential weak spots or regions of stress concentration, improving the overall structural integrity of the material."},{"instruction":"复写这句话：材质很好，质量也不错，到货也很快实物与描述的一样，质量相当好，卖家态度也好，有问必答，发货速度杠杠的，值得购买哦是正品，和实体店一样，价格还优惠，果断转粉真的很好用，对商品非常满意，属于无限回购款，推荐！","output":"该商品的材质上乘，质量可靠，而且送货速度快。实物与描述完全一致，质量相当出色。卖家的态度很好，有问必答。发货速度非常迅速，真的值得购买。这款商品是正品，和实体店的货物一样，价格还很优惠。果断成为它的粉丝，发现它真的很好用。对该商品非常满意，属于无限回购的款式，强烈推荐！"},{"instruction":"","output":"The Christmas market in Prague is one of the most popular and beautiful markets in Europe.

Transcribe the audio: Use an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system or library to convert the audio into text. You can use tools like Mozilla DeepSpeech, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, or other ASR libraries. Retrieve the transcribed text from the audio. 2. Divide the text into segments: Split the transcribed text into smaller segments based on natural breaks in the speech, such as pauses, sentence boundaries, or logical divisions. Each segment will correspond to a subtitle in the final SRT file. 3. Assign timestamps to the segments: Assign timestamps to each segment, indicating the start and end time of each subtitle. You can determine the timestamps based on the audio\'s duration or by analyzing the pace of speech. Ensure the timestamps are in the appropriate format (hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds). 4. Format the subtitles: Format the segments and timestamps in the SRT format. Typically, an SRT file consists of a numerical sequence indicating the order of the subtitles, followed by the timestamped subtitle text. Each subtitle is separated by an empty line. 5. Save the subtitles to an SRT file: Write the formatted subtitles to an SRT file, using a plain text editor or programming language. Ensure the file has a \\".srt\\" extension. Here\'s an example of how an SRT file is structured: ``` 1 00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000 This is the first subtitle. 2 00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000 This is the second subtitle. ``` Remember to handle cases where there may be overlapping speech or audio with no speech. Depending on the complexity of the audio and your requirements, additional processing and adjustments may be necessary to ensure accurate and well-timed subtitles."},{"instruction":"Can I use an existing HuggingFace AI model to create an audio to text or audio to subtitle application?","output":"Yes, you can use existing HuggingFace AI models to create an audio-to-text or audio-to-subtitle application.

To overcome this issue, you can convert the dict_values object into a list before serializing it with JSON. The list() function converts the dict_values object into a list, making it JSON serializable. Here\'s an example: ```python import json data = { \\"key1\\": {\\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"c\\"}, \\"key2\\": {\\"x\\", \\"y\\", \\"z\\"} } # Convert the \'dict_values\' object to list for key, value in data.items(): data[key] = list(value) # Serialize the modified dictionary to JSON json_data = json.dumps(data) print(json_data) ``` This code will convert the dict_values objects into lists before serializing the dictionary to a JSON string."},{"instruction":"英语语音训练实训报告，包括实训内容、收获、不足和后续学习计划","output":"实训内容： 本次英语语音训练实训主要包括声调、节奏、语速、语音语调等方面的提升。通过跟着老师的指导进行练习，包括模仿老师的读音、反复朗读文本、纠正发音错误等等。同时，还进行了各种口语对话练习，包括跟着录音对话练习、口语表达训练等。 收获： 通过这次实训，我明确了自己的英语发音问题，并且通过反复练习和纠正，逐渐改善了我的发音准确度。我学会了如何正确地使用声调和语调，使语言更加生动有趣。同时，我还加深了对英语语音规则的理解，对于一些常见的发音错误有了更深刻的认识。 不足： 在实训过程中，我发现自己的语音转换速度还不够快，有些音还需要更多的练习才能发音准确无误。此外，我在节奏感上也有一些欠缺，需要进一步提高。另外，由于时间有限，我还没有完全掌握一些较为复杂的音标和发音规则，仍需加强学习。 后续学习计划： 为了进一步提高自己的英语语音水平，我计划进行以下学习： 1. 继续每天进行朗读练习，尽量模仿标准的英文发音，并对比自己的发音进行纠正。 2. 利用在线学习资源，找到一些专门针对发音的教学视频或者课程，并进行学习和练习。 3. 多参加英语口语交流活动，锻炼自己的口语表达能力，在实践中不断修正和完善自己的发音。 4. 针对自己的发音问题，进行有针对性的练习和训练，加强对特定音标和发音规则的理解和掌握。 5. 定期参加语音训练班或者请教专业的语音教师，接受更系统的指导和训练。 通过以上的学习计划，我相信我能够进一步提高自己的英语语音水平，更加流利地进行英语口语表达。"},{"instruction":"Каждый экземпляр поставки имеет уникальный серийный номер, и в него помимо дистрибутива платформы входит приложение, реализующее функциональностъ 3ПК с помощью формуляра с контрольными суммами.","output":"Этот серийный номер является идентификатором конкретного экземпляра поставки и используется для его учета и отслеживания.

Однако, приведу пример базового кода для создания оконного интерфейса в Unity 3D: ```csharp using UnityEngine; public class WindowManager : MonoBehaviour { public void OpenWindow(GameObject window) { window.SetActive(true); } public void CloseWindow(GameObject window) { window.SetActive(false); } } ``` В данном примере предполагается, что у вас уже есть несколько игровых объектов с окнами в сцене Unity. Код выше содержит два метода: `OpenWindow` и `CloseWindow`, которые открывают и закрывают окна путем установки активности соответствующего игрового объекта. Для использования этого кода, вам необходимо создать скрипт компоненты и прикрепить его к одному из игровых объектов в вашей сцене. Затем, вы можете вызывать методы `OpenWindow` и `CloseWindow`, передавая им ссылку на игровой объект окна, который нужно открыть или закрыть. например: ```csharp public class SomeUIController : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject window1; public GameObject window2; private WindowManager windowManager; private void Awake() { windowManager = GetComponent<WindowManager>(); } public void OpenWindow1() { windowManager.OpenWindow(window1); } public void CloseWindow2() { windowManager.CloseWindow(window2); } } ``` В данном примере предполагается, что у вас есть две кнопки на экране, которые отвечают за открытие и закрытие двух разных окон. `window1` и `window2` - это ссылки на игровые объекты с окнами, которые нужно открыть или закрыть. Компонента `WindowManager` прикрепляется к тому же игровому объекту, на котором находится `SomeUIController`. В коде выше для вызова метода `OpenWindow` и `CloseWindow` используется ссылка на `windowManager`, который предварительно получен с помощью `GetComponent<WindowManager>()`."},{"instruction":"пусть окна лежат в ресурсах, нужно загружать их на время показа и выгружать после для экономии ресурсов","output":"Чтобы загружать окна из ресурсов и выгружать их для экономии ресурсов, вам придется использовать методы `Resources.Load` и `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets` в Unity. Вот пример, как можно адаптировать предыдущий код для этой цели: ```csharp using UnityEngine; public class WindowManager : MonoBehaviour { private GameObject activeWindow; public void OpenWindow(string windowPath) { if (activeWindow != null) { CloseWindow(); } GameObject windowPrefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>(windowPath); if (windowPrefab != null) { activeWindow = Instantiate(windowPrefab); } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Failed to load window prefab at path: \\" + windowPath); } } public void CloseWindow() { if (activeWindow != null) { Destroy(activeWindow); activeWindow = null; Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets(); } } } ``` В этом примере, ресурсное окно загружается через `Resources.Load<GameObject>(windowPath)`, где `windowPath` - это путь к файлу ресурса в проекте Unity (например, \\"Prefabs/WindowPrefab\\"). Если окно успешно загружено, оно создается с помощью `Instantiate(windowPrefab)`. Если окно уже открыто, оно сначала закрывается путем вызова метода `CloseWindow`. При закрытии окна, метод `CloseWindow` освобождает ресурсы с помощью вызова `Destroy(activeWindow)` и `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()`. Когда вы хотите открыть окно, просто вызовите метод `OpenWindow` и передайте путь к ресурсу окна. Например: ```csharp public class SomeUIController : MonoBehaviour { private WindowManager windowManager; private void Awake() { windowManager = GetComponent<WindowManager>(); } public void OpenWindow1() { windowManager.OpenWindow(\\"Prefabs/Window1Prefab\\"); } public void CloseWindow() { windowManager.CloseWindow(); } } ``` В этом примере, при вызове `OpenWindow1()`, окно \\"Window1Prefab\\" будет загружено из ресурсов и создано. При вызове `CloseWindow()`, окно будет закрыто и ресурсы будут освобождены."},{"instruction":"как добавить ресурс в сериализуемое поле в инспеторе юнити, чтобы этот ресурс не был загружен в память немедленно?","output":"Чтобы добавить ресурс в сериализуемое поле в инспекторе Unity и не загружать его в память немедленно, вы можете использовать AssetReference или ObjectField в сочетании с задержкой загрузки в редакторе. Это позволит вам загружать ресурс только по требованию, когда вы действительно его нуждаетесь. Вот пример: ```csharp using UnityEngine; public class WindowController : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private AssetReference windowPrefabReference; // или // [SerializeField] // private Object windowPrefabObjectField; private GameObject activeWindow; public void OpenWindow() { // Загрузить ресурс только по требованию if (windowPrefabReference.Asset != null) { activeWindow = Instantiate(windowPrefabReference.Asset); } // или // activeWindow = Instantiate(windowPrefabObjectField as GameObject); } public void CloseWindow() { if (activeWindow != null) { Destroy(activeWindow); activeWindow = null; } } } ``` В этом примере `windowPrefabReference` - это сериализуемое поле класса `AssetReference`, которое предоставляет ссылку на ресурс в редакторе Unity. Это поле будет отображаться в инспекторе Unity, где вы сможете выбрать и назначить ресурс. Используя `AssetReference`, загрузка ресурса откладывается до тех пор, пока не будет вызвано его фактическое использование (например, при вызове `OpenWindow()`). Обратите внимание, что поле `windowPrefabReference.Asset` имеет значение `null` по умолчанию, если ресурс еще не был загружен. Если вы предпочитаете использовать `ObjectField`, то можете закомментировать использование `AssetReference` и соответствующий код, а затем раскомментировать строки, связанные с `ObjectField`."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

// 调用接口进行查询 fetch(apiUrl) .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { res.json(data); }) .catch(error => { console.error(\\"查询失败:\\", error); res.status(500).send(\\"查询失败\\"); }); }); app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`后端服务正在运行，监听端口 {port}`); }); ``` 在后端代码中，我们创建了一个Express应用并监听3000端口。我们定义了一个路由`/search`，当收到GET请求时，从查询参数中获取ID，并构建查询接口的URL。然后使用`fetch()`函数调用该接口，并将返回的数据作为JSON格式发送回前端。 请注意，上述后端代码中使用了`node-fetch`库来进行HTTP请求，你需要在后端项目中安装并引入这个库。 这只是一个简单的示例，你需要根据实际情况修改代码以适应你的项目需求。同时，还需要处理错误情况，例如查询失败时的错误处理等。"},{"instruction":"id, _ := strconv.ParseUint(req.HTTPRequest().PostFormValue(\\"id\\"), 10, 64)","output":"根据你提供的代码片段，看起来你正在使用Go语言来解析HTTP请求中的ID参数。这段代码使用了`strconv.ParseUint()`函数来将字符串类型的ID转换为无符号整数。请注意，`strconv.ParseUint()`函数的第一个参数是待转换的字符串，第二个参数是数字的基数（通常是10），第三个参数是返回的整数类型的位数。 以下是一个完整示例，展示了如何根据你提供的代码来正确解析HTTP请求中的ID参数： ```go import ( \\"strconv\\" \\"net/http\\" ) func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { idStr := r.PostFormValue(\\"id\\") id, err := strconv.ParseUint(idStr, 10, 64) if err != nil { http.Error(w, \\"无效的ID\\", http.StatusBadRequest) return } // 使用解析后的ID进行查询或其他操作 // ... // 返回响应 w.Write([]byte(\\"查询成功\\")) } func main() { http.HandleFunc(\\"/\\", handler) http.ListenAndServe(\\":8080\\", nil) } ``` 在上述例子中，我们定义了一个HTTP请求处理函数`handler`，它从POST请求的表单数据中获取ID参数并进行解析。如果解析失败，我们使用`http.Error()`函数向客户端返回一个400（错误的请求）的HTTP响应。否则，我们可以使用解析后的ID进行进一步的查询或其他操作。 然后，在`main`函数中，我们使用`http.HandleFunc()`函数来注册路由和处理函数，然后使用`http.ListenAndServe()`函数启动HTTP服务器。 请根据你的项目需求适当修改上述示例代码，例如更改路由和处理函数的路径、添加其他的表单参数解析等。"},{"instruction":"id, _ := req.HTTPRequest().PostFormValue(\\"id\\"),","output":"根据你提供的代码片段，你正在使用Go语言来获取HTTP请求中的ID参数的值。这段代码使用了`req.HTTPRequest().PostFormValue()`方法来获取表单中名为\\"id\\"的参数的值。 从 `req.HTTPRequest()` 获取到原始的 HTTP 请求，然后使用 `PostFormValue()` 方法来获取 ID 参数的值，返回的是一个字符串。 下面是一个示例代码，展示了如何根据你提供的代码来获取 HTTP 请求中的 ID 参数的值： ```go import ( \\"fmt\\" \\"net/http\\" ) func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { id := r.PostFormValue(\\"id\\") fmt.Println(\\"ID:\\", id) // 进行查询或其他操作 // ... // 返回响应 w.Write([]byte(\\"查询成功\\")) } func main() { http.HandleFunc(\\"/\\", handler) http.ListenAndServe(\\":8080\\", nil) } ``` 在上述示例中，我们定义了一个 HTTP 请求处理函数 `handler`，它使用 `r.PostFormValue(\\"id\\")` 来获取请求中名为 \\"id\\" 的参数的值，并将其存储在 `id` 变量中。然后，我们可以使用该值进行进一步的查询或其他操作。 接下来，在 `main` 函数中，我们使用 `http.HandleFunc()` 函数注册路由和处理函数，然后使用 `http.ListenAndServe()` 启动 HTTP 服务器。 请根据你的项目需求适当修改上述示例代码，例如更改路由和处理函数的路径、处理错误情况等。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Their first task is to investigate the recent rise of dark magic plaguing the city. Following a lead, they travel to the ruins of an ancient library said to hold the answers they seek. Inside the library, they face puzzles, traps, and encounters with eerie creatures. Goku, in his towering barbarian form, effortlessly smashes through obstacles, while Vegeta expertly disarms traps with his rogue mastery. Piccolo\'s divine powers come to the fore as he dispels ancient curses and heals his allies. Meanwhile, Bulma\'s technological inventions prove invaluable, providing illumination, map analysis, and even defensive gadgets. Gohan taps into his latent wizard abilities, casting spells to overcome magical barriers and identify ancient texts. Krillin, with his swift strikes and agile movements, swiftly dispatches enemies that stand in their way. After navigating through treacherous corridors, the party discovers a secret chamber housing a powerful artifact that has been corrupted by dark magic. It exudes an aura of malevolence, causing the air to grow thick with tension. Suddenly, the artifact unleashes a horde of shadow creatures, surrounding the party. A fierce battle ensues as Goku unleashes his boundless strength, obliterating shadows left and right. Vegeta\'s razor-sharp daggers dance with blinding speed, slicing through enemies. Piccolo channels divine energy, banishing shadows with radiant light. The combined efforts of Bulma\'s gadgets and Gohan\'s powerful spells obliterate countless foes. Krillin, sensing an opportunity, strikes with precision, taking down the remaining enemies. With the shadows defeated, the corrupted artifact suddenly crumbles, releasing a burst of pure energy, dispelling the dark magic that plagued the library. The party has successfully restored balance to Arcania and uncovered a clue about the mastermind behind the city\'s troubles. CONCLUSION: As the victorious Dragon Ball heroes catch their breath, they share a sense of accomplishment and excitement for future adventures. Their camaraderie grows stronger, and they eagerly await the next chapter of their D&D expedition. Stay tuned for Part 3 to witness the unfolding of their epic journey as they face even greater challenges, forge new alliances, and uncover the truth behind the sinister presence that looms over Arcania!"},{"instruction":"（一）主题：以“新时代连州该怎么办怎么干”为主题，以普通个体的亲历体验，从不同角度，真实反映和生动刻画新时代连州紧扣推进制造业当家、实施“百县千镇万村高质量发展工程”、绿美连州生态建设、城乡协调融合发展、保障和改善民生、平安法治建设、乡村振兴、党员志愿者服务、招商引资等生动局面，体现出对如何促进连州高质量发展的深度思考，并提出新思路、新举措。作品内容健康向上，充分展示我市党员干部职工在新时代该怎么办怎么干，展望连州高质量发展的美好前景，以及人民群众昂扬向上的精神风貌。以议论文为体裁，写一篇不少2500字的文章。","output":"新时代连州该怎么办怎么干 近年来，我市连州在党的坚强领导下，紧扣推进制造业当家、实施“百县千镇万村高质量发展工程”、绿美连州生态建设、城乡协调融合发展、保障和改善民生、平安法治建设、乡村振兴、党员志愿者服务、招商引资等方面取得了显著成绩。面对新时代的变革和发展，连州如何继续推动高质量发展？本文将从普通个体的亲历体验出发，以不同角度真实反映和生动刻画连州的发展现状，以及提出新的思路和举措。 一、推进制造业当家 作为一个以制造业为主要支柱的地区，连州积极响应党和国家的号召，大力推进制造业当家。从笔者所在的制造企业可以看出，近年来，连州在制造业方面取得了巨大成就。企业通过科技创新，提高产品质量和市场竞争力。同时，连州政府还加大对制造业的扶持力度，提供优惠政策和基础设施建设，吸引更多企业入驻连州。未来，连州应继续深化制造业转型升级，培育高端制造业，提升自主创新能力，以推动连州制造业向更高层次发展。 二、实施“百县千镇万村高质量发展工程” “百县千镇万村高质量发展工程”是连州眼下的重要任务之一。我们所在的乡村正是这一工程的受益者之一。通过加强基础设施建设、提高农村产业水平、推动农村治理创新等措施，连州乡村焕发了新的活力。例如，连州政府鼓励农民发展特色产业，我们村的农民种植了特色品种的水果，不仅提高了收入，还推动了村庄的发展。未来，连州应继续加大对农村发展的支持力度，提高农民收入，实现城乡共同繁荣。 三、绿美连州生态建设 连州位于自然生态资源丰富的山区，生态建设是十分重要的任务。我们所在的企业每年都会组织员工参与环保意识培训，并积极参与植树活动。连州政府也加大力度开展生态环境保护工作，采取一系列措施保护山水林田湖，推动绿色出行、低碳生活，使连州成为一个宜居宜业的地方。未来，连州还应进一步加强生态文明建设，规范水资源利用和环境保护，打造生态宜居示范区。 四、城乡协调融合发展 连州城乡发展不平衡的问题依然存在，城市和农村之间差距较大。笔者所在的乡村一直希望能够借助连州市政府的力量，改善乡村的基础设施和公共服务。连州市政府已经采取了一些措施，但还需要进一步加大力度，通过充分发挥城市的辐射带动作用，推动城乡协调融合发展，实现全域共建共享。 五、保障和改善民生 保障和改善民生是连州政府的重要责任。近年来，连州市政府在医疗、教育、养老等领域采取了一系列措施，提高了人民群众的生活质量。我们所在的企业也积极参与公益事业，为贫困地区捐款捐物。未来，连州应进一步加大对民生事业的投入，提高全民的幸福指数。 六、平安法治建设 连州的平安法治建设是社会稳定和持续发展的关键所在。连州已经加大了对治安管理和社会秩序的维护力度，净化了社会环境，提高了人民群众的安全感。未来，连州应进一步推进平安法治建设，完善法治体系，加大法律宣传力度，营造法治化的社会环境。 七、乡村振兴 乡村振兴是我市当前的重要任务之一。连州农村的发展亟待改善。我们所在的乡村正是目前乡村振兴的受益者之一。连州政府实施的一系列扶贫政策让农民感受到了政府的关爱。未来，连州应进一步加大对乡村振兴的支持，鼓励农民发展特色产业，提高农民收入水平，推动农村经济发展。 八、党员志愿者服务 连州的党员干部发挥了积极的作用，他们积极参与各项志愿者服务活动，为社会做出了贡献。在我们所在的乡村，党员干部每年都会组织一次义务植树活动，宣传环保理念，呼吁大家保护生态环境。未来，连州的党员干部应进一步提高自身素质，发挥好先锋模范作用，为连州的发展贡献力量。 九、招商引资 连州招商引资是推动经济发展的关键所在。近年来，连州市政府加大了对招商引资的力度，为企业提供了良好的发展环境。作为一家私营企业的负责人，我亲身感受到了连州政府为企业提供的支持和帮助。未来，连州应进一步完善招商引资的政策，加大对企业的扶持力度，吸引更多大型企业和项目入驻连州。 综上所述，新时代的连州正朝着高质量发展的方向迈进。党员干部、企事业单位以及全体人民群众都应该怎么办怎么干，共同为连州的美好未来而努力奋斗。我们有信心，通过党的坚强领导和全体人民的共同努力，连州一定能够实现高质量发展，迎来更美好的明天！"},{"instruction":"合同里面有好几个附件，但是有一个附件是excel很多个sheet和表格不好放，怎么在合同里说明不是合同里面的附件，是另加其他附件，用合同专业描述语言约定一下，谢谢","output":"合同附件声明 本合同附带相关文件，包括但不限于附件A、附件B等各项附件。特别声明，本合同附带的附件中包含一个名为【附件名】的文件，该文件为Excel格式，包含多个表格和工作表。由于该文件的特殊性质，无法直接纳入本合同的正文中。因此，作为一项附加附件，【附件名】作为另外的附件单独列明，并置于本合同所有其他附件之后。 特此声明。 【你的名称/签名】 【日期】"},{"instruction":"Thu nhập và sức mua của khách hàng thuộc môi trường văn hóa - xã hội","output":"Thu nhập và sức mua của khách hàng thuộc môi trường văn hóa - xã hội có thể được ảnh hưởng bởi nhiều yếu tố như: 1.

[player]: “I can’t just leave you here all alone. We’ll figure something out.” (The player carefully picks up the newborn Ghast, cradling it in their arms. It feels remarkably light, fragile even, but its small, glowing eyes peer up at the player with a mix of exhaustion and gratitude.) [player]: “I’ll take you back to my base, little one. It might be a bit different from the Nether, but it’s safer there.” (With the newborn Ghast in tow, the player makes their way back through the Nether, navigating the twisted landscape and avoiding other hostile creatures. Surprisingly, none of them pose a threat. It’s as if they sense the player is protecting one of their own.) [Player’s Base…] (The player carefully places the newborn Ghast in a cozy corner of their base, ensuring it has a warm, comfortable spot. They quickly construct a fenced area, creating a small, safe space for the newborn Ghast to call its own.) [player]: “There you go, little one. This will be your home now.” (The newborn Ghast lets out a contented gurgle, exploring its new surroundings. The player watches with a smile, relieved to have saved this vulnerable creature from a potentially grim fate.) [player]: “I’ll take care of you, don’t worry. We’ll be friends, and maybe one day you’ll grow up to be a majestic, gentle creature. I think I’ll name you…Charloette.” (As the player tends to their newfound companion, providing it with food and attention, a bond begins to form. Together, they navigate the challenges of the Overworld, forging an unlikely friendship that transcends the stark differences between them.) (The world may be filled with red in the Nether, but within the player’s base, a small sliver of compassion and companionship exists, reminding them that even in the darkest places, kindness can thrive.) (Five days later, the player notices that Charloette is already a child.)","output":"[player]: \\"Wow, Charloette, you\'re growing up so fast! Look at how much you\'ve grown in just a few days.\\" (Charloette playfully bounces around the fenced area, its tentacles flailing in excitement. The player watches with a sense of pride and happiness.) [player]: \\"You\'ve become such a bright and lively companion. I\'m glad I found you that day in the Nether. We make a great team, don\'t we?\\" (Charloette emits a high-pitched squeal, seemingly agreeing with the player\'s statement. It circles around the player, teasingly brushing against them with its tail.) [player]: \\"Haha, you playful little one. I never thought I\'d find such joy and companionship in the Nether, of all places.\\" (The player spends their days exploring the Overworld with Charloette by their side. Together, they face mobs, gather resources, and discover new places. Charloette\'s presence brings a sense of comfort and protection to the player, as if they\'re never truly alone.) [player]: \\"You know, Charloette, you\'re not like other Ghasts. You\'re gentle, kind-hearted, and filled with curiosity. I\'m grateful for the bond we share.\\" (Charloette emits a soft purring sound, snuggling against the player\'s leg. The player strokes its head gently, feeling a deep connection and understanding between them.) [player]: \\"I wonder… do other creatures in the Nether have the capacity for kindness and compassion? Maybe, just maybe, there\'s more to this barren realm than meets the eye.\\" (Charloette nods its head, as if encouraging the player to continue their investigations. Together, they embark on a new quest to understand the Nether, to uncover its secrets, and to bring a glimmer of hope to this desolate place.) (The player and Charloette\'s adventures in the Nether continue, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. As they delve deeper into the unknown, they begin to realize that even in the most seemingly inhospitable environments, love, compassion, and friendship can thrive.) (And in their own small corner of the player\'s base, where Charloette now calls home, a beacon of warmth shines, reminding them both that they are never alone.)"},{"instruction":"（一）主题：以“新时代连州该怎么办怎么干”为主题，以普通个体的亲历体验，从不同角度，真实反映和生动刻画新时代连州绿美连州生态建设、城乡协调融合发展、保障和改善民生、平安法治建设、乡村振兴、招商引资等生动局面，体现出对如何促进连州高质量发展的深度思考，并提出新思路、新举措。作品内容健康向上，充分展示我市党员干部职工在新时代该怎么办怎么干，展望连州高质量发展的美好前景，以及人民群众昂扬向上的精神风貌。字数不少于2500字。","output":"新时代连州该怎么办怎么干 新时代，连州正面临着众多挑战和机遇。作为一个普通个体，我有幸亲身经历了连州在绿美生态建设、城乡协调融合发展、保障和改善民生、平安法治建设、乡村振兴、招商引资等方面的变化与发展。在这篇文章中，我将从多个角度真实反映和生动刻画这些局面，并深度思考如何促进连州高质量发展，并提出新的思路和举措。 连州，这片土地曾经是遍地矿产资源的天堂，但在过去的几十年中，连州人民为了保护环境、提升生态质量付出了巨大的努力。如今，当我走在连州的山间小径上，呼吸着清新的空气，听着鸟语花香，心中不禁对这片绿色的土地跃跃欲试。然而，要使连州的生态绿化工作更上层楼，我们仍需要继续努力。我认为，应该加强生态保护和恢复工作，推动生态环境的可持续发展。比如，可以积极引进高新技术，推广节能环保产业，加强环保宣传教育，让每个人都认识到保护环境是我们每个人的责任。 城乡协调融合发展是新时代连州面临的又一个重要问题。过去，城乡发展的不平衡导致了许多问题，如农村人口外流、农业面临困境等。然而，随着连州经济的快速发展，农村地区的发展潜力逐渐被发掘出来。我认为，要实现城乡协调融合发展，首先要加强城乡基础设施建设，如交通、通讯等。其次，要改善农村的产业结构，培育农村新兴产业，提高农民收入水平。最后，要加强城乡交流与合作，促进城乡资源共享和互通有无。 保障和改善民生是党的初心和使命，也是连州高质量发展的重要目标之一。在过去的几年中，连州在教育、医疗、社保等方面取得了显著的进展。然而，仍有一些人面临着住房困难、医疗保障不足等问题。为了解决这些问题，我认为可以加大对社会保障体系的建设和改革力度，提高低保、医保、教育补助等民生保障的覆盖范围和水平。同时，还可以鼓励社会力量参与民生事业，推动社区养老、养育等服务的发展，提高人民群众的获得感和幸福感。 平安法治建设是社会稳定和长治久安的重要保障。在新时代，连州面临的安全挑战日益复杂多变，如打击犯罪、维护社会秩序等。我认为，要加强公安机关的力量和管理，提高警务能力和技术水平，加强社会治安、交通管理等方面的工作。同时，还要加强法治宣传和教育工作，提高人民群众法律意识，增强法治信仰和自律。 乡村振兴是新时代连州发展的重要战略。在过去的几年中，连州乡村面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。我曾经看到过连州山村的贫困户通过种养殖、旅游开发等方式脱贫致富的经历，心中感慨万分。然而，为了进一步推进乡村振兴，我们仍然需要更多的政策支持和资源投入。比如，可以加大对农村基础设施建设的投资，加强对农民工的就业培训和创业扶持，培育农村产业发展新动能。 招商引资是连州高质量发展的关键所在。在新时代，连州积极引进各类优质项目，加快推进工业转型升级等工作。我认为，要进一步提升连州的产业竞争力，就需要积极创造良好的投资环境。比如，可以建立健全法规和政策体系，加大对各类企业和项目的支持力度，提供更好的服务和保障，吸引更多的投资者和合作伙伴。 总之，新时代连州该怎么办怎么干，需要我们共同思考和努力。作为普通个体，我将紧紧围绕绿美生态建设、城乡协调融合发展、保障和改善民生、平安法治建设、乡村振兴、招商引资等方面，发挥自己的作用，为连州高质量发展贡献自己的力量。我相信，在党的领导和人民群众的共同努力下，连州的明天会更加美好！"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some key features to look for in a bottle-shaped reservoir hummingbird feeder: 1. Material: Look for a feeder made from high-quality glass or durable plastic. Glass feeders are more visually appealing and can withstand outdoor elements better than plastic, but plastic feeders are often more affordable and lighter. 2. Feeding Ports: Ensure that the feeder has multiple feeding ports. Hummingbirds are territorial, and having multiple ports allows more birds to feed simultaneously without aggressive behavior. 3. Perches: Look for perches near each feeding port. Some hummingbirds prefer to sit while feeding rather than hover. Perches provide a comfortable resting spot and attract a wider variety of hummingbird species. 4. Easy to Fill: Choose a feeder with a wide mouth or detachable reservoir for easy filling. This makes it convenient to refill without spilling or wasting nectar. 5. Easy to Clean: A feeder that is easy to disassemble and clean is crucial for maintaining good hygiene. Look for feeders that can be fully disassembled to prevent mold and bacteria from growing. 6. Good Nectar Capacity: Opt for a feeder with a decent nectar capacity to minimize frequent refilling. A larger capacity reduces the frequency of refilling and provides more nectar for visiting hummingbirds. 7. Frequent Refilling: Keep in mind that due to their high metabolic rate, hummingbirds consume a lot of nectar.

Per spiegare questa operazione, è necessario comprendere alcune terminologie finanziarie di base: - Derivati: un tipo di strumento finanziario il cui valore deriva da un altro asset sottostante, come ad esempio un\'azione, un indice o una merce. - Put: un tipo di opzione che conferisce al titolare il diritto, ma non l\'obbligo, di vendere l\'asset sottostante ad un prezzo concordato (detto prezzo di esercizio o strike price) entro una data di scadenza specificata. - Indici: rappresentano un paniere di azioni che rappresentano il rendimento medio di un gruppo di aziende. Quindi, quando viene detto che Warren Buffett ha venduto put sugli indici, significa che ha venduto opzioni put per guadagnare premi. In pratica, Buffett ha offerto ad altri investitori la possibilità di vendere l\'indice ad un prezzo stabilito in cambio di un pagamento (premio). Se l\'indice non raggiunge il prezzo di esercizio alla data di scadenza dell\'opzione, Buffett può trattenere il premio come profitto. Tuttavia, se l\'indice scende al di sotto del prezzo di esercizio, l\'investitore che ha comprato l\'opzione put potrebbe esercitare il diritto di vendita, e Buffett dovrebbe acquistare l\'indice ad un prezzo superiore al valore di mercato attuale. In sostanza, questa strategia consente a Buffett di ottenere premi dalle opzioni put vendute, ma vi è il rischio di dover acquistare l\'asset sottostante ad un prezzo superiore al suo valore di mercato nel caso in cui l\'indice scenda significativamente. Tuttavia, come molti dettagli della strategia non sono stati forniti nella frase, va ricordato che l\'operazione di investimento di Buffett potrebbe essere stata più complessa di quanto descritto qui."},{"instruction":"做退货单的目的","output":"做退货单的目的是记录顾客退还商品的信息和原因，并进行相应的退款或换货处理。这可以帮助商家管理退货流程，提供良好的客户服务，保持客户满意度，同时确保企业的财务记录准确和完整。退货单还可以用于统计退货原因，帮助企业了解产品质量问题或改进销售策略，提升产品质量和客户体验。"},{"instruction":"标线上小红书，天猫、淘宝、拼多多的价格","output":"很抱歉，作为一个语言模型，我无法为您提供最新的价格信息。由于在线平台上的商品价格经常变动，且可能因地区、促销等因素而有所不同，因此获取当前价格的最佳方式是直接访问相关网站或使用相应的移动应用程序进行查询。"},{"instruction":"促销折让力度，及毛利控制，属于新品的什么","output":"促销折让力度和毛利控制是与新品营销相关的一些策略和控制手段。它们属于新品营销中的市场推广和财务方面的考虑。 促销折让力度是指通过降价、优惠、赠品等促销手段来吸引消费者购买新产品的程度。这可以帮助企业提高新产品的曝光度和销量，促进市场渗透和用户体验。 毛利控制是指企业在销售新产品时控制成本和定价，以确保产品销售后的毛利率达到预期水平。这对于企业来说至关重要，因为销售新产品可能需要面临研发成本、市场推广费用等投入，同时还要保持足够的利润以支持企业的运营和发展。 综上所述，促销折让力度和毛利控制是新品营销中与市场推广和财务控制相关的策略和手段。"},{"instruction":"Bachelors of Arts in business communication in canada","output":"There are several universities and colleges in Canada that offer a Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication.

System.out.println(operand1 + \\" \\" + operation + \\" \\" + operand2 + \\" = \\" + result); } } } ``` 在这个例子中，我们使用枚举类`Operation`表示不同的运算符，并定义了一个抽象方法`calculate`，用于计算两个操作数的结果。然后，在`Calculator`类的`main`方法中，我们遍历枚举类`Operation`的所有值，并调用`calculate`方法计算结果，并打印输出。这样，我们就可以使用枚举类中的抽象方法实现一个简单的计算器程序。"},{"instruction":"AND INSTR(user.name, #{createUserName}) 什么意思","output":"这个表达式是一个SQL语句的一部分，用于在数据库中进行模糊匹配查询。 - `INSTR`是一个SQL函数，用于查找一个字符串中是否包含另一个子字符串。它返回子字符串在主字符串中的位置，如果找不到则返回0。 - `user.name`是数据库表中的一个列，表示用户的姓名。 - `#{createUserName}`是一个占位符，表示需要在实际查询时用真实的用户姓名替换。 因此，这个表达式的意思是在`user.name`列中查找是否包含指定的用户姓名（通过占位符`#{createUserName}`传递）。如果包含，`INSTR`函数会返回大于0的值，表示找到了匹配；如果不包含，返回0，表示未找到匹配。 注意：这段代码可能是使用MyBatis这类持久层框架进行数据库查询时，根据用户输入的姓名进行模糊匹配。具体的用法还需要根据上下文来确定。"},{"instruction":"Optional.ifPresent()用法","output":"`Optional.ifPresent()`是Java中`Optional`类的一个方法，用于执行一个操作，如果`Optional`对象中包含非空的值。 `Optional`是Java 8中引入的一个类，用于处理可能为空的值。它提供了一些方法，可以更方便地处理可能为空的值，避免了NullPointerException的风险。 `ifPresent(Consumer<? super T> action)`方法接受一个`Consumer`函数式接口作为参数，当`Optional`对象中有值时，会执行该`Consumer`函数接口的`accept()`方法。 以下是`ifPresent()`方法的使用示例： ```java Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.of(\\"Hello Optional\\"); optionalValue.ifPresent(value -> { System.out.println(value); // 输出: Hello Optional // 在这里可以执行其他操作，如对值进行处理或传递给其他方法等 }); ``` 在这个示例中，我们创建了一个包装非空字符串的`Optional`对象`optionalValue`。然后，我们使用`ifPresent()`方法传入一个lambda表达式作为参数。当`optionalValue`有值时，即非空字符串时，该lambda表达式会被执行，输出字符串的内容。 通过使用`ifPresent()`方法，我们可以在`Optional`对象中包含有值时执行特定的操作，避免了显式地进行`null`检查。这样可以使代码更简洁、安全，并且更好地表达代码意图。"},{"instruction":"@PostConstruct 作用","output":"`@PostConstruct`是Java中的一个注解（标记），用于指定一个方法在对象初始化后立即执行。 它的作用是在对象被创建后，执行一些初始化操作，例如初始化变量、建立数据库连接等等。通常情况下，`@PostConstruct`注解会与`javax.annotation`或`javax.annotation.PostConstruct`包一起使用。 以下是`@PostConstruct`的使用示例： ```java import javax.annotation.PostConstruct; public class ExampleClass { @PostConstruct public void init() { // 在这里执行初始化操作 System.out.println(\\"Initializing object...\\"); } // 其他方法和字段等 public static void main(String[] args) { ExampleClass example = new ExampleClass(); // 执行初始化方法 example.init(); } } ``` 在这个示例中，我们为`ExampleClass`类的一个方法添加了`@PostConstruct`注解，并命名为`init()`。当`ExampleClass`对象被创建后，`init()`方法会被自动调用，并执行初始化操作。 值得注意的是，`@PostConstruct`注解只能用于非静态方法。如果一个类有多个使用了`@PostConstruct`注解的方法，那么它们的执行顺序是不确定的。 使用`@PostConstruct`可以在对象初始化后执行一些必要的操作，避免了在构造函数中进行一些复杂的初始化逻辑，使代码更清晰、可维护。"},{"instruction":"@Resource 注入为null","output":"当使用`@Resource`注解进行依赖注入时，如果注入的对象为`null`，可能是由以下几个原因导致的： 1. 未正确配置依赖资源：确保在注入对象的地方正确配置了需要注入的资源。例如，在类中的成员变量上使用`@Resource`注解，确保注入的对象已经通过容器或其他方式正确创建和配置。 2. 注入对象的名称或属性名不匹配：检查注入对象的名称或属性名是否与被注入对象的名称或属性名匹配。`@Resource`注解如果没有指定name属性，默认会根据字段名或方法名进行查找匹配。 3. 未正确配置依赖注入的容器: 如果使用了依赖注入的容器（如Spring）来管理对象和依赖关系，确保容器已正确配置和初始化。如果容器配置有误，可能会导致注入的对象为`null`。 4. 异步或并发问题：如果注入的对象在并发或异步环境中使用，可能出现注入对象为`null`的情况。在这种情况下，需要考虑线程安全性和同步机制，以确保对象正确被注入。 检查并解决这些可能的原因，可以帮助解决`@Resource`注解注入为`null`的问题。如果问题仍然存在，建议提供更多的代码和上下文信息，以便更准确地诊断和解决问题。"},{"instruction":"how to use parameter field in measure in DAX power BI?","output":"In Power BI, you can use the Parameter field in a measure by performing the following steps: 1. Create a parameter table: First, create a parameter table that contains the values you want to use as parameters. The parameter table should have a column for the parameter values and another column to use as a slicer or filter. 2. Import the parameter table: Import the parameter table into your Power BI model by going to the \\"Home\\" tab > \\"Get Data\\" > \\"More\\" and selecting the appropriate data source. 3. Create a relationship: Create a relationship between the parameter table and the table you want to apply the parameter to. This will allow you to filter the table using the parameter values. 4. Create a measure: In the \\"Modeling\\" tab, click on \\"New Measure\\" to create a new measure. Use the DAX formula to define the calculation for the measure, including the parameter field. For example, if you want to calculate the total sales for a specific parameter value (e.g., year), the measure formula could be something like: Total Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ParameterTable[Year] = SELECTEDVALUE(ParameterTable[Year])) Here, \\"ParameterTable[Year]\\" refers to the column in the parameter table containing the parameter values, and \\"SELECTEDVALUE(ParameterTable[Year])\\" retrieves the selected parameter value from the slicer or filter. 5. Use the measure with the parameter: Add the measure to a visual, such as a table or a chart, and use the parameter field as a slicer or filter to dynamically change the measure result based on the selected parameter value. That\'s it! You can now use the parameter field in a measure to perform calculations or apply filters based on parameter values in Power BI."},{"instruction":"what is the height of layered figure from 4.07*10^35 cubes of 0.25*0.25*0.25 mm size and the base of figure 10000 km by 10000 km?","output":"To find the height of the layered figure, we need to calculate the total volume of all the cubes and then divide it by the area of the base.

This mod allows him to transform into a Super Saiyan, increasing his combat abilities and speed. It\'s not long before entire raider factions fall in awe of his power. 2. Instant Transmission Mod: Goku adds his signature teleportation ability to the game. With the Instant Transmission mod, he can instantly teleport himself and his allies anywhere on the map.

Here are some of the mods Goku decided to install in part 1 of his RimWorld adventure: 1. Goku\'s Gi Mod: Goku found a mod that allowed him to dress his colonists in his iconic orange gi. Now, he could transform his ordinary settlers into mini Gokus, ready to take on any challenges that came their way. 2. Training Room Mod: Being a master martial artist, Goku craved a place to train and hone his skills. So, he added a training room mod to his colony. This room provided a dedicated space for his colonists to train their combat abilities, just like Goku did back on Earth. 3. Capsule Corp Technology Mod: Goku stumbled upon a mod that enabled him to unlock advanced technological advancements from the famous Capsule Corp. With this mod, his colony gained access to futuristic gadgets, such as jetpacks, hoverboards, and energy-based weapons. 4.

Once gathered, Goku could summon Shenron, the divine dragon, and make a wish to assist his colony, such as improving their defenses or bringing back fallen colonists. With these mods in place, Goku\'s RimWorld journey became an exciting fusion of Dragon Ball Z and colony management. His colonists thrived under his guidance, armed with powerful abilities and advanced technology.

Once the game loaded, Goku was greeted with a vast and untamed planet. He was in control of a group of survivors who had crash-landed on this unknown world. Their main objective was to build a colony and survive the harsh conditions. Goku immediately got to work, assigning tasks to his survivors. He had to construct shelters, gather resources, and ensure their basic needs were met. However, Goku\'s energy and enthusiasm caused him to overlook a few basic details. As night fell, Goku realized that he had forgotten to set up any sort of defense against the native wildlife on the planet. Just as he thought this, a group of angry squirrels attacked his helpless survivors. Not expecting such a challenge, Goku quickly scrambled to set up a makeshift barrier to protect his colony. As time went on, Goku began to grasp the intricacies of RimWorld. He learned how to grow crops and raise animals, as well as how to research advanced technologies to improve the quality of life for his survivors. However, Goku\'s impulsive nature led to some interesting and unpredictable outcomes. One day, Goku decided to hunt down a nearby pack of deer to provide food for his colony. However, he didn\'t anticipate that the deer would defend themselves. In the middle of the hunt, Goku found himself engaged in a wild melee brawl with the deer, which left him with a few scratches and bruises. Despite the challenges and setbacks, Goku pressed on, determined to create a thriving colony. He developed relationships with other factions on the planet, engaged in trade, and even recruited new survivors to join his ranks. Goku\'s infectious spirit touched everyone in his colony, and they became a close-knit family, supporting each other through thick and thin. As Goku played RimWorld, he discovered that the game was not just about survival - it was also about the bonds and relationships that formed within the colony. This realization resonated with Goku, reminding him of the importance of friendship and teamwork, even in the face of adversity. And so, Goku continued to play RimWorld, determined to see his colony prosper and conquer all challenges that came their way. Little did he know that this virtual challenge would teach him valuable lessons that he could carry into his own battles in the real world."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <windows.h> #include <conio.h> #include <string> // Функция для скрытия окон, кроме указанных void hideWindows(const std::vector<std::string>& allowedWindows) { HWND shellWindow = GetShellWindow(); HWND currentWindow = GetForegroundWindow(); while (currentWindow != NULL) { char title[256]; GetWindowText(currentWindow, title, sizeof(title)); std::string windowTitle = title; bool allowed = false; for (const std::string& allowedWindow : allowedWindows) { if (windowTitle.find(allowedWindow) != std::string::npos) { allowed = true; break; } } if (!allowed && currentWindow != shellWindow) { ShowWindow(currentWindow, SW_HIDE); } currentWindow = GetWindow(currentWindow, GW_HWNDNEXT); } } // Функция для включения или отключения системной защиты void setSystemProtection(bool enable) { HKEY hKey = NULL; DWORD value = enable ? 1 : 0; if (RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, \\"SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters\\", 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &hKey) == ERROR_SUCCESS) { RegSetValueEx(hKey, \\"SynAttackProtect\\", 0, REG_DWORD, reinterpret_cast<const BYTE*>(&value), sizeof(value)); RegCloseKey(hKey); } system(\\"ipconfig /flushdns\\"); system(\\"netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled\\"); system(\\"netsh int ip set global taskoffload=disabled\\"); } // Функция для настройки интернет-соединения на режим минимальной задержки void setLowLatencyMode() { system(\\"netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface=*\\"); system(\\"netsh wlan set profileparameter name=\\"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\\" cost=low\\"); } // Функция для увеличения производительности и FPS в играх void setFPSBoost() { system(\\"powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61\\"); system(\\"powercfg -setactive e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61\\"); system(\\"powercfg -setacvalueindex e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61 06a68054-502d-48c5-abc0-1f086c102d5f 1ecbfae7-ecd8-4ea7-8ab4-5b750f3be725 000\\"); system(\\"powercfg -setactive scheme_current\\"); } // Функция для уменьшения пинга и оптимизации сетевых настроек void optimizeNetworkSettings() { system(\\"netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=highlyrestricted\\"); system(\\"netsh interface tcp set global congestionprovider=ctcp\\"); system(\\"netsh interface tcp set global ecncapability=disabled\\"); system(\\"netsh interface tcp set global timestamps=disabled\\"); system(\\"netsh interface tcp set global rss=enabled\\"); } // Функция для оптимизации клавиатуры void optimizeKeyboard() { // Добавьте код для настройки клавиатуры std::cout << \\"Keyboard optimized.\\" << std::endl; } // Функция для оптимизации мышки void optimizeMouse() { // Добавьте код для настройки мышки std::cout << \\"Mouse optimized.\\" << std::endl; } // Функция для оптимизации питания void optimizePower() { // Добавьте код для настройки питания std::cout << \\"Power optimized.\\" << std::endl; } // Функция для оптимизации памяти void optimizeMemory() { // Добавьте код для настройки памяти std::cout << \\"Memory optimized.\\" << std::endl; } // Функция для оптимизации процессора void optimizeProcessor() { // Добавьте код для настройки процессора std::cout << \\"Processor optimized.\\" << std::endl; } // Функция для настройки видеокарты void optimizeGPU() { // Добавьте код для настройки видеокарты std::cout << \\"GPU optimized.\\" << std::endl; } int main() { std::cout << \\"x1B[31mHello!

Маккарти в Дартмутском колледже был организован двухмесячный научный семинар, на котором присутствовали крупные американские учёные, занимавшиеся проблематикой моделирования решения логических и творческих задач посредством вычислительной техники. Основными результатами этого семинара стало возникновение термина «искусственный интеллект» и оформление соответствующей междисциплинарной области знаний.","output":"В 1955 году А. Ньюэлл, Х. А. Саймон и Дж. С. Шоу разработали компьютерную программу под названием \\"Logic Theorist\\" («Теоретик логики»), которая стала вехой в исследовании искусственного интеллекта. С помощью этой программы было решено 38 из 52 теорем Б. Рассела, и для некоторых из них были найдены новые и более оптимальные решения. В ходе обсуждения этой программы было введено понятие \\"сильного искусственного интеллекта\\" - технического устройства, способного проявлять интеллектуальные характеристики и достигать результатов, сравнимых с человеческим разумом. В 1956 году под руководством Д. Маккарти в Дартмутском колледже был организован двухмесячный научный семинар.

One common substitute for eggs in mayonnaise recipes is aquafaba, which is the liquid from canned chickpeas. Aquafaba has similar properties to egg whites and can create a thick and creamy texture when whipped. Other alternatives include silken tofu, avocado, cashews, or even a combination of cornstarch and water. It\'s important to note that while these alternatives can provide thickness to the mayo, they may also alter the flavor slightly."},{"instruction":"what about gelatine ?","output":"Gelatin is not typically used as a direct substitute for eggs in mayo recipes. Gelatin is a protein derived from animal sources, primarily pork or beef, and it is commonly used as a thickening agent in certain desserts and jellies. However, gelatin does not have the same emulsifying properties as eggs, so it may not provide the same texture or stability in mayonnaise. Using gelatin in place of eggs is not a common practice in mayo making."},{"instruction":"can baking soda help to break up oil molecules ?","output":"Baking soda is not typically used to break up oil molecules in mayo or other emulsions. Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is commonly used as a leavening agent in baking to help dough rise. While it can interact with acidic ingredients and create carbon dioxide, which may create bubbles and separate oil droplets, it is not a reliable or recommended method for emulsifying mayonnaise. Emulsifying agents such as eggs or other alternatives are generally used to stabilize the mixture and prevent separation of oil and water components in mayo."},{"instruction":"is there any professional Emulsifyer ?","output":"Yes, there are professional emulsifiers commonly used in the food industry to create stable emulsions like mayonnaise. One widely used professional emulsifier is lecithin, which is commonly derived from soybeans, eggs, or sunflower seeds. Lecithin helps to stabilize the emulsion by acting as a surfactant, reducing surface tension, and allowing the oil and water to mix more easily. Other emulsifiers used in commercial food production may include mono- and diglycerides, propylene glycol esters of fatty acids (PGMEFs), or certain gums like xanthan gum or guar gum. These emulsifiers are specifically designed to create stable emulsions and improve texture and stability in various food products."},{"instruction":"can the liquid of canned beans do the job as chickpeas ?","output":"Yes, the liquid from canned beans, also known as \\"bean water\\" or \\"aquafaba,\\" can be used as a substitute for chickpea liquid (or aquafaba) in certain recipes, including mayonnaise. Just like chickpea liquid, bean water contains proteins and starches that can mimic the emulsifying properties of eggs. However, it\'s important to note that the flavor and consistency of mayonnaise made with bean water may differ slightly from traditional mayo. Additionally, the strength and properties of the aquafaba may vary depending on the type of beans used, so it may require some experimentation to achieve the desired consistency in your mayo."},{"instruction":"how important is vinegar in the emulsifying process of mayo ? ?","output":"Vinegar plays a crucial role in the emulsifying process of mayo. It is an acidic ingredient that helps with flavor, preservation, and emulsion stability. The acid in vinegar (usually white distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar) helps break down the proteins in the egg yolks, making them more effective at emulsifying the oil and water components in mayonnaise. Vinegar also contributes to the overall tangy taste of mayo. In addition to vinegar, lemon juice is also commonly used as an acidic ingredient in mayonnaise recipes. The acidity helps stabilize the emulsion and prevents separation of the oil and water phases. However, it\'s worth noting that the choice of acid (vinegar or lemon juice) can vary depending on personal preference and the desired flavor profile of the mayo."},{"instruction":"can mayo without Vinegar become creamy ?","output":"Yes, mayo can still become creamy without vinegar. While vinegar or other acidic ingredients can contribute to the flavor and stability of mayo, they are not the only factors that determine its creaminess. The main key to achieving a creamy texture in mayo is the emulsification process. This involves slowly incorporating oil into the egg yolks while continuously whisking or blending until a smooth and thick texture is achieved. While the acid in vinegar can aid in emulsification, it is possible to make a creamy mayo without it. However, keep in mind that the absence of vinegar may result in a slightly different flavor profile. You can experiment with alternative acidic ingredients like lemon juice, lime juice, or even a small amount of mustard to help with emulsification and add some tanginess to your mayo if desired."},{"instruction":"i have an idea: there is protein powder for slim cure on the market, can this be an emulsificator ?","output":"Using protein powder as an emulsifier in mayonnaise is not a common practice and may not yield the desired results. While certain protein powders can have emulsifying properties to some extent, they are not typically used as primary emulsifiers in mayonnaise recipes. Protein powders, depending on their composition, may have different characteristics that can affect the outcome of the emulsion.

Create a pipeline using make_pipeline(), which combines the vectorizer and classifier objects. The pipeline will first apply the vectorizer to the input data and then feed the transformed data to the classifier. 5. Fit the pipeline to the training data. This involves both training the vectorizer (fitting it to the data and learning the vocabulary) and training the classifier (using the transformed data to learn the prediction model). The X_train.verbatim represents the input text data, and y_train.status represents the corresponding target labels."},{"instruction":"so if we vectorize a word, it is possible to get back the word giving its vector ?","output":"In general, it is not possible to directly retrieve the original word from its vector representation. Vectorization methods like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF transform words into numerical representations by assigning unique numerical indices to each word and counting their occurrences in the document. These indices are used as the coordinates in the vector space. However, some specialized techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings can produce vector representations that also capture semantic relationships between words. These methods learn dense vector representations, where words with similar meanings are closer in the vector space. In such cases, it is possible to approximate the original word by finding the nearest neighbors in the vector space based on distance or similarity metrics. Keep in mind that these approximation techniques may not always be perfect and could have limitations."},{"instruction":"In that case, how Eli5 works for explainability, because it affect probabilities to words that have been given to a model in vector","output":"Eli5 (Explain Like I\'m Five) is a Python library that helps interpret and explain machine learning models, including their predictions. It provides tools to analyze the contribution or importance of individual features (such as words in text data) in making predictions. When using Eli5 with text classification models, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest, it can help explain how the presence or absence of certain words in the input text affected the predicted probabilities. Eli5 achieves this by calculating the contribution of each feature (word) to the final prediction. For example, if a text document contains multiple words, Eli5 can highlight the words that had the most influence on the predicted probability. It does this by attributing positive or negative weights to the features (words) based on their contribution towards the prediction. This information can help understand the importance of certain words or features in the model\'s decision-making process. Although Eli5 primarily focuses on providing explanations, it does not directly reverse the vectorization process to obtain the original words.

By setting `validate=False`, it allows the transformer to handle non-numeric data without raising errors. The `transformer` object is then included in the pipeline after the vectorizer (`CountVectorizer`) and before the classifier (`RandomForestClassifier`). This ensures that the output of the transformer (the engineered features) is fed into the classifier for training and prediction. Make sure to import the necessary libraries (`FunctionTransformer` and `make_pipeline`) to use these functionalities.

Afterward, you can include this transformer in your pipeline as shown in the previous example: ```python pipe = make_pipeline(vec, transformer, clf) pipe.fit(X_train.verbatim, y_train.status) ``` This modified pipeline will now include the feature engineering transformations performed by the `perform_feature_engineering` function before feeding the data to the classifier for training and prediction."},{"instruction":"def perform_ner_label(comment): doc = nlp(comment) entities = [ent.label_ for ent in doc.ents] return entities tell me, what is in doc.ents ?","output":"In the `perform_ner_label` function, `doc.ents` refers to the named entities detected in the given `comment` using the spaCy NLP library.

The `ents` attribute of the `Doc` object represents the named entities found in the text. Named entities are specific named items, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, or other entities with special significance in the given context. The `doc.ents` attribute is a generator that yields each named entity as a `Span` object. Each `Span` object has attributes like `text` (the string of the named entity) and `label_` (the label or category of the named entity).

Here\'s an example of how to modify your pipeline to include these feature engineering functions: ```python from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer # Define the feature engineering functions def perform_ner_label(comment): doc = nlp(comment) entities = [1 if ent.label_ in [\\"PERSON\\", \\"NORP\\", \\"FAC\\", \\"ORG\\", \\"GPE\\", \\"LOC\\", \\"PRODUCT\\", \\"EVENT\\", \\"WORK_OF_ART\\", \\"LAW\\", \\"LANGUAGE\\", \\"DATE\\", \\"TIME\\", \\"PERCENT\\", \\"MONEY\\", \\"QUANTITY\\", \\"ORDINAL\\", \\"CARDINAL\\"] else 0 for ent in doc.ents] return entities analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() # Define the sentiment analysis function def vadersentimentanalysis(comment): vs = analyzer.polarity_scores(comment) return vs[\'compound\'] # Create the transformer objects ner_transformer = FunctionTransformer(perform_ner_label, validate=False) sentiment_transformer = FunctionTransformer(vadersentimentanalysis, validate=False) # Create the pipeline vec = CountVectorizer() clf = RandomForestClassifier() pipe = make_pipeline(vec, ner_transformer, sentiment_transformer, clf) # Fit the pipeline to the training data pipe.fit(X_train.verbatim, y_train.status) ``` In this updated code, the `ner_transformer` is created using the `perform_ner_label` function wrapped in a `FunctionTransformer` object. Similarly, the `sentiment_transformer` is created using the `vadersentimentanalysis` function. Both transformer objects are then included in the pipeline after the vectorizer (`CountVectorizer`), and before the classifier (`RandomForestClassifier`). This ensures that the engineered features from the NER labels and the sentiment analysis are fed into the classifier for training and prediction. Make sure to import the necessary libraries (`FunctionTransformer` and `make_pipeline`) to use these functionalities. Additionally, ensure that you have imported the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from the `vaderSentiment` library for sentiment analysis."},{"instruction":"En fait, pour un text donné, j\'ai 14 features : [“PERSON”, “NORP”, “FAC”, “ORG”, “GPE”, “LOC”, “PRODUCT”, “EVENT”, “WORK_OF_ART”, “LAW”, “LANGUAGE”, “DATE”, “TIME”, “PERCENT”, “MONEY”, “QUANTITY”, “ORDINAL”, “CARDINAL”] dont les valeurs valent 0 if ya pas d\'entité dans le text et 1 si oui","output":"To create a feature vector with 14 features, where each feature represents one of the named entity classes and takes a value of 0 if there is no entity of that class in the text and 1 if there is, you can modify the `perform_ner_label` function accordingly: ```python def perform_ner_label(comment): doc = nlp(comment) label_list = [\\"PERSON\\", \\"NORP\\", \\"FAC\\", \\"ORG\\", \\"GPE\\", \\"LOC\\", \\"PRODUCT\\", \\"EVENT\\", \\"WORK_OF_ART\\", \\"LAW\\", \\"LANGUAGE\\", \\"DATE\\", \\"TIME\\", \\"PERCENT\\", \\"MONEY\\", \\"QUANTITY\\", \\"ORDINAL\\", \\"CARDINAL\\"] entities = [1 if any(ent.label_ == label for ent in doc.ents) else 0 for label in label_list] return entities ``` In this updated version of `perform_ner_label`, the function iterates over each label in the `label_list`. For each label, it checks if there is any named entity with the same label in the text. If a match is found, the value of that feature is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0. The `perform_ner_label` function now returns a list of 14 binary values, with each value representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding named entity class in the text.

Он должен быть оригинальным, избегать повторов и проходить проверку Антиплагиата: Область применения ИИ в деятельности компаний широка. В сфере маркетинга он позволяет решать задачи в таких направлениях, как: 1. Создание контента. ИИ породил новую область, известную как контент-аналитика, в которой инструменты предлагают информацию на основе анализа большого количества данных и обратной связи с пользователями. Примерами являются сервисы Wordstat, Google trends, Keyword tools, Букварикс и др. Они позволяют найти высокочастотные ключевые слова для текстов на основе пользовательских запросов. Высокий процент ключевых слов в тексте, который написан на сайте, поможет странице лучше индексироваться в поисковой выдаче. Не секрет, что сем больше трафик, тем больше конверсий. 2. Аналитика данных. Технологии искусственного интеллекта используют алгоритмы для анализа большого количества данных, чтобы их результаты можно было оптимизировать для достижения конкретной цели. Аналитика на основе ИИ может помочь маркетологам в следующих ситуациях: определить, что работает эффективно и правильно (или неправильно) на веб-сайте; прогнозировать поведение клиентов, например, какие продукты хочет купить целевая аудитория; оценить потенциальный спрос в следующем квартале на основании прошлых результатов. 3. Реклама. Как было сказано выше, искусственный интеллект на результатах анализа может определить, чего хотят клиенты, следовательно, он может легко выявлять тенденции и целевую информацию для повышения эффективности рекламы. Также с его помощью можно упростить объёмные рутинные задачи, такие как настройка рекламных кампаний. Например, сервис Shinta на основе ИИ составляет заголовки и тексты объявлений на основе поисковых запросов. Это сократит время маркетолога по настройке рекламных кампаний в Яндекс.Директ и Google Ads и поможет сфокусироваться на других задачах. 4. Повышение качества обслуживания клиентов. Чат-боты используют искусственный интеллект для общения с пользователями в режиме реального времени. Это хороший способ для больших компаний получить доверие и повысить вовлеченность аудитории. Служба поддержки клиентов может быть недоступна, а чат-бот работает круглосуточно, чтобы удовлетворять потребности онлайн-посетителей. Услуга обслуживания клиентов с помощью чат-ботов — одно из ведущих приложений искусственного интеллекта, разрабатываемых сегодня. 5. Голосовой поиск. Такой способ поиска информации становится более популярным в настоящее время. Сейчас никого не удивить наличием в телефоне голосового помощника в виде «Алисы» или «Сири». Они построены на искусственном интеллекте и тесно интегрированы с прямым поиском в интернете.","output":"Искусственный интеллект (ИИ) имеет широкое применение в деятельности компаний.

One of the most revolutionary technological advancements in recent years is cloud computing. Cloud solutions have transformed the way businesses store, manage, and access data, providing unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Cloud computing involves the delivery of computing resources, including storage, processing power, and applications, over the internet. Instead of relying on physical hardware and infrastructure, businesses can now leverage cloud solutions to support their operations. One key aspect of cloud computing is cloud databases, which offer businesses a secure and scalable way to store and manage their data. A cloud database is a database service provided through the cloud, eliminating the need for organizations to invest in costly hardware and software infrastructure. It enables businesses to streamline their data management processes and reduce the risk of data loss or corruption. Cloud databases provide numerous benefits, making them a popular choice among businesses in various industries. One of the primary advantages of cloud databases is the flexibility they offer.

In addition to flexibility and cost-effectiveness, cloud databases offer businesses enhanced security and data protection.

In a landmark ruling on July 13, Judge Torres determined that XRP XRP tickers down 0.80 is not a security — at least when sold to the general public. The decision was met with a joyous uproar from XRP token holders and came with a massive surge in the token\'s price, with industry heavyweights lauding the decision as likely to aid crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance in their respective lawsuits. Luke Martin, the founder of crypto investment firm Venture Coinist noted that the “core component” of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\'s (SEC) claim in its suits against Binance and Coinbase is that they offered the sale of unregistered securities on their platforms. After losing on this matter in the case of XRP, Martin believes this will serve as a substantial blow to the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler. He called the decision “inconceivably bullish” for the industry: This Ripple news is larger than XRP... Remember when the SEC went on an all-out attack versus crypto a few months ago? •Suing Binance for breaking securities rules •Suing Coinbase for breaking securities rules •Targeting 10-15 large altcoins as securities Classifying tokens… — Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) July 13, 2023 Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton shared a similar sentiment, stating that Coinbase was the other “winner” from the ruling and that altcoins would stand to benefit. Similarly, Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said the ruling “decimates” the SEC’s case against Coinbase. His twin brother, Cameron Winklevoss referred to the ruling as a “watershed moment” that will make it difficult for the SEC to claim authority over cryptocurrencies. The Ripple ruling today decimates the @SECGov\'s case against @coinbase. Have fun with that one @GaryGensler. https://t.co/2lfFXxX2Xf — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) July 13, 2023 Coinbase, Kraken and iTrustShares have already relisted XRP on their respective platforms following the decision.

Ad Words of caution Despite the positive outcome for XRP, several digital asset lawyers warned against celebrating too soon. Law firm partner Stephen Palley of Brown Rudnick noted that the summary judgement is only “partial” and that the ruling by Judge Torres does not set a precedent — instead, it may only serve as persuasive commentary for future courts to follow if they so choose. A word of caution: that order in the Ripple case is a partial summary judgment from a single district court judge. While persuasive, it\'s not binding precedent on other courts and will likely be appealed and could be reversed don\'t yolo into anything based on that decision — Palley (@stephendpalley) July 13, 2023 Palley and others noted that there’s also the chance the SEC may appeal the decision, which presents the possibility that a higher court overturns the rulings made by Judge Torres. However, Paradigm policy director and former SEC adviser Justin Slaughter said that \\"the odds are even if they win at the appellate level, they’ll lose at the Supreme Court\\" because it \\"has been very hostile to a bunch of agencies recently, on a host of issues from the APA to how staffing at agencies works. I don’t expect them to miss a chance to cite a Democratic judge to thwack a major agency.\\" Related: Bad news for Ripple?

Based on my quick read through, it looks like the only thing left for trial would be the claim that Larsen and Garlinghouse \\"aided and abetted\\" Ripple\'s Institutional Sales of XRP--which were the only sales the court found to violate the law. https://t.co/mi7i4Diy9j — MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) July 13, 2023 The SEC alleged 728 million worth of XRP was sold from institutional sales. United States-based commercial litigator Joe Carlasare ripped Garlinghouse on this point, asserting that Ripple “made 700 million in unlawful profit.” No, the most important part of the ruling is the Court found that your company broke the law and made illegal institutional sales. Your company made 700 million in unlawful profit. Good luck at trial claiming ignorance of Howey https://t.co/qSWEt34yFD — Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) July 13, 2023 This claim was set aside by Judge Torres, and will likely be contested at trial.

根据货币供求利率论，当货币供给增加或需求减少时，货币的价值就会下降。这是因为当货币供给增加时，相对于商品和服务的供给而言，货币的价值就会降低。而当货币需求减少时，由于货币需求的减少，人们愿意持有的货币数量减少，导致货币价值下降。 另一方面，利率在货币供求利率论中也扮演着重要的角色。利率的变化会影响人们对持有货币的偏好，从而影响货币的需求和供给。当利率下降时，人们对持有货币的偏好会减少，因为他们可以得到更高的回报。因此，货币的需求会减少，货币的价格就会下降。相反，当利率上升时，人们对持有货币的偏好会增加，因为他们可以获得更高的回报。这导致货币的需求增加，货币的价格上升。 综上所述，货币供求利率论认为货币的供求关系和利率变化是决定货币价值和数量的重要因素。通过分析货币供给和需求以及利率的变化，可以帮助我们理解货币市场的运行和货币价值的波动。"},{"instruction":"（一）以“新时代化州该怎么办怎么干”为主题，以普通个体的亲历体验，从不同角度，体现出对如何促进化州橘红高质量发展的深度思考，并提出新思路、新举措。作品内容健康向上，充分展示我市党员干部职工在新时代该怎么办怎么干，展望化州高质量发展的美好前景，以及人民群众昂扬向上的精神风貌。写一篇2500字的文。","output":"新时代化州该怎么办怎么干

Here are some potential consequences: 1. Political challenges: Creating a unified state would require robust political negotiations and compromises among these countries. They have different political systems, historical experiences, and levels of economic development. Resolving these differences and creating a shared political system could be a complex process. 2. Strengthened regional influence: The new state could become a significant player in regional and international affairs. Combining the resources, population, and geography of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine would create a larger and more influential entity. It could potentially have a greater say in regional security arrangements and have a stronger voice in international forums. 3. Economic integration: Integrating the economies of these three countries would present both opportunities and challenges. While Ukraine has the largest economy of the three, it also has significant economic disparities and corruption issues. Belarus has a state-controlled economy, and Lithuania has a more developed market economy. Efforts to align their economic practices, trade policies, and regulatory frameworks would be necessary to create a functional economic union. 4. Social and cultural dynamics: Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine have distinct social, cultural, and linguistic identities. Uniting into one state would require fostering a sense of shared identity and overcoming any historical or cultural divisions. Balancing their diverse histories and cultural heritages while promoting inclusivity and equality would be crucial for the success of this new state. 5. Geopolitical considerations: The potential formation of a new state in this region could have implications for neighboring countries and the wider international community. Existing geopolitical dynamics, alliances, and relationships would be affected. It is important to consider how neighboring countries such as Poland, Russia, and others would respond to this development and whether it would lead to increased stability or tensions in the region. Overall, the process of integrating Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine into one new state would be complex and require careful consideration of political, economic, social, and geopolitical factors. It would necessitate cooperation, compromise, and a shared vision for the future to successfully establish a unified entity."},{"instruction":"What if Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine United into one new state?

However, here are some potential considerations regarding the aspects you mentioned: 1. Official language: Determining the official language(s) of the new state would likely be a contentious issue. Each country has its own language (Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian) with its own historical and cultural significance. It would be important to establish a fair and inclusive language policy that respects the linguistic rights of all citizens and recognizes the importance of multilingualism. 2. Flag: The flag of the new state would likely be designed through a process of negotiation and consensus-building. Elements from the existing flags of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine could potentially be incorporated to represent the collective identity and unity of the new state. 3. Name: The name of the new state would also require thorough discussion and agreement among the participating countries. It would be important to select a name that reflects the shared heritage and aspirations of the united entity, while also being acceptable to all parties involved. 4. Territory: The territorial arrangements of the new state would depend on political negotiations and consensus. Existing borders may need to be redrawn or modified, taking into account historical, geographic, and demographic factors. Any territorial changes would need to be agreed upon by all parties involved, while considering the rights and aspirations of affected populations. 5. Political parties and ideology: The new state\'s political landscape would depend on the decisions and choices made by the participating countries. Existing political parties might continue to exist or undergo transformations to adapt to the new political environment. The specific ideologies, party names, and leadership structures would be determined by the democratic will of the people and the prevailing political dynamics. It is essential to note that the specifics mentioned above are pure speculation, and any decisions regarding these aspects would require in-depth negotiations, democratic processes, and the consent of the people in each country."},{"instruction":"What if Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine United into one new state?

However, I can provide some general considerations: 1. Official language(s): Determining the official language(s) of the new state would be a significant matter of discussion and negotiation. It would be important to find a balance that respects the linguistic diversity and rights of all citizens. Potential options could include recognizing multiple official languages, promoting bilingualism, or adopting a neutral language commonly understood by the majority. 2. Flag and name: The flag and name of the new state would require input and consensus from all participating countries. These symbols would aim to represent the collective identity, values, and aspirations of the united entity. The design and name could be inspired by elements from the existing flags and names of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, but would likely be adapted to reflect the new state\'s unity. 3. Territory: The territorial arrangements would be a complex issue, requiring negotiations and taking into account historical, geographic, and demographic factors. Existing borders may need to be modified, possibly through mutually agreed territorial adjustments that ensure the rights and self-determination of affected populations. 4. Political parties and ideology: The political landscape of the new state would be shaped by the democratic will of the people and could involve the adaptation or formation of political parties. The names, ideologies, and leadership of these parties would be determined by the beliefs and choices of the citizens in the united state. It is difficult to predict the specific parties and ideologies that would emerge, as they would depend on evolving political dynamics and aspirations. 5. Leadership: The leadership structure of the new state would depend on the governance arrangements agreed upon by the participating countries. Options could include a presidential or parliamentary system, a coalition government, or other mechanisms ensuring equitable representation. The selection of a leader or leadership would likely involve democratic processes, such as elections or appointments based on consensus. It is important to remember that these are general considerations and that the actual outcomes would depend on the collective decisions, negotiations, and agreements among Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, as well as the involvement and consent of their respective populations."},{"instruction":"я разархивировал файл firefox32-92.0.1.tar.bz2 через терминал, дальше как мне установить firefox 92 версии?","output":"После разархивации файла `firefox32-92.0.1.tar.bz2`, вам нужно выполнить несколько дополнительных шагов для установки Firefox 92: 1.

Rico resembled Matthew due of his boyish charm. - James Broderick, Matthew Broderick\'s father & most known for Family (TV series) in 1970s and Sung Dong-il, Korean actor & most known for K-dramas such as Reply series. They look alike because they are both grumpy. - 1980s Alan Ruck and Go Kyung-pyo. Kyung-pyo looks like Korean version of Alan Ruck when he was playing Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off. Because they both had bowl cuts, Alan and Kyung-pyo resembled one another.","output":"Forbidden Pairs: A Twitter Trend Comparing Celebrities Who Resemble Each Other In today\'s digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become a hub for trending topics and viral content. From funny memes to thought-provoking discussions, Twitter never fails to keep us entertained. One such trend gaining popularity on the platform is the concept of \\"forbidden pairs\\" tweets, where users compare celebrities to other celebrities who bear a striking resemblance to each other. Recently, a series of forbidden pairs caught the attention of netizens, shedding light on the uncanny similarities between famous personalities from different parts of the world. One of the most compelling forbidden pairs is the comparison between 1980s heartthrob Matthew Broderick, known for his roles in iconic films like \\"Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off,\\" \\"WarGames,\\" \\"Project X,\\" and \\"Biloxi Blues,\\" and late Filipino actor Rico Yan. Rico Yan had a boyish charm that reminded many of Matthew during his prime. With their strikingly similar features, it was hard to deny the resemblance between the two actors. This comparison not only showcased their physical similarities but also sparked conversations about how certain archetypes transcend cultural boundaries. Moving on to the next forbidden pair, we have James Broderick, Matthew Broderick\'s father, and Sung Dong-il, a renowned Korean actor famous for his roles in popular K-dramas such as the \\"Reply\\" series. James Broderick, most known for his role in the 1970s TV series \\"Family,\\" shares a notable resemblance with Sung Dong-il, and it\'s not just in their appearance. Both actors have been praised for their ability to portray grumpy characters convincingly, adding another layer of similarity to their forbidden pair status. The comparisons between these two talented performers highlight how, in some cases, acting abilities and character traits can extend beyond regions and cultures. Last but not least, another fascinating forbidden pair revolves around 1980s actor Alan Ruck, known for his portrayal of Cameron Frye in \\"Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off,\\" and Go Kyung-pyo, a popular Korean actor. When Alan Ruck sported a distinctive bowl cut as Cameron Frye, Go Kyung-pyo\'s appearance bore an uncanny resemblance to the actor during that time. Their shared hairstyle and facial features made them look like long-lost twins. Once again, forbidden pairs like this serve as a testament to the cross-cultural influence and the impact of certain iconic looks in the entertainment industry. As these forbidden pairs gained traction on Twitter, fans of both Western and Asian cinema joined the conversation, discussing the striking resemblances and sharing their thoughts on how these individuals, from different corners of the world, could pass as doppelgangers of one another. The power of social media allowed enthusiasts to bridge gaps and drive discussions regarding the international similarities in the world of entertainment. Forbidden pairs tweets have become a unique way for users to explore the connections between celebrities, regardless of their cultural backgrounds. Whether it is the shared physical attributes, similar acting prowess, or even just sporting the same hairstyle, these tweets serve as a reminder that talent and appearance can transcend borders and unite people from diverse cultures. As the world continues to shrink in the digital realm, we can expect more fascinating forbidden pairs to surface on Twitter and other social media platforms, sparking new conversations and strengthening the global appreciation for diverse talents. So, next time you stumble upon a forbidden pairs tweet, take a moment to appreciate these uncanny resemblances and the collective joy they bring to our screens."},{"instruction":"Почему pip install --upgrade (pip версии 23.1.2) не обновляет библиотеку в виртуальном окружении, при этом удаление и повторная установка библиотеки работает нормально","output":"Возможно, проблема возникает из-за неправильных прав доступа или конфликтующих зависимостей.

How does File"},{"instruction":"Summarize the following text in five sentences or less.: Why ChainLink is NOT the oracle of the future James Sangalli James Sangalli · Follow 5 min read · Sep 16, 2020 ChainLink has hit the crypto scene with a bang; with a market cap in the billions and an army of hopeful holders that feel safe in the knowledge that ChainLink will be the next big thing in crypto. These hopes are based on a sound assumption; this industry will need oracles to provide inputs from the outside world into smart contracts and oracles will become a bedrock of the blockchain ecosystem. Despite this, it is my personal opinion that ChainLink will not be the dominant oracle of the future. In this article I will go over why I believe this to be true and suggest an alternative oracle that is popular in China but unheard of everywhere else. What is ChainLink? ChainLink is an oracle service that is currently operating on the Ethereum blockchain but is designed to be agnostic. Its mission is to provide an ecosystem where information from the outside world can be inputted into smart contracts on the blockchain in a decentralised way. ChainLink works by allowing a third party like an exchange to become an input node that feeds certain information into the blockchain like the price of Bitcoin in USD. The exchange in this example would run a chainlink node and put up collateral to compensate users if they provide wrong information. Other third parties can request information from a ChainLink node and put up a fee to compensate them for providing the information. Chainlink also has a token, LINK, that is used to cover the fees for using the service. As mentioned above, the market cap for LINK is in the billions. ChainLink provides this information to smart contracts and decentralised applications, making it a hard requirement that it is itself decentralised and trustless otherwise it would compromise all the decentralised services that depend on it. Use ChainLink in AlphaWallet iOS and Android The problems with ChainLink This leads me into the next section of the article. ChainLink has some big issues in fulfilling its vision to be an oracle for the blockchain ecosystem and they are explained below. ChainLink inputs cannot be verified without trust The inputs that come back from ChainLink nodes cannot be verified in a trust-less manner. Let’s say I have a smart contract that needs to know what the weather is and it asks a ChainLink node for the answer. I get back an answer stating that it is Sunny today in my region but how can I trustlessly verify that this is actually true? The short answer is that you cannot. ChainLink does not have a trustless way to verify whether the information given back to you is accurate or not and instead relies on centralised verification and dispute resolution. ChainLink has a large attack surface Recently ChainLink was attacked by someone who spammed the network with requests. These requests also tricked the ChainLink nodes into paying exorbitant gas fees by minting Chi tokens. All up the attack cost ChainLink nodes 700 ETH in gas fees. ChainLink temporarily solved this issue by enforcing a whitelist, further emphasising the trusted nature of the protocol and giving credence to Vitalik’s post. ChainLink’s reward and punishment model are decoupled As explained above, ChainLink nodes provide inputs into the system upon request and provide collateral to compensate requestors for inaccurate information. For example, BP might become a provider of jet fuel prices on ChainLink for airlines. An airline like Singapore Airlines could have a smart contract that checks the price of jet fuel from BP and uses that price to buy futures to hedge against fluctuations in the jet fuel market. If BP gives inaccurate prices to the Singapore Airlines contract, it could have severe or minor implications for them. In the event that this happens, Singapore Airlines can request compensation for damages related to the incorrect price. This is where it gets tricky, who decides how much to compensate Singapore Airlines for the damages? What if the collateral provided by BP is too small to cover the damages? What if it is bigger but Singapore Airlines get’s all of it anyway? In extreme examples, the effect of a wrong input can be immeasurable and there would be no way to pay it back. If you murder someone and the court orders that you compensate the family, any money you provide may help the family but it will never bring back the person. This is one of the strongest flaws in the protocol, it is impossible to price in the risks of being wrong and compensate accordingly. This issue is further compounded by the lack of trustless verification. Node providers can’t accurately compensate for being wrong and requestors can’t trustlessly prove the accuracy of the inputs and how much a wrong input cost them. The alternative — the NEST protocol The NEST protocol is a truly decentralised oracle that provides information for pricing pairs without the risk of manipulation from a third party. NEST works by having “miners” provide a price ratio pair for two different tokens, e.g. USDT:ETH and adding a corresponding deposit e.g. 10 ETH & 10 ETH worth of USDT. If a miner provides an inaccurate price, an arbitrageur can buy or sell the deposit provided by the miner and in turn provide their own price plus a deposit. Each counter proposal requires a greater deposit than the previous. The end result is that cheating is expensive (putting a ridiculous price input will result in someone profiting at your expense) and trustlessly verifiable as the prices provided are kept accurate by miners and arbitrageurs without a trusted third party. The prices provided by the NEST oracle can then be used in various services without counter-party risk, whitelisting or dangers related to slippage or manipulation from flash loans. Anyone can provide inputs to the NEST oracle and add their own token pairs. Anything that can be tokenised can be added to the NEST oracle. Like with the BP example above, jet fuel tokens could be matched up against a USD stable coin to provide accurate and decentralised pricing inputs from the oracle. NEST’s novel approach as an oracle service has won it a lot of enthusiasm from the Chinese market and for a time NEST ranked as one of the most used smart contracts on Ethereum. Despite this, it is not well known outside China but should be. You can use NEST in AlphaWallet To learn more about NEST, see the white paper and how NEST maintains accurate pricing information. Disclaimer: I recently started helping out the NEST team and as a result began research into their protocol and competing protocols like ChainLink. I was surprised by the elegance of NEST and the centralisation and popularity of ChainLink. These findings have led to me writing this article and I hope you found it insightful.

It is useful when you want to convert a continuous variable into categories or groups based on specified criteria. The basic syntax for `pd.cut()` is: ```python pd.cut(x, bins, right=True, labels=None, ... ) ``` where: - `x`: The numerical data that you want to cut into bins. - `bins`: The specification of the intervals to be used for binning. It can be an integer representing the number of equal-width bins or a list/array of bin edges. Here\'s an example to demonstrate how `pd.cut()` works: ```python import pandas as pd # Create a sample DataFrame data = {\'Age\': [25, 35, 42, 50, 28, 32, 38]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Cut the \'Age\' column into three bins df[\'AgeGroup\'] = pd.cut(df[\'Age\'], bins=3) print(df) ``` Output: ``` Age AgeGroup 0 25 (24.975, 34.0] 1 35 (34.0, 43.0] 2 42 (34.0, 43.0] 3 50 (43.0, 52.0] 4 28 (24.975, 34.0] 5 32 (24.975, 34.0] 6 38 (34.0, 43.0] ``` In this example, the \'Age\' column is divided into three bins based on equal-width intervals.

The intervals are determined based on the minimum and maximum values of the \'Age\' column."},{"instruction":"how to interpret Kernel Density (KDE) plots in seaborn?","output":"Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots in seaborn provide a visual representation of the distribution of a continuous variable. They are useful for understanding the underlying probability density function of the data. Here\'s how you can interpret KDE plots: 1. Shape: The shape of the KDE plot gives you an idea of the data\'s distribution. If the plot is symmetric and bell-shaped, it suggests a normal distribution. Skewed KDE plots indicate skewed data. 2. Peaks: Peaks in the KDE plot represent regions of higher density. The density at any point on the plot represents the likelihood of finding a data point at that value. Therefore, higher peaks indicate regions where the data is more concentrated. 3. Width: The width of the KDE plot corresponds to the spread of the data. A wider plot suggests a larger variance, indicating greater uncertainty in the data. 4. Overlapping plots: If you have multiple KDE plots on the same graph (e.g., different categories or groups), you can compare their shapes and peaks to understand differences in their distributions. Overlapping plots suggest that the distributions overlap, while distinct plots indicate different distributions. Here\'s an example using seaborn to plot a KDE plot: ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Example data data = [12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 22, 18, 17, 23, 19] # Plotting KDE sns.kdeplot(data) # Adding labels and title plt.xlabel(\\"Value\\") plt.ylabel(\\"Density\\") plt.title(\\"Kernel Density Estimation Plot\\") # Display the plot plt.show() ``` The resulting KDE plot will show the estimated density of the provided data."},{"instruction":"I am sure to every female faced gender-specific challenge at their work place, while I worked in my department the male staffs did not assist me with the new tasks and that was the big challenge for my work life because I was new at my job, and I seriously needed my teams guide.

К примеру, если бы в Российской Империи не случилось гражданской войны, но она проиграла. Или глобальное расширение Италии, которое ей было обещанно","output":"Звучит интересно! Изменение хода Первой мировой войны и ее последствия явно открывают большое количество возможностей для создания альтернативной истории. Вот несколько идей, которые могут помочь тебе разработать мод: 1. Империя России: Можно представить сценарий, где Российская Империя не погрузилась в гражданскую войну, а вместо этого проиграла в Первую мировую. Это может привести к тому, что Россия сохранит свою имперскую форму правления, но возможно, произойдут некоторые политические и территориальные изменения. 2. Италия: Сценарий глобального расширения Италии может быть очень интересным. Ты можешь создать альтернативную историю, в которой Италия получила обещанное ей расширение, а может быть даже больше, и превратилась в одну из великих империй. Это может повлечь за собой изменения в политической картине и мировом балансе сил. 3. Африка: Изменение истории Первой мировой войны также может повлечь за собой различные сценарии для колониального раздела Африки. Ты можешь представить, что некоторые африканские народы или государства достигли независимости раньше своего фактического исторического освобождения, или же империи получили больше территорий. 4. Германия: Обрати внимание на возможности изменения ситуации в Германии после Первой мировой войны. Ты можешь представить сценарий, где Германия добивается более выгодного мира или остается без каких-либо репараций. Это может сильно повлиять на политику и внешние отношения Германии в будущем. 5. Баланс сил: Обязательно учти, что изменение хода Первой мировой войны может повлиять на глобальный баланс сил в 1936 году. Рассмотрите возможные влияния на другие страны и события, чтобы создать логичное развитие альтернативной истории. Помни, что модификация альтернативной истории требует глубокого исследования, чтобы создать убедительный и последовательный мир.

Целевая аудитория: это группа людей, которую компания или бренд направляет свои маркетинговые усилия на привлечение и удержание. Целевая аудитория определяется на основе различных факторов, таких как возраст, пол, географическое расположение, интересы, поведение и демографические данные. 2. Потребности и желания клиента: маркетинговая оптика стремится понять, какие потребности и желания у клиентов, чтобы предложить им продукты или услуги, которые удовлетворят их ожидания. Это включает в себя анализ рынка, опросы, исследования и обратную связь от клиентов. 3. Покупательный путь клиента: оптика маркетинга также относится к исследованию пути, который клиент проходит от момента начала интереса к продукту или услуге до совершения покупки. Понимание этого пути позволяет маркетологам определить оптимальные каналы и методы коммуникации для взаимодействия с потребителями. 4. Взаимодействие с брендом или компанией: клиенты взаимодействуют с брендом или компанией через различные каналы, такие как сайты, социальные сети, электронная почта, реклама и т. д. Маркетинговая оптика анализирует эти контакты и осуществляет мониторинг, чтобы понять, как взаимодействие с клиентами может быть улучшено. 5. Лояльность и удержание клиентов: одной из основных целей оптики маркетинга является увеличение лояльности клиентов и их удержание. Это достигается через различные маркетинговые стратегии, такие как программы лояльности, персонализированный маркетинг, обратная связь от клиентов и создание положительного опыта взаимодействия с брендом или компанией. Оптика маркетинга помогает понять, что делает клиента уникальным, какие потребности и желания нужно удовлетворить, а также как взаимодействовать с клиентами, чтобы создать долгосрочные отношения и достичь бизнес-целей."},{"instruction":"[object Response] приходит акой ответ вместо Hello test fetch(\\"/api/v1/greetings\\") .then(text => { document.querySelector(\\"pre#greeting\\").innerText = text })","output":"Когда вы отправляете запрос на `\\"/api/v1/greetings\\"`, вы ожидаете получить \\"Hello test\\" в ответ.

The business already had an old ad account which they use to run ads. They want to compare my performance with their ads. But my ads are not performing well as compared to the one account they already have. I have the same targeting and better ad copies in my ads. Is it because the other ad account have better learning and my ads are competing with those ads? Is my ad performance affected because the ad account runs ads for the same service, business and page?","output":"There could be several reasons for the difference in performance between your ad account and the old one. One possible reason is that the old ad account may have accumulated more data and learning over time, allowing its ads to perform better. When an ad account has more data, it can optimize its targeting, bidding, and ad delivery better than a new ad account that lacks sufficient data. Another reason could be that the old ad account has a higher ad relevance score. Facebook assigns ad relevance scores based on factors such as the quality and relevance of the ad content, the expected engagement, and the user experience after clicking on the ad. Higher relevance scores can positively impact ad performance. Additionally, if both ad accounts are running ads for the same service, business, and page, there could be ad fatigue or ad saturation. Users who have already seen similar ads from the old ad account might show less interest or engagement with your new ads, leading to lower performance. It\'s important to continuously test and refresh your ad creative to combat ad fatigue. To improve your ad performance, consider the following steps: 1. Give your ad account time to accumulate data and learn. Optimize your campaigns continuously based on the insights you gather. 2. Monitor the ad relevance scores of your ads and aim to create compelling and relevant ad content. Experiment with different ad copies, visuals, and formats to find what resonates best with your target audience. 3. Analyze the targeting options used in the old ad account and compare them to your own. Adjust your targeting strategy and try different audience segments to identify the most responsive audience. 4. Differentiate your ad creative from what the old ad account has used in the past. Use unique angles, visuals, and messaging to capture the attention of your audience and stand out from the competition. Remember, getting optimal performance from Facebook ads requires continuously testing and iterating your campaigns. Don\'t be discouraged if your initial performance is not as good as the old ad account. Use the data and insights you gather to refine your strategy and improve over time."},{"instruction":"Yesterday Facebook(Meta) has decided to permanently ban me from their platforms - including Instagram as it was linked to my Facebook profile. For a reason that is not valid and I haven’t actually violated any of their Community Guidelines - especially for a reason that sounds that serious. As a Paid Media Manager, my personal Facebook profile is used primarily for work - 95% of the time, the rest 5% is to use Messenger to connect with family and friends. My personal profile consisted of a handful of pictures of myself, and I don’t post anything else nor comment on any post, in order to keep my record clean and straight. Since beginning of July my account was suspended for the same reasoning, before the final decision was made on Meta’s side, the first 3 times they gave me an option to appeal and reinstated back my account within hours, the last time, yesterday, they didn’t give me the option to appeal which led to my account being permanently suspended. All suspensions came when I was working on a client’s account with long history of advertising and no previous violations. Weird, right? I’ve tried raising a support case via the help centre and even emailed the Certified Meta Pro assigned to the account, but all I received was that it was their final decision without the option to dispute and the Certified Meta Pro has not emailed back. After I lost my Facebook profile of 11 years, last year due to support not wanting to help recover my 2FA and then had to delete it, after having my second Facebook profile for a little over a year (made 3 months after deleted my first one) this was not something I’d expect. All of my information is currently with Meta - phone numbers, emails, even passport and even though I haven’t done anything to trigger the suspension, I am left with my hands tied, and there isn’t a single person on their side who actually can help. I tried emailing <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, but I doubt I will get any response. I am planning on fining a claim through the UK General Attorney as well as the EU Data Protection Supervisor, to try and appeal through different channels. Has anyone else had this happen before? Should I expect any positive outcome or should I just admit defeat? If anyone has any contact at Meta, I will appreciate any help.","output":"I\'m sorry to hear about your experience with being permanently banned from Meta\'s platforms. Being banned without a valid reason can be frustrating, especially if it affects your work as a Paid Media Manager. Here are a few steps you can take in this situation: 1. Keep trying to contact Meta\'s support: Continue reaching out to Meta\'s support through the help center or any other available channels. Persist in explaining your situation and asking for a review of your case. It can sometimes take multiple attempts to get a response or resolution. 2. Document your interactions: Keep a record of all your communications with Meta, including emails, support case numbers, and any other relevant information. This documentation can be useful if you need to escalate your case. 3. Seek assistance from professional communities: Reach out to professional communities, forums, or groups where other Paid Media Managers or marketers discuss similar issues. They may have encountered similar problems and could provide advice or insights on how to resolve the situation. 4. Consider legal options: If you believe your ban is unjustified and that your rights have been violated, you can explore legal options. Filing a claim with the UK General Attorney or the EU Data Protection Supervisor might be a path to pursue, especially if there are concerns related to data protection. Consult with legal professionals who specialize in data protection and technology law to understand the potential outcomes and procedures. 5. Explore alternative advertising platforms: While you continue to pursue a resolution with Meta, consider exploring alternative advertising platforms where you can still manage campaigns for your clients. Diversifying your advertising channels can reduce dependency on a single platform like Meta. Remember that each situation is unique, and outcomes can vary. It\'s crucial to remain persistent and explore all available options. Keeping a professional and calm approach throughout your interactions with Meta\'s support can also help in conveying your situation effectively."},{"instruction":"I have a question regards a new business that I want to start.

This approach allows you to demonstrate responsible advertising practices and mitigate any potential risks associated with sudden large-scale campaigns. 7. Seek support from industry experts: Engage with industry professionals, join relevant communities, and attend conferences or webinars to network with experts who have faced similar challenges. They can provide insights, advice, and strategies to help you navigate any obstacles you encounter along the way.

Травма или обида в прошлом: Если ребенок испытал негативные события, такие как издевательства, домашнее насилие или пренебрежение, он может воспринимать мир как опасное и неприветливое место. Это может привести к развитию мстительности как защитного механизма. 2. Невозможность эффективно выражать свои эмоции: Некоторые дети могут испытывать трудности в выражении и управлении своими эмоциями, что может приводить к накоплению обид и злости внутри. Мстительность может стать способом для них показать свое сопротивление и победить других. 3. Неадекватное воспитание: Воспитание, основанное на установке насилия или неприветливости, может создать условия для развития мстительности у ребенка. Если он видит, что взрослые решают конфликты с помощью агрессии и мести, он может принять такой подход как норму и повторять его в будущем. 4. Низкая самооценка: Дети с низкой самооценкой часто испытывают сомнения в себе и опасаются быть уязвимыми. Мстительность может помочь им почувствовать себя более сильными и уверенными, поскольку они могут контролировать ситуацию и отплатить за какое-либо оскорбление или обиду. В целом, мстительность у детей может быть результатом совокупности различных факторов, таких как травмы, низкая самооценка и недостаточные навыки управления эмоциями. Важно помнить, что каждый конкретный случай может иметь свои уникальные обстоятельства, и потому невозможно дать однозначный ответ на вопрос об обусловленности мстительности с детства для каждого отдельного ребенка."},{"instruction":"это может быть частью характера?","output":"Да, мстительность может быть частью характера у некоторых людей. Характер формируется под влиянием генетических, психологических и социокультурных факторов. Некоторые люди могут иметь склонность к мстительности из-за их индивидуальных черт характера, таких как высокая чувствительность, зависимость от признания или тенденция к негативному мышлению. Возможно, такие люди обижаются или чувствуют боль и обиду более интенсивно, что может привести к развитию мстительного поведения. Они могут испытывать потребность в мести как способе уравнять счета или компенсировать свои эмоциональные раны. Однако важно отметить, что характер может быть изменен и развит в результате самоанализа, работы над собой, терапии или других форм личностного роста.

At such an extremely high temperature, water would undergo a phase transition and transform into a gas (water vapor) instead. Under normal conditions, water boils and turns into vapor at 100 degrees Celsius. However, at 5000 degrees Celsius, the heat energy would cause the water molecules to move so rapidly that they would break apart from each other, resulting in the water vaporizing into a gaseous state. This is far beyond the boiling point of water and is well into the range where many materials would simply melt or vaporize. It\'s essential to note that temperatures as high as 5000 degrees Celsius are extremely rare in nature and typically only reached under specific industrial or experimental conditions, such as in high-temperature processes or extreme energy releases."},{"instruction":"Overcompressed 1200 Celsius liquid water.","output":"Liquid water can exist at temperatures above its normal boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius if it is subjected to high pressure. This is known as superheated water, and it occurs when the water is heated under intense confinement. At approximately 1200 degrees Celsius, water would need to be under very high pressure to remain in a liquid state. The exact pressure required depends on various factors such as the purity of the water and the specific conditions. However, it is important to note that at such extreme temperatures and pressures, the physical properties of water can significantly deviate from those observed under normal conditions. Under these conditions, superheated water can have unique properties, such as a reduced density and increased reactivity. It is essential to handle superheated water with caution, as it can be highly pressurized and may undergo explosive phase transitions if suddenly released from its high-pressure environment. Overall, superheated water at 1200 degrees Celsius is an extremely specialized and challenging condition to achieve.

Here\'s an example: ```python from django.urls import re_path from yourapp.consumers import YourConsumer websocket_urlpatterns = [ # Your other URL patterns re_path(r\'^ws/your-path/\', YourConsumer.as_asgi()), re_path(r\'^ws/.*\', YourConsumer.as_asgi()), # Catch-all pattern ] ``` In the above code: - `re_path(r\'^ws/.*\', YourConsumer.as_asgi())` is a regular expression URL pattern that matches any WebSocket URL starting with `/ws/`, followed by any characters (except for \\"/\\"). - `YourConsumer.as_asgi()` is the consumer that handles this catch-all pattern, where `YourConsumer` is your actual WebSocket consumer class. Make sure to place this catch-all pattern at the end of the `websocket_urlpatterns` list so that other specific patterns are checked first."},{"instruction":"how do I get url from javascript and throw itback to django then","output":"To get the URL from JavaScript and send it back to Django, you can use JavaScript\'s `location` object to access the current URL and send it to Django using an AJAX request. Here\'s an example of how you can achieve this: JavaScript (using jQuery for the AJAX request): ```javascript var currentUrl = window.location.href; .ajax({ type: \\"POST\\", url: \\"/your-django-endpoint/\\", data: { url: currentUrl }, success: function(response) { // Handle the Django response here }, error: function(xhr, status, error) { // Handle errors here } }); ``` Django (views.py): ```python from django.http import JsonResponse def your_endpoint(request): if request.method == \\"POST\\": url = request.POST.get(\\"url\\") # Get the posted URL # Process the URL in Django as required # ... return JsonResponse({\\"success\\": True}) # Return a JSON response return JsonResponse({\\"success\\": False, \\"error\\": \\"Invalid request method\\"}) ``` Here\'s how it works: - JavaScript: `window.location.href` gives you the current URL. You can send it to the Django endpoint using an AJAX POST request. Replace `/your-django-endpoint/` with the actual URL where the Django view is located. - Django: In the Django view, retrieve the URL sent by JavaScript using `request.POST.get(\\"url\\")`. Process the URL as required, and return a JSON response indicating success or failure. Remember to configure the URL pattern in Django\'s `urls.py` to map to the view."},{"instruction":"back to routing for websocket django, how do I transfer from routing to consumer no matter what","output":"To route WebSocket connections to a consumer regardless of the URL, you can define a catch-all URL pattern in Django\'s `urls.py` file, and then handle the connections in the consumer attached to that URL pattern. Here\'s an example: In `yourapp/routing.py`: ```python from django.urls import re_path from . import consumers websocket_urlpatterns = [ re_path(r\'^ws/.*\', consumers.YourConsumer.as_asgi()), ] ``` In `yourproject/asgi.py`: ```python import os from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application from django.urls import path from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter from yourapp.routing import websocket_urlpatterns os.environ.setdefault(\'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\', \'yourproject.settings\') application = ProtocolTypeRouter({ \'http\': get_asgi_application(), \'websocket\': URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns), }) ``` In `yourapp/consumers.py`: ```python from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer class YourConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer): async def connect(self): await self.accept() async def receive(self, text_data): # Handle received messages here async def disconnect(self, close_code): # Clean up or handle disconnect here ``` With the above setup: - The `websocket_urlpatterns` list in `yourapp/routing.py` contains a catch-all URL pattern (`re_path(r\'^ws/.*\', consumers.YourConsumer.as_asgi())`) that matches any WebSocket URL starting with `/ws/`. - In `yourproject/asgi.py`, the `websocket` protocol is routed to the `URLRouter` with the `websocket_urlpatterns` list. - The `YourConsumer` class in `yourapp/consumers.py` handles the WebSocket connections. You can implement the required logic for handling received messages, disconnects, etc. within this consumer class. By setting up the catch-all URL pattern in the routing and directing it to the desired consumer, any WebSocket connection made with any URL starting with `/ws/` will be handled by the `YourConsumer`."},{"instruction":"imediately send message in websocket without waiting for user input","output":"To immediately send a message in a Django WebSocket without waiting for user input, you can override the `connect` method of the WebSocket consumer and send a message as soon as the connection is established. Here\'s an example: ```python from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer class YourConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer): async def connect(self): await self.accept() message = \\"Hello from the server!\\" # Your message await self.send(text_data=message) # Send the message async def receive(self, text_data): # Handle received messages here async def disconnect(self, close_code): # Clean up or handle disconnect here ``` In the above code, the `YourConsumer` class inherits from `AsyncWebsocketConsumer`. The `connect` method is overridden to send an immediate message after the connection is accepted using `await self.send(text_data=message)`. Replace `\\"Hello from the server!\\"` with your own message or the data you want to send immediately. When the WebSocket connection is established and the consumer\'s `connect` method is called, the specified message will be sent to the client without waiting for any user input."},{"instruction":"beside connect. disconnect. recieve, is there any other method that always get trigger in django websocket","output":"In Django Channels WebSocket, besides the `connect`, `disconnect`, and `receive` methods, there is another method called `send` which can be used to send messages from the server to the client. However, the `send` method needs to be explicitly called by your code. Here\'s an example of using the `send` method in a Django WebSocket consumer: ```python from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer class YourConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer): async def connect(self): await self.accept() async def receive(self, text_data): # Handle received messages here # ... # Send a message to the client message = \\"Hello from the server!\\" await self.send(text_data=message) async def disconnect(self, close_code): # Clean up or handle disconnect here ``` In the example above, the `receive` method is overridden to handle incoming messages from the client. After processing the received message, you can use `await self.send()` to send a message back to the client. Remember, the `send` method needs to be called explicitly within your code whenever you want to send a message from the server to the connected client."},{"instruction":"how do consumer, in websocket know what button is clicked","output":"In a WebSocket consumer, you can\'t directly know which button is clicked on the client-side because WebSocket is a low-level communication protocol that doesn\'t have built-in support for tracking button clicks or form submissions. However, you can achieve this by having the client-side code send an appropriate message to the WebSocket server when a button is clicked, and then handle that message in the consumer. Here\'s an example: Client-side JavaScript (using WebSocket API): ```javascript // Assume you have a WebSocket connection named \\"websocket\\" // Handle button click document.getElementById(\'your-button-id\').addEventListener(\'click\', function() { websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ \\"button\\": \\"your-button-id\\" })); }); ``` Django consumer: ```python from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer class YourConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer): async def connect(self): await self.accept() async def receive(self, text_data): # Handle received messages here data = json.loads(text_data) if \'button\' in data: button_id = data[\'button\'] if button_id == \'your-button-id\': # Button with the specified ID was clicked # Handle logic for that button here else: # Handle other messages as needed pass async def disconnect(self, close_code): # Clean up or handle disconnect here ``` In the client-side JavaScript code, when a button with ID \\"your-button-id\\" is clicked, it sends a WebSocket message to the server containing the ID of the clicked button. In the Django consumer\'s `receive` method, you can parse the received message (assuming it\'s a JSON string) and check if it contains a \\"button\\" key. If the key is present and matches the expected button ID, you can perform the desired logic for that button. Remember to replace \'your-button-id\' with the actual ID of the button you want to track in your HTML and JavaScript code."},{"instruction":"dos stringify keep object state","output":"The `JSON.stringify()` function converts a JavaScript object to a JSON string representation. However, the resulting JSON string does not retain the object\'s internal state or behavior. It only includes the object\'s properties and their values. When you convert an object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`, the resulting string is independent of the original object. It does not preserve methods, prototype chains, or any other non-serializable aspects of the object. Here\'s an example to illustrate this: ```javascript const obj = { name: \\"John\\", age: 30, greet: function() { console.log(`Hello, I\'m {this.name}`); } }; const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj); console.log(jsonString); ``` In the above code, if you stringify the `obj` using `JSON.stringify()`, the resulting `jsonString` will only contain the properties `name` and `age`, but not the `greet` method. Output: ``` {\\"name\\":\\"John\\",\\"age\\":30} ``` So, if you need to preserve the entire state and behavior of an object, including methods and other non-serializable aspects, you may need to look into alternative approaches like utilizing class instances or custom serialization/unserialization methods."}]'),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],j={key:0},H={key:1};function q(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
