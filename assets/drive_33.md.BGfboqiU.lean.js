Unloved and neglected by her late parents, who had just been killed in an earthquake, she is a cold, unpleasant girl, unhappy in her new surroundings. Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house. In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunt's garden, which was locked and neglected since her accidental death ten years prior. Martha Sowerby, a maid, and her brother, Dickon, a nature-loving boy who can \\"talk\\" to animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the \\"secret garden,\\" Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually losing her sour persona and becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process. When finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing he was responsible for locking up the secret garden. Fearful he would do it again, Mary evasively asks to plant seeds in an \\"unwanted\\" part of the Manor, to which Lord Craven grants permission before leaving the country for the rest of the year. Confident that the garden will remain a secret, Mary and Dickon continue their work. Hidden away in the gloomy mansion is Mary's cousin, Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid.

Solve 1976 + 1676 = -166*j for j.","output":"Alright, let's first add the numbers on the left side of the equation, which are 1976 and 1676. 1976 + 1676 = 3652 Now, our equation looks like this: 3652 = -166*j To find the value of 'j', we need to make 'j' alone on one side of the equation. Right now, 'j' is being multiplied by -166. So, we need to do the opposite operation, which is dividing, to get rid of the -166. Let's divide both sides of the equation by -166. 3652 ÷ -166 = (-166 * j) ÷ -166 This simplifies the equation to: -22 = j So the solution to the math problem is j = -22.

All such possibilities, however, raise the concern that the clone would be treated as less than a complete individual, because he or she would likely suffer from limitations and expectations based on the family's knowledge of the genetic \\"twin.\\" Those expectations might be false, because human personality is only partly determined by genes. The clone of an extrovert  could have a quite different way of behavior. Clones of athletes, movie stars, or scientists might well choose different careers because of chance events in early life.        Some people have also put forward the belief that couples in which one member is infertile  might choose to make a copy of one or the other partner. But society ought to be concerned that a couple might not treat naturally a child who is a copy of just one of them. Because other methods are available for the treatment of all known types of infertility, the traditional choice seems more appropriate. None of the suggested uses of cloning for making copies of existing people is ethically acceptable to my way of thinking, because they are not in the interests of the resulting child. It should go without saying that I am strongly opposed to allowing cloned human embryos  to develop so that they can be tissue donors.

However, unless your teacher requires it, don’t feel like you have to memorize the entire speech verbatim. Reciting a completely memorized speech can feel stiff, so just commit the content to memory well enough that you can explain your ideas clearly and consistently.  While it’s generally okay to use slightly different phrasing, try to stick to your complete outline as best you can. If you veer off too much or insert too many additional words, you could end up exceeding your time limit. Keep in mind your speaking outline will help you stay focused. As for quotes and statistics, feel free to write them on your notecards for quick reference. Use hand gestures to emphasize key words and ideas, and make natural eye contact to engage the audience. Be sure to switch your gaze every 5 or 10 seconds instead of staring blankly in a single direction. Instead of slouching, stand up tall with your shoulders back. In addition to projecting confidence, good posture will help you breathe deeply to support your voice. Once you’ve committed the speech to memory, work on making your delivery as engaging as possible. Watch yourself in a mirror or record yourself to make sure you appear confident and natural. Get a second opinion and ask a friend or relative to watch you and offer feedback. Have them point out any spots that dragged or seemed disorganized. Ask if your tone was engaging, if you used body language effectively, and if your volume, pitch, and pacing need any tweaks. Use a stopwatch or cell phone app to time yourself when you practice your speech. Speak clearly and avoid rushing, but work on keeping your speech under the time limit, if your instructor set one.  If you keep exceeding the time limit, review your complete sentence outline. Cut any fluff and simplify complicated phrases. If your speech isn’t long enough, look for areas that could use more detail or consider adding another section to the body. Just make sure any content you add is relevant.

During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.

Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.  Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\"  However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general: Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\".  While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis \\"has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God.\\"  In 2014 Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists. Former guitarist Nick Hipa calls these claims slanderous and defamatory.

Putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, it is not necessarily true that \\"Pain is identical to C-fibre firing.\\" Pain, according to Putnam's papers, may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, and yet they all experience the same mental state of \\"being in pain\\".  Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an \\"ambitious\\" and \\"highly implausible\\" conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as the \\"likelihood argument\\".  Putnam formulated a complementary argument based on what he called \\"functional isomorphism\\". He defined the concept in these terms: \\"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'.\\" In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as an \\"a priori argument\\".  Jerry Fodor, Putnam, and others noted that, along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level. Answer this question \\"What did he discover through this?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Through his work on the hypothesis of multiple realizability, Putnam discovered that mental states, such as pain, may correspond to different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, yet they all experience the same mental state.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed.

When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him.

Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\".  - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\").  - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.  - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either .

Movie title: Friday Night Lights Context: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed...

Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.  and a hint : Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.

When you are doing lymphatic massage, you want to make sure that you don’t press too hard. The lymphatic vessels are located right under the skin, so if you press too hard, you are going to go deeper than the vessels. Press down enough so that your fingers are not sliding over your skin, but make sure that you can’t feel anything beneath the skin. You may feel like this is too light, especially if you are used to deeper tissue massages. You may be used to giving or receiving massages where you glide along the skin. A lymphatic massage needs to stimulate the lymphatic vessels, which are elastic and attached to the skin. You need to lightly stretch your skin to massage them. The direction of your stretch of the skin is important. You should stretch the skin in the direction that the lymph flows naturally. You want to help stimulate the natural flow. If you stretch the skin the wrong way, you are doing nothing. The lymph flow goes towards your trunk and heart. Make sure to take your fingers off the skin after each stretch. If you move your fingers back and forth, you are just moving the lymph and not helping to drain it. As you massage the lymph vessels, you should go slow. The normal rhythm of their flow is slow, so try to take around three seconds to perform each stretch of the skin. Release and wait for a few seconds before beginning again.

To make a wooden table water resistant for a short time,","output":"To make a wooden table water-resistant for a short time, follow these steps: Step 1: Clean the table Begin by cleaning the wooden table thoroughly. Remove any debris, dust, and dirt using a damp cloth or sponge. Make sure the table is completely dry before proceeding to the next step. This ensures that the protective coating will adhere properly to the surface. Step 2: Lightly sand the surface Using fine-grit sandpaper (around 220 grit), lightly sand the entire surface of the table, including the edges and legs. This will help to remove any existing finish and create a slightly rough surface for the new water-resistant coating to bond to. Be sure to sand with the grain of the wood and wipe away any dust with a clean cloth. Step 3: Choose a water-resistant sealant Select an appropriate water-resistant sealant or finish for your wooden table. You have multiple options, such as water-resistant varnish, polyurethane, or a specialized sealant designed for wooden furniture. Ensure the product you choose is specifically designed for temporary protection and is suitable for the type of wood that your table is made from. Step 4: Apply the sealant Before applying the sealant, stir it well and use a good-quality brush or foam applicator. Apply the sealant or finish evenly to the entire surface of the table, paying special attention to any grooves, edges, or intricate designs. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in terms of drying and curing time before applying additional coats, usually 1-2 hours between coats. For short-term water resistance, two to three coats should suffice. Step 5: Let it dry Allow the final coat of the sealant to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. This is usually 24 hours. It is essential to let it dry fully to guarantee effective water resistance. Step 6: Buff the surface Use a soft cloth or ultra-fine steel wool (0000 grade) to gently buff the surface of the table, removing any possible brush marks or imperfections left by the sealant. This step will give the table a smooth and professional-looking finish. Step 7: Maintain the table To ensure your table remains water-resistant for a short period, avoid leaving water or wet objects on its surface for extended durations. If water does make contact with the surface, wipe it off immediately with a dry cloth to minimize the potential for damage. Note that this method will provide temporary water resistance, and the table may need to be resealed in the future if prolonged exposure to moisture occurs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have this equation: 94*u + 65 - 131 + 66 = 0 1. Let's add and subtract the numbers: (65 - 131 + 66) = 0. So, we have -66 + 66 = 0. 2. The equation now looks like this: 94*u + 0 = 0 3. Since adding 0 doesn't change anything, we can simplify it to: 94*u = 0 4. To find the value of 'u', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 94. Like this: u = 0 / 94 5.

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was far from welcoming. The décor was outdated, and it seemed like the restaurant hadn't been updated since the 90's. There was a musty odor that persisted throughout the evening, which was off-putting and made it difficult to fully enjoy my meal. The service was another disappointment. For a place that is supposed to be high-end, the staff was inattentive and slow. Our waiter took an exceptionally long time to take our drink and food orders and barely checked on us throughout the meal. We had to flag him down just to get our drinks refilled, and it took almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we had finished eating. As for the food, it was mediocre at best. I ordered the filet mignon, which was overcooked and considerably smaller than I would have expected for the price. The vegetables that accompanied the dish were bland and wilted, as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. My companion ordered the seared tuna, but it had an unpleasant fishy taste, suggesting that it was not the freshest. To top it all off, the prices were astronomical for the quality of food and service we received. I understand that high-end restaurants come with a higher price tag, but I expect that to be reflected in the quality of the food and overall experience, which it simply wasn't on this occasion. Overall, I cannot recommend The Elegant Platter to anyone looking for a fine dining experience.

Fact 2: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are the seasons of the year.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What being tilted on its rotating axis causes spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\\" with the following options:  - the Sun  - Earth  - climate  - wind  - mild  - the Moon  - orbital plane  - growth The answer is:","output":"Earth The Earth being tilted on its rotating axis is responsible for causing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that runs through the planet from the North Pole to the South Pole. This line is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt plays a significant role in the way sunlight reaches the Earth's surface and, subsequently, gives rise to the seasons. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the angle at which sunlight reaches the planet varies throughout the year. This changing angle results in different amounts of sunlight being distributed across the globe, leading to the distinct seasons. The tilt ensures that during certain times of the year, the Northern Hemisphere will receive more direct sunlight, causing summer, while the Southern Hemisphere receives less light, experiencing winter. Half a year later, the situation is reversed, with the Southern Hemisphere experiencing summer and the Northern Hemisphere facing winter. When the Earth's tilt is positioned in such a way that neither hemisphere is tilted towards or away from the Sun, we observe the transitional seasons of spring and autumn. Each hemisphere will experience these seasons when the Earth's tilt is not directing them towards or away from the Sun, resulting in mild temperatures and moderate sunlight levels. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What being tilted on its rotating axis causes spring, summer, autumn, and winter?\\" is the Earth. The tilt of the Earth on its axis leads to the variation in sunlight distribution, which, in turn, gives rise to the different seasons throughout the year. The other options, such as the Sun, climate, wind, mild, the Moon, orbital plane, and growth, do not directly cause the seasons. While some of these options may play a role in seasonal characteristics (e.g., the Sun providing light and heat, and climate patterns influencing seasonal weather), it is the Earth's tilted axis that ultimately determines the occurrence and characteristics of the various seasons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The attackers also spray-painted 'we found you ****' on a wall at the woman's home and tried to set it on fire. Police in Lincoln, Nebraska refused to elaborate on what had been carved into the 33-year-old woman's body with a knife in the horrific attack on Saturday night. Terror: The homophobic slur was spray-painted on the wall of the woman's basement at her home after she was bound and her body cut. United against hate: Residents of Lincoln, Nebraska hold a vigil after a 33-year-old woman had homophobic slurs carved into her body by three masked attackers. The distraught woman, who is openly lesbian, managed to walk to a neighbor's house following the assault when the attackers had left. Linda Rappl, 68, said the woman was naked and bleeding. She told CNN: 'She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.' Mrs Rappl called police and the woman was treated at hospital after she was cut on the stomach and arms. She was being housed at an emergency shelter and had asked that her identity not be released. The local community banded together in a vigil organized by a local LGBT group on Sunday night. More than 500 people attended to show their outrage at the attack and support for the victim. Mayor Chris Beutler said authorities would do everything to ensure justice is done and denounced violence directed at any group. Hate crime: The attack happened on Saturday night in Lincoln, Nebraska. Katie Flood, a spokeswoman for the Lincoln Police Department, said that 'multiple detectives' are working on the case, but the department does not want to release many details this early in the investigation. 'Doing so could compromise our ability to conduct quality suspect interviews at a later date,' she said. Nothing was reported stolen from the home. The hate crime comes in the wake of public debate over the city's fairness amendment, a proposal to ban discrimination in housing and employment based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The city council approved the measure in May but opponents obtained enough signatures to keep it from going into effect before an as-yet unscheduled public vote. 'It was the talk of the town,' said Tyler Richard, president of Outlinc, a Lincoln gay rights support group. He said public comments to the council about the ordinance have run in favor of keeping it. Omaha, Nebraska's largest city, approved anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender residents in March. Richard, who attended Sunday's vigil, said Outlinc has 'full faith' in the Lincoln Police Department, which he said has a long history of support for the city's gay and lesbian community. 'We trust that their investigation will be fair and complete and we await the results,' Richard said in a statement.

Ivory turns well. Available options: [i] different meanings [ii] the same meaning","output":"[i] different meanings In the given sentences, the word \\"turn\\" is used with different meanings. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the nuances in their meanings. 1. In Vermont, the leaves turn early. In this sentence, \\"turn\\" refers to the process of changing colors during the autumn season. Leaves on deciduous trees typically change from green to shades of yellow, orange, and red before falling off the tree. This process takes place when the weather starts getting colder in autumn. Therefore, \\"turn\\" in this context means the transformation or change in appearance of the leaves. 2. Ivory turns well. In the second sentence, \\"turn\\" has a different meaning. Here, \\"turn\\" is related to the process of shaping materials, in this case, ivory, using a lathe. A lathe is a machine that holds and rotates the material on its axis against a cutting tool to shape it. When it's mentioned that \\"ivory turns well,\\" it means that ivory is a material that can be easily and effectively shaped or worked on by using a lathe. In conclusion, the word \\"turn\\" has different meanings in these two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the changing colors of leaves in autumn, while in the second, it refers to the shaping of a material (ivory) on a lathe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Nobody wants to be called a helicopter parent,who manages to be responsible for whatever a child does, however small a matter is--but parents want to protect their kids.At least no playing with sticks means no risk of lost eyes. Yet as Gever Tulley points out in Fifty Dangerous Things(You Should Let Your Children Do),children who grow up as safe as possible become adults who aren't adventurous,highly adaptable,or confident.Sometimes you have to fall out of a tree to figure out how to climb one the right way,and learning that you can accomplish such a thing on your own teaches you that you can be self--sufficient. With Fifty Dangerous Things,Gever Tulley,has written a handbook of activities that are,yes,dangerous at some level-like playing with fire,breaking glass,and opening batteries.The book is a blueprint to help parents and children explore the world,and ensure the children grow up,with a little common sense and a lot of curiosity. Both the advice and the warnings are down to earth.Yes,there are risks,but Tulley provides good ways to learn to avoid them through your own skill.It takes work to raise a child who can use a table saw or build a campfire.But with this book in hand,it'll be a satisfying adventure.     We see a child climbing a tree and the first thing we think of is how they might fall and be disabled for life.We seldom say,\\"Look at how well Sarah is climbing that tree!\\" When we protect children from every possible source of danger,we also prevent them from having the kinds of experiences that develop their sense of self--reliance,their ability to deal with risks,and their sense of accomplishment.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country...., can you guess it ?

She was the most important influence in my life.","output":"The word \\"influence\\" is used in both sentences. However, it is not used in exactly the same way in both contexts. The main reasons for that differentiation lie in the nuances of meaning and in its linguistic function within each sentence. 1. \\"Used her parents' influence to get the job\\": In this context, the word \\"influence\\" is used as a noun and signifies the power that somebody's parents hold to affect circumstances or events. In other words, the parents' influence refers to their ability to sway decisions, possibly because of their reputation, status, connection, or credibility. Their influence is put to use, in this context, to secure a job, potentially indicating a situation where they were able to persuade or convince the job provider to hire their daughter.  Here, the connotations of influence suggest more tangible impacts, involving external manipulation of situations to reach a desired result. Herein, \\"influence\\" leans towards an action regarding persuasion and control. 2. \\"She was the most important influence in my life\\": In contrast, in this case, the term \\"influence\\" also signifies some sort of power or effect, but it's more about the effect that a person (in this case, she) has had on the speaker's life. This influence could be through teaching, inspiration, guidance, or simply by setting an example that the speaker chooses to follow. Here, \\"influence\\" is used with more emotional and personal connotations. It points to a more intangible and less directly controllable impact on another person's thoughts, decisions, or life directions.  To summarize, while \\"influence\\" in both sentences carries a sense of affecting something or someone, the first sentence emphasizes more concrete, perhaps immediate or transactional, influence, like using connections or authority. The second sentence, however, portrays a deeper, more personal and life-altering kind of influence, relating more to personality, behaviors, and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting.

Andrew Levy. Two teenagers’ bodies were recovered yesterday after they drowned in separate incidents while cooling off in dangerous waters during the heatwave. The tragedies followed another death on Tuesday, when a 13-year-old boy went into a fast-flowing section of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to retrieve a football. A high of 28.6C (83.5F) was recorded in the Solent in Hampshire yesterday, with other parts of the country seeing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers. [caption. The sweltering heat, which is due to continue today, coincided with the start of the school holidays – prompting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to issue a warning to young people. Leisure safety manager Dave Walker said: ‘Even on a hot day, the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting, and there may be underwater debris that you cannot see.’ Rony John, 15, was found dead at 2am yesterday, ten hours after he got into trouble while swimming in the Great Ouse river near Hartford in Cambridgeshire. Search teams then discovered the body of Conor McColl, 16, from Luton, just after 1pm. Conor also disappeared on Thursday, at around 6pm, after swimming in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire. Two other teenagers were rescued from the water. Weak swimmer Rony had jumped into the river with fellow pupils from St Peter’s School, Huntingdon. Rony John, 15, went missing in the River Great Ouse near Church Lane in Hartford, Cambridgeshire. One girl at the scene said: ‘Apparently he couldn’t swim and he went in with a group of boys. ‘They all held on to him so that he wouldn’t go under and then he said that he could swim.’ The two tragedies today come just. days after Arran Cooper, ten and Kyrece Francis, 13, died in separate. tragedies earlier this week. Schoolboy. Arran, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the. early hours of Wednesday after he fell into the River Orchy, in the. Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. His. death came less than 24 hours after 13-year-old Kyrece Francis drowned. in the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently jumping. in the fast-flowing water to retrieve a football. Arran Cooper (left), tem, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died after he fell into the River Orchy, in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute. Kyrece Francis (right) was remembered by friends as a promising footballer and a 'genuine' and 'great' guy. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution also urged the public to take care in the sea, after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother had to be rescued on Wednesday. The pair were nearly swept into the path of a shipping lane by currents in Ramsgate, Kent. Thousands are being tempted to the coast as ocean temperatures have hit a seven-year high in some places. The water has reached 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon – a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles. Elsewhere, a mother who abandoned her baby in a boiling car to go shopping was cautioned by police. Passers-by called the emergency services after noticing the child had been left alone in the Surrey supermarket car park on Tuesday, when temperatures hit 20C (68F) in the shade, The Sun reported. Police gave the mother a caution for ‘wilful abandonment’. The baby did not require medical treatment. Forecasters said the high temperatures would continue today – making Britain hotter than Crete – before falling by up to four degrees on Sunday. Sun-worshippers who end up looking more like a lobster than a bronzed beauty can now get relief – using the first burn lotion containing ibuprofen. The cream, called Soleve, delivers the painkiller directly to burnt skin. In trials it was found to remove the stinging sensation for eight out of ten users. The lotion, which costs £9.95 for 100ml, also contains the emollient isopropyl myristate, which soothes and moisturises the skin and traps in water, helping the body’s healing process. Surveys show three out of five Britons have suffered from sunburn in the past five years, and say it has blighted their holidays. Other after-sun lotions currently available are simply forms of moisturisers and can do nothing to relieve the pain of mild to moderate sunburn. Dr Phil Rosher of Diomed Developments, which created Soleve, said trials showed it helped to relieve pain, swelling, inflammation and tenderness.","output":"- Two teenagers drowned in separate incidents in dangerous waters during the heatwave, with another death occurring on Tuesday. - High temperatures reached 28.6C (83.5F) in the Solent in Hampshire, with other parts of the country experiencing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers. - The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents issued a warning to young people, stating that even on a hot day, the water might be colder or deeper than expected and there may be underwater debris. - The Royal National Lifeboat Institution urged the public to exercise caution in the sea after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother were rescued in Ramsgate, Kent. - Ocean temperatures hit a seven-year high in some areas, reaching 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon, making the water a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: In this method, you'll use water, glow sticks, and several other common ingredients to make water that doesn't need a black light to glow. As in the methods above, start by filling a clear container, like a bottle or jar, with water. You'll also need a few other things before you get started:  One or more glow sticks Scissors Dish soap Hydrogen peroxide Waterproof gloves Take each glowstick, find the glass vial within, and bend the stick until you feel a \\"crack.\\" The tube should immediately begin to glow — this will be easiest to see if the lights are off. Repeat this for each glow stick. The more glow sticks you use, the brighter your water will be.  Glow sticks are available at party stores and many department stores (especially around Halloween.) They are generally very cheap — a 100-pack can cost as little as 12.  Try to find the largest glowsticks available, so that your water can offer the most luminescence as possible. Put your gloves on. Using your scissors, carefully cut off the tip of each glow stick and pour the glowing liquid within into the water. Mix the water and the glowing liquid. Be careful — remember that each glow stick contains broken glass. ) Your water should now be glowing, but with a few extra ingredients, you can make it even better. Measure out a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide and pour them into the mixture, then squirt in about a half-teaspoon of ordinary dish soap (e.g., Palmolive, Ajax, etc.) The two chemicals in a glow stick are diphenyl oxalate (in the plastic tube) and hydrogen peroxide (in the inner glass vial.) When you crack the tube, the glass vial breaks and the two chemicals mix, producing light. Adding extra hydrogen peroxide is the same as adding more of the chemical in the glass vial, which makes the reaction brighter. Dish soap contains chemicals that reduce the surface tension of the water, making it easier for the hydrogen peroxide and the diphenyl oxalate to mix. When you're finished, seal your container and shake it (or just stir it) to make sure that all the ingredients have mixed. When you're done, your water will glow with or without a black light (though a black light can enhance the effect.) This mixture is not safe to drink.","output":"The glow-in-the-dark water method involves using water, glow sticks, and other easily accessible ingredients to create water that can glow without the need for a black light. To create this glowing water, the following materials are required: a clear container (like a bottle or jar) filled with water, one or more glow sticks, scissors, dish soap, hydrogen peroxide, and waterproof gloves. To begin, activate each glow stick by finding the glass vial inside and bending the stick until it cracks. The glow sticks will start to glow, and the more glow sticks used, the brighter the resulting water will be. Glow sticks can be found at party or department stores, and the largest size is recommended for maximum luminescence. Next, while wearing gloves, carefully cut open each glow stick and pour the glowing liquid into the water. Be cautious of the broken glass inside the glow sticks. Mixing the water and the glowing liquid should result in glowing water. To enhance this effect, add a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide and about half a teaspoon of dish soap. The hydrogen peroxide intensifies the reaction that produces light, while the dish soap allows the chemicals to mix more easily by reducing the water's surface tension. After adding these extra ingredients, seal the container and shake or stir it to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting glowing water can be observed without a black light, although a black light may enhance the effect.

Within the services sector, the financial services industry, particularly in banking and insurance, has been a dominant force and major contributor to the UK's economy. The UK's financial services industry is a global powerhouse and continues to flourish, with London being a major center for international business and considered an essential hub in the world's financial network. This success is due to various factors, including a thriving capital market, an established regulatory framework, cutting-edge technological infrastructure, and a highly skilled workforce. According to the latest available data, the financial services sector contributes around 6.9% of the UK's total Gross Value Added (GVA) while employing approximately 1.1 million people. In addition, exports of financial services account for around 10.4% of the total UK service exports, making it the largest exporter of financial services in the world. Alongside the financial services industry, the professional services industry, including legal, accounting, management consulting, and advertising services, also play a vital role in the UK's economy. These industries collectively employ around 25% of the nation's workforce and contribute significantly to the overall GVA. Moreover, digital technology and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector have experienced significant growth in recent years. The UK is a renowned digital hub and home to various tech start-ups, which have contributed to the acceleration of the nation's digital economy. Consequently, there has been a growing demand for technology-based services and various digital products. Other major components of the UK's service sector include retail, healthcare, education and hospitality. These industries, though affected by the global pandemic, have prominently contributed to the economy and provided significant employment opportunities across the UK. It is important to note that the UK services sector, along with the other sectors, experienced some challenges due to Brexit. However, the country continues to grow and adapt to the changing global landscape, so it remains a significant player on the international stage. To sum up, the largest industry in the UK today is the services sector, with a strong focus on financial services, professional services, and digital technology. While the services sector is by far the most substantial in terms of GVA and employment, other sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and agriculture also contribute significantly to the UK's diversified economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is It has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, that is a good answer to the question. Let me break down the answer and justify the steps taken to reach this conclusion. Step 1: Acknowledge the limitation of NPOs It is important to recognize that most nonprofits may not have the financial resources to compete with the private sector in terms of salaries. Step 2: Focus on alternative compensation As a solution, NPOs should consider offering competitive benefits and incentives that can make up for the difference in pay. These benefits might include health insurance, retirement plans, and professional development opportunities. Step 3: Emphasize the pleasurable work environment Since it's known that employee satisfaction and retention are highly influenced by the work environment, nonprofits should make conscious efforts to create a positive, fulfilling, and enjoyable atmosphere within their organizations. By providing these incentives and creating pleasurable work environments, NPOs can still attract and retain talented employees despite not offering the same level of wages as private-sector companies. This strategy takes into account the financial limitations of nonprofits while still allowing them to secure dedicated professionals driven by the organization's mission and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who gave  her daughter life with her own blood?  In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"A rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to\\" would be a combination of three answer choices presented: heat, sound, and waves. This is because when a rubber band snaps, it undergoes a rapid release of energy which results in vibrations in the particles of the rubber band. These vibrations cause various effects, including heat, sound, and waves. Here's a more detailed explanation of each effect: 1. Heat: The rapid release of energy when a rubber band snaps causes some of this energy to be converted into heat. This heat is generated due to the collision of the vibrating particles within the rubber band. 2. Sound: The vibrations caused by the snapping of a rubber band propagate through the air as sound waves. This is what we hear as the characteristic \\"snap\\" sound when a rubber band is broken. The sound is produced because the rapid movement and vibration of the particles push and pull the surrounding air, creating pressure waves that travel through the atmosphere and reach our ears. 3. Waves: In addition to sound waves, the rapid release of energy in a snapping rubber band also causes mechanical waves, which are essentially a transfer of energy through a medium. When the rubber band snaps, the particles of the rubber band move rapidly and generate vibrations that spread out as mechanical waves. These mechanical waves can travel through various media, such as solids, liquids, or gases. In summary, when a rubber band snaps, the particles in the rubber band vibrate and produce heat, sound, and waves as the energy transferred during the snapping process is rapidly dissipated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Now, I have a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  Answer this question please: Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland compared to conventional milk production. This is mainly because organic production potentially reduces the leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates.  In the situation you've described, the Luchene brand has a label indicating that it's an organic product, while Jean's milk does not have any such indication and is confirmed as not being organic by a store employee. Given this information, it can be concluded that the Luchene brand of milk likely has a lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland compared to Jean's milk. This is because Luchene's organic production practices would generally involve lower fertilizer application rates, thus reducing the potential for eutrophication. However, it is essential to note that differences in practices between individual farms, even within the organic sector, can influence environmental impacts. But considering the available information, Luchene's organic milk would be the better choice if Jimmy's priority is lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide a detailed explanation, let us break down the key elements in this statement. Queen Victoria, who reigned as the monarch of the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901, commissioned Sir Robert Peel, a prominent member of the Conservative Party (also known as the Tory party), to form a new government ministry. Sir Robert Peel served as the British Prime Minister twice, first from 1834 to 1835 and then from 1841 to 1846. In the United Kingdom, when the existing government loses the confidence of the majority in the House of Commons, either due to an election or other reasons, it is customary for the monarch to invite a leader from the party with the majority in the House to form a new government. In this case, Queen Victoria commissioned Sir Robert Peel, a notable Tory politician and statesman, to undertake this task and create a new ministry. Peel's tenure as Prime Minister saw several significant policy changes and reforms, including the establishment of the modern British police force, the reduction of import tariffs on foreign goods (a move for free trade), and the repeal of the Corn Laws, which caused a split in the Conservative Party but was intended to improve the country's economic situation.

Q: How often does Montana voted for a Democratic president?  A: Overall, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time and Democratic presidents 40 percent of the time, with these numbers being 40/60 for Republican candidates.  Does the answer correctly answer the question pick from the following.  -- yes  -- no","output":"A: Looking into the historical voting patterns of Montana for the Presidential elections, the state predominantly leans towards the Republican Party. Montana has been part of the United States since it got the statehood on November 8, 1889. The state has participated in 33 presidential elections since then. In the 20th century, Montana voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in nine out of 25 elections. This includes the four consecutive terms won by Franklin D. Roosevelt starting from 1932 to 1944, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Bill Clinton in 1992. However, from 1952 to 1988, Montana heavily leaned towards the Republicans, voting Democratic only once. In the 21st century so far, Montana has shown a strong leaning towards the Republican party. The state hasn't voted for a Democratic president since 1992 and has consistently voted for Republican candidates in all elections. This includes George W. Bush's two terms starting from 2000 to 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012, and Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. So while Montana has elected Democratic governors relatively frequently, the state tends to be much more conservative when it comes to Presidential elections.  It is important to note political leanings and voting patterns can change over time and are influenced by several factors, including the candidates running, their platforms, and the political climate both nationally and locally. Therefore, while historical voting patterns can provide some insights, they cannot predict with absolute certainty how a state will vote in future elections."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

When faced with a very argumentative person, it is important to remind yourself that your antagonist does not likely want to hear your opinion.  (1). Arguing will only confuse you and possibly disappoint them. Often it seems that everything just goes wrong when arguing with someone. (2). Defending yourself effectively while being involved with an argument will only make the person annoyed more; they will generally just start blowing it out of proportion. Of course, picking on yourself for being argumentative can be a common outcome, but it is easier to let it come up than putting blame out there to the other person or even yourself. (3). Nothing you say will be convincing enough to settle the argument, and an argumentative person will likely not admit it even if they are wrong.

Question: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.  Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Our Smartphones, Ourselves Nokia, or at least the color psychologist it interviewed on its Conversations by Nokia blog, has a theory about why we choose the color phones that we do. (Hat tip to IntoMobile for spotting the post). “Every time you make a color choice, you’re making a statement about what’s going on in your head, even though most of the time you don’t know it,” according to color psychologist Angela Wright, head of Color Affects. “Around 80 percent of our color choices are sub-conscious.” Briefly, according to Wright, if you gravitate to cyan blue it means you are happy, brave and feel confident in your choice. Picking white as your phone color says you are a sophisticated smartphone aficionado with high standards. Fuchsia or magenta means you are a militant feminist, a sympathizer or possibly afraid of them and would to ingratiate oneself with them. And while black would seemingly suggest the owner is sophisticated and confident, in fact it does not, Wright says. Rather, the choice indicates a need for a security blanket or of protection or camouflage. (Reader, here is where I admit my phone is black). As a counter point to the black-is-the-new-security-blanket, Nokia’s Head of Industrial Design Stefan Pannenbecker offers this alternative theory: people like it because of its “technical” feel, making it appealing to your inner nerd. Whatever. It is a fun analysis and, I am sure or at least hope, mostly tongue-in-check. Nokia’s take on the subject, aside from making sure that people know the Lumina comes in cyan blue, also highlights the more serious marketing studies that pick apart smartphones and how and why consumers choose them–and what these choices mean for marketers targeting these people. Consider Apple’s push to expand its market share in China. Samsung, by far, is the top smartphone there but Apple is showing signs of making inroads among a very specific constituency, according to a report by Guohe, called Mobile Advertising: Six Key Trends in 2012. Google‘s Android is the dominant platform, at 54% of users interviewed. In addition, 39% had jailbroken phones. However, even though iPhone users are in the minority they are well worth targeting: they are, according to the study, more affluent city dwellers, entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and fashion-conscious users. They also tend to gravitate toward game, utility, and shopping apps. Also, a greater percentage of China’s iOS users spend more money on apps than do Android users (Apple was willing early on to accept China’s RMB currency as payment, which is one reason). Meanwhile, only 23% of the study’s Android users ever purchased any apps, though they’ve likely downloaded plenty of free apps from over 100 different third party app stores for Android in China. You can find a lot of analysis like that provided by mobile marketing platform providers and other related parties, and not just for the China market. My favorite study, though, comes at the subject, like Nokia did, in a slightly different way.

Article: Hurricane Fred formed just off the western coast of Africa early on Monday morning, coming in as the second-farthest east a hurricane has ever formed in the Atlantic Ocean since records began. It’s extremely unusual to see such a strong storm so close to Africa, but here we are!      Experts widely expect this year’s Atlantic hurricane season to see below-normal activity thanks to the raging El Niño out in the Pacific Ocean, but below average or not, it’s turning into one of the most interesting Atlantic hurricane seasons in recent memory.      Tropical Storm Ana—a rare May storm—made landfall in South Carolina, nudging its way into the record books as the second-earliest U.S. landfall on record. Tropical Storm Bill remained a tropical depression for four days (!!) after landfall in Texas as it made a wide curve through the middle of the United States, finally losing tropical characteristics somewhere near Cincinnati. Claudette became a potent little tropical storm off the Mid-Atlantic coast, spinning-up from thunderstorms in North Carolina a few days earlier. Danny was an incredibly tiny hurricane that unexpectedly became a category three with 115 MPH winds before rapidly falling apart, and Erika...well, Erika needs no introduction.      That brings us to Fred.      Hi Fred.      There it is, spinning very close to the Cape Verde Islands and about 300 miles off the coast of western Africa. Most powerful tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are (in)famous for getting their start in this part of the world—many of the worst hurricanes in history developed as clusters of thunderstorms over sub-Saharan Africa, moving west off the coast where they slowly gather strength as they traverse the bath water that is the Atlantic in late summer. When conditions are right, these systems—called “Cape Verde-type” hurricanes, for obvious reasons—typically turn into ugly storms about halfway between Africa and the Caribbean.      It’s pretty unusual for a system to threaten the Cape Verde Islands as a tropical storm or hurricane. This small island nation has only seen a hurricane twice in recorded history—Debbie back in 1961 and an unnamed hurricane that developed in 1892. Tropical waves usually don’t get their act together this quickly, but Fred’s a freak of nature.      The storm took advantage of a short window with steering currents from the southeast and an environment capable of sustaining a low-end hurricane. The National Hurricane Center doesn’t expect the storm to last much longer—after a period of strengthening today, the hurricane will encounter a hostile environment that should slowly weaken it to nothing by the weekend.      Hurricane Fred will produce heavy rain, flash flooding, mudslides, a small storm surge, and rough waves as it crosses the many islands that make up Cape Verde, a Portuguese-speaking country that’s home to about half a million people. The country’s capital, Praia, should escape the worst of the hurricane—the city is home to about a quarter of the country’s total population.      Given Fred’s unusual nature, it’s posing some unique problems for experts and amateurs alike. A tropical storm or hurricane forming over/near the Cape Verde Islands is so rare that the software that produces the National Hurricane Center’s auto-generated map products doesn’t have the ability to draw watches or warnings for the Cape Verde Islands. You know a storm is strange when the agency responsible for storms in this ocean basin doesn’t have the capability to show your country’s hurricane warning on its maps.      Fred became a hurricane at 22.5°W, securing its second place spot in recorded history. Many more storms could have formed along or east of this line of longitude before the satellite era, but we never would have known about it unless it hit land or ships in its path.      The record for the farthest east a storm has ever become a hurricane in the Atlantic was Vince (above), which fittingly formed during the ridiculous 2005 hurricane season; the season itself probably holds the record for the most records ever broken in one season. Vince formed up near Madeira Island, which is a few hundred miles southwest of Spain. The water is supposed to be too cold in this area to support a hurricane, but Vince proved us wrong, as did just about every other storm that year.      It isn’t 2005 by a longshot, but 2015 has been an interesting season so far. It makes a weather geek wonder: “what’s next?”      (Knock on wood.)

Hawaii on Monday appeared to have dodged a swipe from Hurricane Ignacio, which had substantially weakened to a Category 2 on a five-point scale as it moved hundreds of miles off-shore of the state. But that sense of relief was tempered by the knowledge that the islands are just halfway through the hurricane season and already have seen almost as many named storms as the Pacific region usually gets in an entire period.      Over the weekend, officials recorded three named hurricanes — Ignacio, Kilo and Jimena — and all were as strong as Category 4. Kilo and Jimena are not expected to directly hit the Hawaiian islands. National Weather Service meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said it was possible that Ignacio could stage a dramatic shift toward land, \\"but not likely.”      Even though the storms are forecast to miss Hawaii, officials have had to gear up emergency measures as a precaution. Stores have reported an increase in purchases of emergency supplies, declarations of warning have been issued by state leaders and emergency management officials and hundreds of volunteers have been put at the ready by groups such as the Red Cross.      “This hurricane season seems to be busier than normal,” said Krislyn Yano, communications manager for the state chapter of the Red Cross. “We don’t want residents to get fatigued by the close calls then think we’re invincible” when the storms pass. “We are always trying to be prepared, and we’re only half way through the season. Everyone should always be ready.”      According to Chevalier, a meteorologist for the Honolulu-based Central Pacific Hurricane Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the region averaged 16.6 named storms a year from 1981 to 2010. The largest number, 28, was recorded in 1992 and the fewest, eight, was in 1977 and 2010.      So far, there have been 14 named storms in the region, and the hurricane season, which runs from mid-May to the end of November, is only about half over, he said. The forecast had been for 15 to 22 storms this year, he said.      “This year, we have had a very active hurricane season and the main reason is El Niño,” he explained. The El Niño effect occurs when sea water has a warmer than average temperature.      In general, hurricanes are born in the eastern portion of the Pacific where warm waters generate water vapor and energy that climbs into the air. The heat of the water is like a fuel that feeds the hurricane, making it stronger and fiercer and as it travels over the water.      Normally, the cool ocean water serves as a brake to the growth of hurricanes. But in an El Niño year, the ocean stays warm and continues to feed the baby hurricanes that then can grow into fearsome creatures. The tamest hurricane, as measured on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, starts at 74 miles per hour, the low end of Category 1. The high end of Category 5 is more than 157 miles per hour. The top steps are considered major storms with winds in excess of 112 miles an hour.      “When the hurricanes reach the Hawaiian Islands, the sea surface temperatures are normally relatively cooler, so the storms lose some power. This year is different [because of El Niño] and the hurricanes have maintained their intensity as they move north.”      By Monday, Kilo remained a Category 4 storm, approaching the International Date Line with winds of 135 miles per hour. Jimena, with winds of 150 miles an hour, was more than 1,300 miles east of Hawaii.      Ignacio weakened, with maximum winds of 105 miles per hour. It was forecast to continue to lose power through the week as it moved hundreds of miles past the Big Island and Maui. No coastal warnings or watches were in effect, according to the National Weather Service.      Many storms brush the islands or cause enough disturbance in the ocean to have an effect, Chevalier said. Only four storms have made landfall in Hawaii since 1949; two caused major damage but none since 1992.      Still, for a time all three were Category 4 storms in the same region. Even three Category 3 storms would be a record, Chevalier said.      “I would say it’s very rare, extremely rare,” he said. “I don’t think it has ever happened before.”      michael.muskal@latimes.com      Follow @latmuskal for national news |||||Summary:","output":"Hurricane Fred formed just off the western coast of Africa early on Monday morning, making it the second-farthest east a hurricane has ever formed in the Atlantic Ocean since records began.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit association which regulates athletes of 1,281 institutions, conferences, organizations, and individuals. It also organizes the athletic programs of many colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, and helps more than 450,000 college student-athletes who compete annually in college sports. The organization is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2014, the NCAA generated almost a billion dollars in revenue. 80 to 90% of this revenue was due to the Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. This revenue is then distributed back into various organizations and institutions across the United States.  - The Bowl Alliance was an agreement among college football bowl games (specifically the Sugar, Orange, and Fiesta Bowls) for the purpose of trying to match the top two teams in a national championship bowl game and to provide quality bowl game matchups for the champions of its member conferences.

These actions primarily focus on five key principles: 1. Ownership: Encourage developing countries to exercise strong and effective leadership over their development policies and strategies and coordinate development actions accordingly. 2. Alignment: Align donor countries' support with the priorities, policies, and procedures of developing countries, including using local systems and capacities whenever possible. 3. Harmonization: Streamline and coordinate the efforts and practices of donor countries to minimize the burden on developing nations and improve the overall effectiveness and delivery of aid. 4. Managing for results: Shift the focus of development assistance towards achieving measurable and sustainable results, fostering mutual accountability between donor and recipient countries in the management of aid resources. 5. Mutual accountability: Promote shared responsibility and accountability for development outcomes by engaging with and involving all relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, private sector entities, and government institutions. To ensure the implementation and monitoring of these principles, several rounds of high-level forums have taken place since the Paris Declaration, including the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action and the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation. These forums aim at reviewing progress, setting targets, and promoting inclusive partnerships for development effectiveness. As a result of the Paris Declaration and its subsequent follow-up actions, there have been improvements in aid delivery, effectiveness, and transparency.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

It is possible, for instance, that the man is simply cleaning up his neighborhood, engaging in a community service project, or searching for something of personal value he discarded by accident. Secondly, even if we do assume that the man is homeless, there are still various reasons why he might be picking through the trash beyond looking for soda cans to trade for cash. He might be searching for food, clothing, or any other discarded items that might be of use to him. Additionally, the original statement does not provide information regarding New York City's recycling system or how one might exchange soda cans for cash. While it is common knowledge for many that certain localities allow for the trading of recyclable cans for money, without specific details, we cannot infer the man's intentions based on the provided information.

The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47.  The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road.  Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan.

Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek.  - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover).  - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.  - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide.  - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48.  - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\".  - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa .  - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes.   - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites.  - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas.  - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11  - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod.  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.    What is the relationship between 'medicago falcata' and 'medicago sativa'? A:","output":"Medicago falcata and Medicago sativa are both plant species belonging to the genus Medicago in the family Fabaceae. Both species are types of legumes, and they are often referred to as alfalfa. Medicago falcata, commonly known as sickle alfalfa, sickle medick, yellow lucerne, or yellow-flowered alfalfa, is native to the Mediterranean basin but is found throughout the world. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. On the other hand, Medicago sativa, also known as alfalfa or lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant cultivated as an important forage crop worldwide. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The relationship between Medicago falcata and Medicago sativa lies in their shared genus, legume family, and their ability to establish symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to improve soil fertility. Both species are cultivated for their forage value, particularly for livestock feed. Additionally, interbreeding can occur between the two species, producing hybrid plants with improved stress tolerance and enhanced forage quality."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra.

Well, Louis Braille's work changed the world. Born in a small town near Paris in 1809, shortly after his third birthday Louis blinded himself in one eye while playing with a sharp pointed tool in his father's workshop. He soon lost the sight in his other eye when the infection  spread. He wanted to go to school, but in his small town there was no school for him. At that time, blind people did not get any school education. Braille went to Paris to study, but there were few books for the blind. Louis knew that books were the key to learning. He struggled with ideas for three years. Finally, at fifteen, he invented an alphabet made with raised dots . Blind people could \\"read\\" by feeling the patterns of the dots.

Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

Encourage her to plan ahead to commemorate those days. This can help her create a feeling of continuity with the past or create the sense that you are moving on. While it is particularly useful to develop a ritual for special dates, there is no reason why the griever shouldn’t plan to celebrate or remember the deceased any other day. There is a plethora of rituals he can use to remember his loved lost one. Which one he picks depends on his relationship with the person and what it was that once brought them together. Some examples include:  Preparing a meal that the deceased enjoyed. Watch a movie that the person enjoyed. Go on a walk, possibly where the two of had been in the past, and remember times spent together. Buy flowers on important days. Travel somewhere the deceased wanted to go. Listen to music that reminds the grieving person of the deceased. Look through a photo album. Ask her to write fiction, personal essays, or poetry that expresses and identifies feelings and blockages. You can encourage artists to paint or draw. Starting a journal can be an important step for dealing with emotions.  Ask her to try writing about the life of the person she lost. Alternatively, have her write about how that person has influenced her. Remind her that the deceased lives on through her. Memory books can help in the grieving process. Compile mementos, photos or stories about the deceased person. This helps one come to terms with the magnitude of the loss and to focus on the realities of one’s new life without forgetting the lost loved one. Place an open chair opposite the grieving person and ask her to imagine the deceased person sitting in that chair. Give the bereaved person the opportunity to speak to the person in the chair and say all the things that she would like to have said to that person.  Playing out situations from the past or rehearsing difficult future situations may help bring closure. The use of objects and memorabilia, such as jewelry and other objects which the bereaved person is comfortable with, can be used to facilitate talking and bringing the mourning process to a close. Some people will want to clear their heads or process their loss before trying to commemorate their loved one. Many people have difficulty talking about what has happened. It is your job to give the grieving party ideas about how to move on. It is not your job to force them to do something they do not want to do. Summary:","output":"When someone misses a person they lost, it can be helpful to remember and celebrate that person on special days or any other time. They can do things like making a favorite meal, watching a movie, going for a walk, or looking at pictures. Writing, drawing, or making a memory book can help too. Sometimes talking to an imaginary person in a chair or using special things that belonged to the person can help.

I had a baby here this year and I would never suggest anybody give birth at this hospital. Nurses are rude! I had maybe 1-2 nice nurses. This old lady tried to force kick me out of my room so she can have people clean...ugh I just had a baby dumb dumb. I had random people that werent my nurse coming into my room when I'm breastfeeding my son. They will sometimes use my bathroom area as a kick it spot. So I had to get up out of bed while in pain at least 10 times a day to make sure my door was fully shut so they can't come in. What a pain. Literally. I hAd to also tell all these nurses I've met to close the door behind them because they will leave it open and next thing u know random people is in my room. Dangerous. Even people that aren't employed. The stupid nurse had our paperwork and turned it in having things crossed out without our knowledge and admin won't accept it so now my sons father is not on the birth certificate. Idiot! Little things like that now I have to go correct. I was so drained, tired, and in horrible pain after giving birth I literally couldn't get out of bed fast. Everything was hurting. Then I get this nurse who was trying to force me to go to breastfeeding class after I just told her if it's optional than I'm not going. I read all the breastfeeding things I need to know and etc. I mainly didn't want to go because I couldn't even keep my eyes open. I felt weak and exhausted. She kept forcing me sevetal times after i politely declined every time, but after 20 times trying to make me go i finally stated again to her rudely I'm not going that's the end of it. She backed off. I've been breastfeeding my son for almost a year. I have no problems. Another occasion happened when I took my son in for a circumcision. OMG! After my son went thru surgery, I came back there to calm him down. He was crying hysterically because of course the pain from the surgery. Tell me why this old witch grabs my son from me snd sticks a pedialyte down his throat where his crying was less quiet because the nipple from the bottle was blocking his throat. I told this witch don't be sticking it down his throat to stop him from crying he just came out of surgery. I grabbed my son back and she said he's such a drama queen. Excuse u ugly bitch. That got me mad. My son needed me do much I couldnt curse the bitch out. His crying had me occupied. After taking the bottle out of his mouth his crying was worse! This angers me thinking about it still.  A lot of these do called nurses don't dI their job right.

Article: The patterns of 1792 are among the most intriguing stories in the history of U.S. numismatics. Carl Carlson published an extensive article about them in the March 1982 Numismatist. In this lengthy and worthwhile article, he brought together findings from previous researchers who had examined the series, and led in a methodical fashion queries into when the pieces were struck, by whom, and where they were manufactured. The article leaves open several questions, some of which have yet to be resolved. One is the question of which Birch the coin refers to.      There are two varieties of Birch cents: The “regular” design has BIRCH on the bust truncation and is represented by 15-20 pieces today (including both Judd-4 and Judd-5). The other design is a unique white metal specimen with GWPt on the reverse, an abbreviation for “George Washington President.” As superficially different as these two coins appear, they are actually different engraving states of the same die. The two designs are punch-linked, indicating the same person engraved both at about the same time. The obverses are closer in treatment, but the reverses show evidence of considerably more drastic die work.      The half disme and the Birch cent are definitely related and from the same engraver. The half disme is virtually a mirror image of the Birch cent, with Liberty facing left rather than right as on the cent. Carlson’s article makes a clear case for the time frame of the striking of these coins from a December 1792 letter written by Thomas Jefferson. In this letter he implies there were no cents struck in the Mint itself before December, which leaves production of these coins to sometime before October, when the Mint presses were first operational. This leaves only one possibility for the location of the production of the Birch cents: John Harper’s coach house.      The question of just which Birch was actually responsible for these pattern cents has since proven to be not Thomas Birch, previously believed to have engraved the dies. Thomas Birch was born in England in 1779 and was only 13 years old in 1792. It is more likely that William Russell Birch, a famous Philadelphia miniaturist, visited Philadelphia in the spring and summer of 1792, although he only moved his family there in 1794. Carlson lays out the most logical origin of the Birch cent:      “Were the original ‘GWPt’ dies engraved in Philadelphia, or were they prepared in England prior to Birch’s departure for America to serve as a sample of his work to show Mint officials and Harper upon his arrival? He would certainly have had the necessary contacts at the various private Mints in England to have cut the original dies there and made some trial strikes in white metal as samples. The punches for the cent … were of British origin and do not appear on any dies over here other than the cent. The revised version of the cent required recutting but not punches.”      Questions remain today about the specific origins of the Birch cent. Although we have evidence, we still do not conclusively know: Exactly which Birch was the engraver? Did Birch himself modify the GWPt die? Can these coins be punch-linked to British tokens of the period to identify exactly where the dies were engraved? Nevertheless, the Birch cent shares a prestigious spot in the birth of U.S. coinage, along with the silver center cent, half disme, disme, and Eagle on Globe quarter, all highly interesting and historic issues from the first year the Mint was established. ||||| \\"They are a great store value, and will only be worth more in the future,\\" Lipton said. \\"They are literally Mona Lisas of our coinage.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The patterns of 1792, including the Birch cent, hold a significant place in the history of U.S. numismatics.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When are supplements mainly of assistance to people? Options:  A. When there is a risk of cancer  B. not enough information  C. after the diagnosis of heart disease  D. when dietary sources are inadequate A:","output":"D. when dietary sources are inadequate"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When did the CDs take over? Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). The answer is:","output":"The digital compact discs (CDs) took over the home entertainment market in the late 1980s, when they outsold analog disc records."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back A:","output":"The final step of the process involving waves hitting the coast, having energy that pushes water and sediment, the sediment eroding land like sandpaper, and water washing the sediment back can be described as follows: After the water has washed the sediment back into the ocean, the process now enters a stage called sediment transport and deposition. This is the final step of this coastal process known as coastal erosion and sedimentation. Sediment transport refers to the movement of eroded sediment materials by the action of waves, currents, or other natural agents. In the context of this process, the waves carry the eroded sediment materials back into the ocean, where they are transported along the coast or moved even further offshore depending on the strength of the waves and currents. As the sediment materials are transported, they will eventually be deposited in new locations when the energy of the waves and currents decreases. These locations can be along the same coastline or completely different shores, depending on the distances traveled and available depositional environments, such as beaches, estuaries, or underwater deposits like sandbars. Sediment deposition is a vital part of this process as it contributes to the formation of new landforms, such as sand dunes, barrier islands, and deltas. These depositional landforms not only provide habitats for various plants and animals but also act as a buffer against strong waves, proving stability and protection to the coastline. Throughout this entire process, the coast is continually being reshaped due to the interaction of waves, coastal landforms, and sediment materials. These dynamic changes ensure that coastal environments remain some of the most diverse and fascinating ecosystems on our planet. In summary, the final step of the process is the sediment transport and deposition, resulting in the formation of new landforms and contributing to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of our coastlines. This process helps maintain the ecological and geological balance of these important ecosystems, which are vital for preserving coastal biodiversity and supporting human populations who depend on coastal resources for their livelihoods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella. She uses the wand to expand the slipper so that it can fit Anastasia, and the Grand Duke declares she must be the girl the Prince is looking for. Cinderella arrives on the scene too late, and Lady Tremaine destroys Cinderella's other slipper – the only clue to her identity that she was the girl who danced with the Prince on the night of the ball.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved. Morrison resolves to never let that happen, and Donatti hopes so for her sake. Two weeks later, Dick is at a party where he is the only guest...

A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. The extremely rare archive boasts almost 200 posters issued between 1914 and 1916, which hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting. They highlight the increasingly menacing tone used in the run-up to compulsory conscription in 1916 after Britain suffered so many losses on the Western Front. Hidden history: A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. These two posters from 1915 (left) and 1914 (right) hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting. Haul: Arthur Maxted inherited the collection, including this pair from 1915) from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. He kept them in his attic for 30 years and only realised their true value recently. Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. Mr Maxted has kept the posters in the loft of his home in Kent for the past 30 years, forgetting all about them, and only realised their true importance recently when he started researching and documenting the collection. Now, 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. 'The posters were collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war,' said 72-year-old Mr Maxted. 'It is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as they were not of any monetary worth back then. Collection: 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters, such as this one which urged men of all backgrounds to enlist, are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. Justice: These two posters feature Britannia and urge men to recall the deadly December 1914 raid by the Imperial German navy on Scarborough (left) and the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1198 lives (right) Anger: This poster (left) also recalls the sinking of the Lusitania as well as other wartime atrocities, while a 1917 design sought to remind men that others, including women and children, were doing their bit. 'My aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years in my loft. 'It was only recently that I started to document them and realised they might be quite valuable.' The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops. They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. Change: When it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled and recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Mission: The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops, and were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain’s declaration of war against Germany. Many thought the war was an opportunity for adventure with friends - but when it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled. Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Tragedy: Another poster with its focus on the Scarborough raid, this time showing a damaged home and a little girl left alone to care for a baby. Messages included ‘Why aren’t you in khaki? You’ll be wanted. Enlist at once’, ‘Don’t stand looking at this - go and help!’ and ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’. Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. One read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back on your account. Won’t you prove your love for your Country by persuading them to go?' Target: Many posters, such as these two from 1915, targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. Appeal: This 1915 poster (left) was also geared towards women, telling them their the safety of their children depended on men going out to fight, while another played on the insecurities of fathers who wanted to make their children proud. By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in August 1914. 'As a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which were put up in public places. Positive: The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain¿s declaration of war against Germany. 'Interestingly, the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit men changed. 'Many of the early posters depended on patriotism. 'Early. recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be. missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over. by Christmas 1914. 'Initially. these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits. but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers. 'As. it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first. thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed. Output: By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. This poster from 1916 (right), bearing the message 'Forward', was the last printed before forced enlistment was introduced. Collection: Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions with the collection of posters. They are expected to reach £20,000 when they go up for auction on July 9. 'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’ 'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight. 'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.' The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9. At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of 'Pals battalions' from the same workplace, football team or friendship group. However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits. Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service. The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers. Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal. Married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second Act in May 1916, and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51. Conscripted men were not given a choice of which service, regiment or unit they joined. However, if they expressed a preference to join the Navy then it had first refusal on whether to take him. Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year. Source: www.parliament.uk.

Science, Mathematics, and Social Science: This part of the SAT evaluates the student's knowledge, understanding, and application of concepts they have studied in the fields of Science, Mathematics, and Social Science. Topics cover a wide range of subjects from the latest syllabus of class 9 and class 10, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, History, Geography, Political Science, and Economics. Do those questions have the same meaning? Yes, both questions are asking for the syllabus of NTSE, the National Talent Search Examination. While one specifically asks for the syllabus of NTSE 2016, understanding the general structure and subjects covered remains important as it provides context that the 2016 syllabus also follows a similar structure. The answer provided encapsulates the overall framework, while the specific focus areas may have slight variations from year to year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: What is food that is able to be eaten? Options: - spoiled - necessary to live - edible - supermarket - unhealthy  Explain why a human would choose \\"edible\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"edible\\" to answer the question above because it is the best fitting option for describing food that is able to be eaten. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this choice: 1. First, let's analyze each option to see how it relates to food that is able to be eaten.    a. Spoiled - This describes food that has gone bad and is not suitable for consumption.    b. Necessary to live - While this describes an important attribute of food, it does not directly indicate if it's suitable for eating.    c. Edible - This term directly relates to whether something can be eaten or not.    d. Supermarket - This is a place where people buy food but does not describe the quality or characteristics of the food itself.    e. Unhealthy - This describes a negative attribute of food and its potential impact on health. However, it does not necessarily mean that the food is inedible. 2. Since the question specifically asks for food that is able to be eaten, it is essential to consider which option answers this directly. From the options given, \\"edible\\" fits this description, as it refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. 3. The other options have varying degrees of relevance, such as \\"necessary to live\\" and \\"unhealthy,\\" but none of them is as pertinent to the question as \\"edible.\\"  4. Thus, a human will choose \\"edible\\" as the answer to the question because it accurately and precisely addresses the given problem, and none of the other options do so as effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reasoning behind this is that it mentions a man approaching a weight (which could be the \\"large and heavy weight\\" from the initial scenario), and a woman watching from the side (which could be the \\"woman in a suit\\").

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The Friday after the American holiday of Thanksgiving is called Black Friday. It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash  prices to get consumers to buy.  It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. \\"It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,\\" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. \\"I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,\\" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. \\"This is a huge time for the retail stores,\\" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. \\"This is when they begin making their profits for the year.\\" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed.  Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go. Sandy Thomas says it's an annual family tradition and well worth it. \\"I just save maybe half of what I would have spent on a regular, you know, shopping trip,\\" she... Question: Why are many stores increasing security according to the passage? Options: A: Because there are too many people saving more and spending less.

In the premise, we have the definition of kofte being meatballs made from minced lamb, typically served with a tomato sauce. This suggests that kofte may sometimes be served with tomato sauce, but not always as it says \\"usually\\" and not \\"always.\\" In the hypothesis, it states that kofte is a dish of lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce. This implies that the dish always has a tomato sauce accompanying the lamb meatballs. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis. Although the hypothesis is close to the premise, the hypothesis implies that kofte always has a tomato sauce, while the premise only says that it is \\"usually\\" served with a tomato sauce. This suggests that there might be cases where kofte is served without a tomato sauce. Step 4: Choose the appropriate option. Available options:  A). yes.  B). it is not possible to tell.  C). no.

Now, in order to isolate the y term, we need to get rid of the constant on the left side. We can do this by subtracting both sides of the equation by 82: 81*y + 82 - 82 = 82 - 82 81*y = 0 Step 3: Isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by its coefficient. We need to isolate y to find its value. To do this, we should divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 81: 81*y / 81 = 0 / 81 y = 0 The value of y that satisfies the equation 81*y - 82 + 164 = 82 is y = 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options:  (a). no  (b). yes","output":"(a). no Although these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the same information. There are differences in the specific details and sequence of events they present. Let's break down each sentence to understand the differences better. Sentence 1: \\"If maximum concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before toxic toxicity occurs.\\" In this sentence, the primary focus is on the maximum concentrations being reached first. It suggests that after maximum concentrations have been reached, toxicity (harmful effects due to the presence of a toxic substance) may not be immediate. There might be a delay of one or two days before the organism or system experiences toxic effects. This sentence highlights the fact that even when the maximum concentration of a toxic substance is present, it may take some time for the toxicity to manifest. Sentence 2: \\"When toxic concentrations are reached, there may be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity occurs.\\" In contrast, the second sentence focuses on toxic concentrations being reached first. Once the toxic concentrations have been reached, it will not immediately result in maximum toxicity (the highest degree of harmful effects caused by the toxic substance) in the organism or system. There could be a delay of one or two days before maximum toxicity is observed. This sentence emphasizes that reaching toxic concentrations does not instantly lead to the most severe toxic effects but may take some time to develop. In summary, while both sentences discuss the presence of toxic substances and a delay in experiencing their harmful effects, the order of events and their focus are different. Sentence 1 focuses on reaching maximum concentrations first and then waiting for toxicity to occur, while Sentence 2 focuses on reaching toxic concentrations first and then waiting for maximum toxicity to occur. Therefore, the two sentences do not convey the same information, and the answer to this question is (a). no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Write an article that answers the following question: What country provided reinforcements?","output":"Title: Uncovering the Country That Provided Reinforcements: A Deep Dive into the World of Military Support Introduction Throughout history, numerous countries have provided reinforcements to their allies and partners in various military endeavors. It is essential to understand the context and motives behind these supportive actions to better grasp international relations and military strategies. In this article, we shall investigate which nation provided reinforcements and the underlying reasons for their commitment to this action. Context and Scenario Given the numerous instances of countries offering military assistance, it is crucial to identify the specific scenario in question that entails reinforcements from one nation to another. Reinforcements can materialize as troop deployments, military hardware supplies, financial backing, or logistical support. These measures heavily depend on the political alignment, nature of conflict, and geographic proximity of the countries involved. Therefore, to provide an accurate response, we shall discuss one of the major recent events where a country extended significant reinforcements - the Russian support to Syria during the ongoing Syrian Civil War. Russia's Intervention in the Syrian Civil War The Syrian Civil War began in 2011, when pro-democracy protests erupted across the country. The government's violent response further ignited the unrest, leading to the formation of various opposition groups and foreign involvement. As a crucial ally of the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad, Russia entered the fray in 2015, providing reinforcements in the form of air support, military advisors, and equipment. Reasons for Russia's Involvement There are several reasons why Russia decided to provide reinforcements to the Syrian government: 1. Strategic Interests: Russia has maintained a naval base in Tartus, Syria, since 1971, which is the only Russian naval base in the Mediterranean region. Securing this base and expanding its military presence in the Middle East was of high importance to Russia as it directly affects its geopolitical ambitions. 2. Counterterrorism Objectives: The presence of the Islamic State (IS) and other extremist factions in Syria posed a severe threat to Russian citizens and national security, given the likelihood of radicalized fighters returning to Russia. By combating terror groups within Syria, Russia sought to limit and eliminate these potential risks. 3. International Influence and Image: Russia's intervention served to strengthen its role in regional and global politics. By supporting Syria, Russia displayed its capacity to project power and influence events beyond its borders. Furthermore, it reaffirmed its commitment to its allies, creating an image of a reliable partner in the international arena. 4. Economic Considerations: Russia's economy heavily relies on energy exports. Given the significant gas and oil reserves present in the region, Russian involvement aimed to secure access to these resources and maintain influence over their distribution. Outcome and Impact of Russia's Reinforcements  Russia's support has had a profound impact on the Syrian Civil War. Its military intervention has bolstered the capabilities of Syrian government forces, allowing them to recover territories lost to opposition groups and secure key areas. Moreover, it strengthened the regime's political position, showcased Russia's military prowess, and shifted the balance of power in the conflict. Additionally, Russia's involvement has ensured that any negotiated settlement in Syria would have to involve Moscow's participation, guaranteeing its influence over Syria's future. Lastly, Russia's military maneuvers within the conflict have led to criticism from Western nations, further highlighting the increasing geopolitical rift between Russia and the West. Conclusion In conclusion, while many nations have provided reinforcements throughout history, Russia is the principal country that extended substantial support in the context of the Syrian Civil War. It provided critical military aid to the Syrian government, motivated by protecting strategic interests, combating terrorism, strengthening international influence, and securing access to the region's energy resources. Russia's reinforcements have played an undeniable role in shaping the outcome of the ongoing conflict and ensuring Moscow's place as a major player on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: In March 2003, a second rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia, began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast. Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year, and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month. By July 2003, the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia. Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement, Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria. What is \\"Movement For democracy in Liberia\\"?","output":"The Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) is a rebel group that was formed in March 2003 during the Second Liberian Civil War. Its primary objective was to challenge the rule of then-President Charles Taylor and bring about democratic change in Liberia, a West African nation that had been plagued by political instability and civil strife for several years. MODEL emerged as the second major insurgent group in Liberia, alongside the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). The group began launching attacks against Taylor's forces from the southeastern regions of the country. Aiming to restore democracy and address human rights abuses in Liberia, MODEL quickly gained momentum and support. Its actions put additional pressure on Charles Taylor's government, which was already facing challenges from LURD. As the conflict intensified, peace talks between the various factions, including the government and rebel groups, commenced in Accra, Ghana in June 2003. In the same month, the Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted Charles Taylor for crimes against humanity, charging him with orchestrating violence, murder, rape, and the use of child soldiers during the Sierra Leone Civil War. These developments further weakened Taylor's position and authority in Liberia. By July 2003, MODEL and LURD rebels had launched a joint assault on Monrovia, Liberia's capital city. Amidst this chaos, a domestic peace movement called Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace played a significant role in advocating for an end to the violence and pressing for Taylor's resignation. The international community likewise put heavy pressure on Taylor to step down. Eventually, Charles Taylor resigned in August 2003, subsequently going into exile in Nigeria. His resignation marked the beginning of the end of the Second Liberian Civil War and paved the way for Liberia's transition to a more democratic and stable political climate, with the establishment of a transitional government and later, successful general elections in 2005."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Question: \\"What was the amount that the plotters used to fund their attack?Which entities funded these plotters?\\" Answer: \\"Between 400,000 and 500,000. Al Queda funded the plotters\\" Is this answer correct?

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.  Question: \\"What is picked up by the water?\\" Answer: \\"Stalactites\\" Is this answer correct? Available choices: (a). no. (b). yes....I think the answer is","output":"(a). no. The answer \\"Stalactites\\" is incorrect because stalactites are mineral deposits that form inside caves as water continues to drip.

In the English language, the verb \\"take\\" can have several different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the different meanings of \\"take\\" in them. Sentence 1:  \\"Tomorrow the doctor will take the cast off her arm.\\" In this sentence, \\"take\\" is used in the context of removing something from a particular place or position. The doctor is removing the cast from the patient's arm. Here, \\"take\\" denotes an action of separation, detaching, or clearing away an object, specifically the cast, from the patient's arm. This usage of \\"take\\" is often associated with the idea of getting rid of something or ceasing its connection from where it was originally attached. Sentence 2:  \\"Can you take this bag, please.\\" In this sentence, \\"take\\" has a different meaning. It is used to request someone to hold, carry, or accept something, in this case, the bag. The speaker is asking someone else to assume responsibility or possession of the bag, either to help them with a task or to transfer ownership temporarily. In this context, the primary focus of \\"take\\" is on the action of acquiring or receiving something from someone else. To summarize, while both sentences use the verb \\"take,\\" they convey different meanings in each context. In Sentence 1, \\"take\\" refers to the action of removing a cast, while in Sentence 2, \\"take\\" means to accept, hold or carry a bag. The versatility of the verb \\"take\\" in the English language allows it to adopt different meanings based on the situation, making it essential to consider the context in which it is used to understand its meaning accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Valencia Cathedral was called Iglesia Mayor in the early days of the Reconquista, then Iglesia de la Seo (Seo is from the Latin sedes, i.e., (archiepiscopal) See), and by virtue of the papal concession of 16 October 1866, it was called the Basilica Metropolitana. It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood. In Gothic times, it seems to have been dedicated to the Holy Saviour; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; King James I of Aragon did likewise, leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin, which he carried with him and is reputed to be the one now preserved in the sacristy. The Moorish mosque, which had been converted into a Christian Church by the conqueror, was deemed unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andrés de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three naves; these reach only to the choir of the present building. Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the chapter hall, and James I added the tower, called El Miguelete because it was blessed on St. Michael's day in 1418.

Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining.

It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it.

I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water. I have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don’t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news.

After three misses she finally got a hit.","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"hit\\" does not carry the same meaning. In each sentence, \\"hit\\" takes on a different connotation based on the context. Let's closely examine these sentences to determine the differences in meaning. 1. Where am I going to get my next hit? In this sentence, \\"hit\\" likely refers to a dose of a drug, such as an illicit substance or legal medication. In this context, a \\"hit\\" implies a desired, satisfying, or pleasurable effect resulting from the drug's consumption. The speaker may be asking where they can obtain their next dose or potentially seeking the next source of pleasure, often implying a sense of dependency or addiction. 2. After three misses, she finally got a hit. In this sentence, \\"hit\\" refers to a successful outcome or accomplishment, often following other failed attempts (\\"misses\\"). Without additional context, it may be challenging to pinpoint the specific activity in question; however, the usage of \\"hit\\" here generally implies a tangible result. For instance, this phrase could pertain to a sports context (e.g., a baseball player successfully hitting a ball), a strategic game (e.g., a board game like Battleship), or even target practice at the shooting range. In summary, although \\"hit\\" appears in both sentences, the word holds distinct meanings in each case: 1. A dose of a drug/pleasurable effect 2. A successful outcome or accomplishment The context within which \\"hit\\" is employed ultimately determines its meaning, demonstrating the importance of context when interpreting language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

The group also raises funds for the Cinema for Peace Foundation and other charities.  - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined.  - Dancer in the Dark ( Danish : Danser i mørket ) is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk , Catherine Deneuve , David Morse , Cara Seymour , Peter Stormare , Siobhan Fallon Hogan , and Joel Grey .

She appeared in films such as \\"Men in Black\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"The Negotiator\\" and \\"Daddy Day Care\\".    What is the relationship between 'dancer in the dark' and 'color'? A:","output":"\\"Dancer in the Dark\\" is a 2000 Danish musical drama film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Icelandic singer Björk, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, and Joel Grey. The film is focused on Selma (played by Björk), a Czech immigrant who is slowly losing her eyesight due to a genetic disorder and struggles to save enough money for an operation that could prevent her son from suffering the same fate.  In terms of the film's relationship with color, \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" utilizes a distinct visual style to enhance its narrative and evoke emotions. For most of the film, the color palette is deliberately muted, with dark and dull tones dominating the scenes. This choice of color reflects Selma's deteriorating vision and her bleak reality, adding to the film's overall atmosphere of despair and hardship. However, there are moments in the film where Selma escapes her grim reality through her love for musicals and her daydreams. In these moments, which take the form of visually and musically distinct sequences, the color palette shifts to much brighter and more vibrant tones. The use of color in these sequences conveys a sense of optimism, fantasy, and hope, contrasting sharply with the somber tones present in Selma's everyday life. In conclusion, the relationship between \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" and color lies in the way the film effectively employs different color schemes to represent its protagonist's emotional states and highlight the contrast between her harsh reality and her optimistic daydreams. The use of color serves as a crucial narrative device that enhances the story's emotional impact and helps to convey its themes of struggle, sacrifice, and hope."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The reasons for historical change are multifaceted and complex, influenced by a combination of factors such as economic developments, technological innovations, social and cultural shifts, political events, and the actions of individuals. Analyzing and understanding these changes in history is important for gaining insights into the development of societies and the world as a whole. The given statement, \\"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation,\\" highlights the broad and diverse nature of historical inquiry. While this statement accurately reflects the scope of historical studies, it does not directly address the reasons for historical change. However, it can be viewed as a stepping stone to understanding those reasons. Here is a more focused answer regarding the reasons for historical change: Historical change can be attributed to a variety of factors and influences. Some common reasons for historical change include: 1. Economic factors: Changes in trade, industry, and economic systems can lead to significant shifts in the course of history. Examples include the Industrial Revolution and the spread of capitalism. 2. Technological advancements: Innovations in technology can drive historical change by improving communication, transportation, and production methods. The invention of the printing press, for example, facilitated the spread of information and ideas, sparking the Protestant Reformation and the Renaissance. 3. Social and cultural factors: Shifts in social and cultural norms, beliefs, and values can also contribute to historical change. Key examples include the women's rights movement, the civil rights movement, and the LGBTQ+ rights movement. 4. Political events and decisions: The actions of political leaders, the establishment or collapse of governments and empires, and the outcome of wars and conflicts can all lead to changes in the course of history. 5. The actions of individuals: Sometimes the actions of individuals or small groups can produce significant change on a historical scale. For example, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is credited with sparking World War I. Therefore, while the given statement provides a reasonable introduction to the scope of historical study, a more direct answer on the reasons for historical change might focus on specific factors such as economic developments, technological advancements, social and cultural forces, political events, and individual actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to Sahih al-Bukhari, the Quran was recited among Levantines and Iraqis, and discussed by Christians and Jews, before it was standardized. Its language was similar to the Syriac language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament. Muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the Bible and other Jewish and Christian writings and Islamic dispensations is due to their common divine source,[citation needed] and that the original Christian or Jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who has claimed that Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before it took on its standardized Arabic form?","output":"The claim that Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before it took on its standardized Arabic form is not explicitly found in Sahih al-Bukhari or other primary Islamic sources. However, the Quran does acknowledge the existence of previous scriptures, and Muslims believe that the Jewish and Christian texts, such as the Torah and Gospel, have common origins with the Quran, as they are all believed to come from the same divine source. As for the claim that its language was similar to the Syriac language, it could be based on the research of scholars who have studied the influences and connections between Syriac (Aramaic) and the Arabic language. It is important to recognize that early Islamic history and the emergence of the Quran took place in a multicultural context, where various Semitic languages, including Syriac, were spoken and used for liturgical purposes. The idea that Jewish and Christian communities in the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant were exposed to the Quran before it was standardized may be conceivable due to the interactions and cultural exchanges among these religious communities. However, it is important to note that this claim is not explicitly present in the primary Islamic sources, such as Sahih al-Bukhari.  Nonetheless, the Quran does emphasize the shared prophetic history among the Abrahamic religions and features many of the prophets and stories found in the Jewish and Christian texts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... According to the above context, answer the following question.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon.

The mother was more aesthetic, so in her garden of vegetables and flowers, there were more of the","output":"latter. Vibrant colors danced among the lush greenery, as she had meticulously selected each plant for its visual appeal. Roses, lilies, and tulips brushed elbows with daffodils, sunflowers, and lavender, creating a spectacle of hues and fragrances that captivated anyone who passed by. Step 1: Assess the current direction of the story Given the focus on the mother's garden and the beautiful plants she has cultivated, the story currently centers on the mother's dedication to her garden and her love of nature. Step 2: Consider potential developments Potential avenues to explore include the impact the garden has on the mother's relationships, challenges the mother might face in tending to her garden, or the garden's influence on others in the community. Step 3: Choose a direction to take the story Focusing on the garden's influence on others in the community allows for exploration of themes such as the power of nature and the importance of nurturing beauty. Step 4: Develop the chosen direction As the mother's garden grew, it soon became more than a personal haven for her and her family. People from around the neighborhood would take detours on their daily commutes just to catch a glimpse of the breathtaking array of flowers, and some would even stop to chat with the mother about her botanical pursuits. One day, a young girl named Lucy approached the garden along with her grandfather. She was taken aback by the dazzling assortment of flora, and the rich scents that enveloped her senses. As they neared, her grandfather noticed the mother working on a particularly delicate vining plant, its tendrils wrapping around the base of a trellis. Step 5: Introduce conflict Introducing a conflict will help to create tension and sustain interest in the story. In this case, a conflict can emerge from the beauty of the garden being threatened by external factors such as environmental issues or changes in the mother's life. Step 6: Develop the conflict As the gardening season progressed, the mother noticed signs of a new threat to her carefully curated domain. A prolonged drought in the region had left many plants thirsty for water, and local resources were being rationed to reserve sufficient water for drinking and essential needs. With each passing day, the mother could see the leaves of her plants wilting and blossoms fading, and she began to worry that her oasis might be doomed. Step 7: Resolve the conflict To resolve the conflict, the mother and the community work together to address the problem and ensure the survival of her garden. In doing so, they enrich their relationships and gain a deeper appreciation for the process of nurturing and preserving beauty. Step 8: Develop the resolution Word of the mother's struggle reached beyond her usual circle of admirers, and neighbors banded together to offer support. People shared tips for water-saving gardening methods, others suggested collecting rainwater during the sparse showers, and some even offered to share their own limited supplies to save the endangered plants. The mother, moved by this outpouring of compassion, vowed to find a sustainable solution to preserve her garden, not only for her own pleasure but for the community that had grown around it. In the end, even Lucy and her grandfather contributed to the garden's salvation, and its lasting beauty served as a lasting testament to the community's collective dedication. United by their shared love of nature and a desire to protect it, the mother and her neighbors looked proudly upon the garden as a symbol of unity, hope, and the power of rejuvenation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Associated  Press Reporter At least 28 bodies have been recovered from a mass grave in Veracruz, an eastern Mexican state plagued by attacks on migrants and drug cartel violence, officials said Wednesday.

The gruesome discovery highlights the ongoing issue of widespread violence and organized crime that continues to grip the region, causing anguish and fear among local communities. Amidst this climate of fear and insecurity, countless families have reported their loved ones missing, with some even forming support groups to actively search for their missing family members, urging authorities to take more effective actions against the cartels and protect innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. In recent years, multiple mass graves have been unearthed in the eastern Mexican state, bringing to light the enormity of the challenge faced by law enforcement and the government to dismantle the powerful criminal organizations operating with near impunity. Just last year, 166 skulls were found in a mass grave near the city of Veracruz, in what was considered one of the largest clandestine burial sites in the country. These mass graves serve as a chilling reminder of the human cost of the drug war, which has claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 people since 2006. As the Mexican authorities double down on their efforts to combat the cartels, many communities are increasingly swept up in cycles of violence and retribution fueled by deep-rooted structural issues, including poverty, corruption, and weak governance. This longstanding crisis has left many Mexicans feeling abandoned and disillusioned by the state's inability to protect them, spurring calls for a new approach in tackling organized crime and drug trafficking. Some proposals for alternative strategies include the decriminalization or legalization of certain narcotics, the strengthening of social programs to provide educational and economic opportunities for those at risk of falling into the world of crime, and the creation of more effective witness protection and victim support systems. While such strategies are not without their controversies and challenges, they signal a growing recognition of the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to addressing the complex and interconnected issues driving the violence and insecurity in Mexico. Amid this struggle, the discovery of the 28 bodies in Veracruz serves as a somber reminder of the urgency of finding a more effective solution to the ongoing challenge of cartel violence and the relentless price paid by countless innocent lives. Time and again, the mass graves bear witness to the need for concerted action and a renewed commitment to addressing the root causes of this crisis, in order to ensure that the people of Mexico can finally live free from fear and pursue their dreams in safety and dignity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather? ?  Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the...

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who has less abnormal cells in their body?  Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably.

I read this background article the other day: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.

Summarize the following: Exercising depletes the body of essential nutrients and fluids. In order to make your workout successful, you have to replace these to help your body recover and build muscle. Use the ingredients suggested in this section to put together a high-quality meal that will help you build muscle and avoid affecting your blood sugar. Protein is the essential ingredient for building muscle. While doing your weight training regimen, include proteins in every one of your meals to give your body the building blocks it needs to strengthen your muscles. There are many options for including protein in your diet.  Nuts. Any kind of nut is high in protein. You can't go wrong including these in your meals or just snacking on them throughout the day. Beans. Not only do these give you a high dose of protein, but they have a low glycemic index, so they won't affect your blood sugar. If using canned beans, be sure to drain the liquid so you don't overdose on sodium. Fat-free dairy products. Milk and yogurt are great sources of protein. Have a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt for an easy dose of protein. Fish. Salmon, tuna, and herring are usually considered the best options for protein, but any fish will do as well. Make sure you avoid fried fish, however, or you'll consume saturated fats that could be harmful. You need carbohydrates in your diet because without them, your body will use protein for energy. This will divert protein from your muscles and you won't build any mass. Carbohydrates from bleached or enriched products like white bread have a high glycemic index and will raise your blood sugar. Whole wheat products, however, will give you non-enriched carbohydrates. Eat whole wheat bread, pasta, and cereals to give yourself a good serving of carbohydrates. It is a fallacy that we should cut fat out of our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be avoided, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for your health. They can reduce your cholesterol levels and also help you build muscle. Try some of these foods for good sources of good fats.  Avocados. Fish. Salmon and sardines contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil. Seeds, especially sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds.","output":"Regular exercise leads to the depletion of essential nutrients and fluids in the body, making it crucial to replace them for successful muscle recovery and growth. A well-rounded meal that helps build muscle and maintains stable blood sugar levels should be rich in protein, carbohydrates, and some healthy fats.  Protein is a vital component in muscle building and should be incorporated into every meal during your weight training regimen. There are numerous protein-rich options to choose from, including nuts, beans, fat-free dairy products, and fish. Nuts can be easily integrated into meals or consumed as snacks, while beans provide not only protein but also have a low glycemic index, making them an ideal choice for maintaining blood sugar levels. Fat-free dairy products like milk and yogurt are also convenient sources of protein. Fish, especially salmon, tuna, and herring, contain high amounts of protein, but it's essential to avoid fried fish to minimize the intake of harmful saturated fats. Carbohydrates are necessary in your diet as they provide energy, preventing your body from utilizing protein as a fuel source. Consuming whole wheat products, such as bread, pasta, and cereals, offers non-enriched carbohydrates without causing a drastic increase in blood sugar levels. Contrary to common belief, not all fats need to be eliminated from our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be limited, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for overall health, cholesterol management, and muscle building. Healthy fat sources include avocados, fish like salmon and sardines (high in omega-3 fatty acids), olive oil, and seeds such as sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds. In summary, to support muscle growth and maintain stable blood sugar levels, it is essential to consume a balanced diet comprising of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Incorporating a variety of nutrient-rich whole foods can aid in efficient muscle recovery and overall well-being during an exercise regimen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In both sentences, it is mentioned that Mercer has two brothers, George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and he is also the father of Charles Fenton Mercer.

However, when interpreting the sentence as a whole, it is understood that all the relationships refer to Mercer. In Sentence 2, the relationships are separated by a conjunction \\"and\\" which makes the meaning of the sentence more clear. The sentence states that Mercer is the brother of two siblings, George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and then uses the conjunction \\"and\\" to state that Mercer is also the father of Charles Fenton Mercer.

Question: Who was the enemy? Context: Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

Following West Virginia's victory over UCF, the head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers, Rich Rodriguez, began to focus his attention on their next matchup, which was against No. [opponent's rank and team name not provided]. In this context, West Virginia's football team may have been engaged in a series of games over the season. The match against Central Florida was significant as it was an opportunity for both teams to showcase their talents and gain crucial match experience. The game took place in an intense and challenging environment due to the steamy weather conditions in Orlando. This posed a test for the players, as they needed to overcome both physical and mental fatigue in order to secure victory. Coach Rich Rodriguez, who was the head coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers at the time, played a key role in guiding his team to victory. As a college football coach, Rodriguez's responsibilities extended beyond just the technical and physical aspects of the game. He was also responsible for instilling discipline, teamwork, and motivation in his players, as well as helping them develop their skills and grow as athletes. When West Virginia managed to defeat Central Florida, the ordeal didn't end there. Rodriguez had to quickly shift gears and start preparing his team for their next opponent, who was ranked in whatever ranking system was being used at the time. This demonstrates the demands placed on college football coaches, as they constantly need to maintain focus on both short-term and long-term objectives in order to succeed in a highly competitive environment. The next game against the ranked opponent promised to be a more formidable challenge, as facing a highly-ranked team generally means they possess a stronger team with more talented players. In addition, such teams often have significant support from fans, adding to the pressure on opposing teams. This makes it even more essential for coaches like Rodriguez to implement effective strategies and tactics, make sound decisions, and keep his team focused and motivated throughout the entire season. It's worth noting that this particular situation highlights the importance of adaptability and resilience in both individual athletes and team dynamics. Players need to be capable of adjusting to different opponents, environmental conditions, and game situations. Coaches like Rodriguez are instrumental in facilitating this adaptability, while also providing support and guidance for their players as they navigate the challenges of a demanding college football season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? Neil but not Kyle was more likely to be prepared in an emergency situation because  Pick from: + Neil panicked.. + Kyle panicked..","output":"Kyle panicked.  From this sentence, we can infer a lot about the characteristics, abilities, and personalities of both Neil and Kyle in the face of a challenging situation like an emergency.  Let's say, hypothetically, that Neil and Kyle are field operators in a company that often makes them confront unpredictable situations. In such high-stake environments, one’s ability to hold their nerve, think clearly, and act decisively can be the thin line between tragedy and survival. This sentence suggests that Neil was better equipped for such high-pressure situations, probably because of his higher stress tolerance, better crisis management skills, or simply a more composed demeanor under pressure. On the other hand, the sentence indicates that Kyle was more likely to panic in an emergency situation. This could mean that he was less prepared to deal with such circumstances than Neil. Kyle’s reaction to an emergency situation might involve extreme anxiety and excessive worry, making his decision-making process slow and ineffective. Panic is usually a sudden overwhelming fear that can cloud judgement and impede action. When a person panics, they might freeze up, make rash decisions, or simply be unable to make any decision at all. This is likely what happens to Kyle in emergency situations, and it makes him less reliable or capable compared to Neil in these circumstances. This conclusion is based on the information provided. Of course, panicking is a human response, and there are ways Kyle can improve his reactions to emergencies, such as by training, gaining experience, or learning stress management techniques. Overall, the sentence, \\"Neil but not Kyle was more likely to be prepared in an emergency situation because Kyle panicked..\\" suggests that in a dire situation, Neil remains calm and is likely to respond effectively, while Kyle is apt to panic and respond less efficiently. This also implies that Neil’s emergency preparedness makes him a more reliable choice in critical conditions compared to Kyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why dowries are taken in olden days?","output":"No, the following two questions are not the same. They address two distinct topics related to the customs and practices of the past. Let's briefly analyze each question to understand why they are different. 1. In olden days, how did soldiers manage to fight from dawn to dusk? This question pertains to the military practices of the past, specifically focusing on the endurance and stamina of soldiers in battle. To answer this question, we would have to look at various factors such as training, motivation, tactics, strategies, and the societal norms of combat at the time. In the olden days, soldiers trained rigorously to build strength and stamina, which allowed them to engage in prolonged battle. Military training often involved intense physical activity, martial arts, and weapon handling. Soldiers also needed to be mentally and emotionally prepared to face the hardships of war. This preparation was achieved through discipline, camaraderie, and bonding with fellow soldiers. The motivation to fight was usually rooted in factors like the protection of one's homeland, religious beliefs, or loyalty to a ruler. As a result, soldiers were often driven by a strong sense of purpose and duty, which allowed them to maintain their energy and focus for extended periods. In terms of tactics and strategies, armies would employ a variety of methods to ensure their soldiers could continue fighting for long durations. These methods included the rotation of soldiers on the front lines, utilizing reserves to replace tired or injured personnel, and planning the deployment of forces according to their physical and mental capabilities. 2. Why were dowries taken in olden days? This question deals with the cultural and social practice of dowry, a system through which the bride's family provides financial support to the groom's family during marriage. This topic is unrelated to the military practices and focuses on the social customs and traditions of societies in the past. The dowry system has its roots in various historical, cultural, social, and economic factors. Some possible reasons for the practice of dowry in the olden days include: - Financial security: Dowry helped to provide the receiving family with a financial cushion, ensuring the bride’s ongoing financial security and well-being within her new family. - Property and inheritance: In patriarchal societies, where property and inheritance were usually passed down to male heirs, dowry allowed brides to retain a share of their familial wealth, which they would bring into the marriage. - Social status: A significant dowry could elevate the social standing of both families involved, as it showcased their ability to offer wealth and indicated a favorable alliance between two families. - Gender imbalance: In some societies, the dowry system became prevalent due to a skewed gender ratio, resulting in a decreased number of eligible bachelors for marriage. This scarcity led to increased competition amongst families, who offered larger dowries to secure a suitable groom for their daughters. - Marriage negotiations: Dowry acted as a bargaining tool during marriage negotiations, as it enabled families to secure favorable terms of agreement based on the financial offerings provided by the bride's side. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same because they address different aspects of life in the olden days – one focuses on the military practices and soldiers' stamina, while the other explores the cultural practice of dowry and its historical implications. Both questions require separate investigations into the respective fields of military history and social customs and traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To answer this question, we will follow the story step-by-step and identify the correct scenario based on the given instructions. 1. Jackson entered the office. 2. Evelyn entered the office. 3. The spinach is in the red_crate. 4. Evelyn exited the office. 5. Jackson moved the spinach to the red_cupboard. Now, let's analyze the scenarios: Scenario 1: The individual's belief matches reality. Scenario 2: The individual's belief does not match reality. Scenario 3: An individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. In the story, Jackson moves the spinach to the red_cupboard after Evelyn has left the office. Therefore, scenario 2 seems to be the most relevant because Evelyn's belief (the spinach is in the red_crate) does not match reality (the spinach is in the red_cupboard). However, the question asks about Jackson's belief regarding where Evelyn would search for the spinach. This falls under scenario 3. Jackson was present when the spinach was initially in the red_crate, and he moved it to the red_cupboard after Evelyn left the office. As a result, Jackson would logically assume that Evelyn would search for the spinach in its original location, which is the red_crate.

The Huronian glaciation followed after the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), a time when increased atmospheric oxygen decreased atmospheric methane. The oxygen combined with the methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which does not retain heat as well as methane does.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either.  - The St. Clair River is a river in central North America which drains Lake Huron into Lake St. Clair, forming part of the international boundary between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan.

It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair.  - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada.

The legislation has been amended many times, including \\"over twenty major changes\\" made by 2002.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in the U.S. state of Michigan, between Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac.  - In Canada, an Indian reserve is specified by the Indian Act as a \\"tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\\"  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis.  - Southwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario, centered on the city of London. It occupies most of a peninsula that is bound on three sides by water: Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay, to the north and northwest; the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River, to the west; and Lake Erie to the south. To the east, on land, Southwestern Ontario is bounded by Central Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe. The region had a population of 2,504,878 in 2011.  - Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population of 72,366. It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \\"The Rapids\\" when he had horses and men pull his barque \\"Le Griffon\\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679.  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - Georgian Bay (French: \\"Baie Georgienne\\") is a large bay of Lake Huron, located entirely within Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area .

Help as much as you can. Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things. My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Question: Why did the writer's wife leave him? Options:  A. not enough information  B. The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love.  C.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more gasses being emitted happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more gases being emitted would have a direct effect on the process of the greenhouse effect. As more gases are released into the atmosphere from various sources, the concentration of these greenhouse gases increases. This, in turn, leads to a greater ability of the atmosphere to trap heat and energy from the sun's light. Consequently, more heat is retained in the Earth's atmosphere, which amplifies the greenhouse effect and further contributes to global warming. This significant increase in greenhouse gases can have substantial impacts on the Earth's climate, leading to a range of environmental consequences."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - The is a major Japanese railway line of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group) network, connecting and Kbe stations.

Natalie hated cats while Lauradidn't so","output":"every time the two friends met up, a heated debate over the furry creatures was inevitable. Natalie could never understand why Laura was so enamored by the fickle creatures, with their sharp claws and moody attitudes. On the other hand, Laura couldn't comprehend how Natalie could resist their soft fur, clever minds, and beautiful eyes. One sunny afternoon, the two friends decided to go to the local park for a picnic. As they were preparing to find a spot under a large oak tree, Natalie let out a fake gasp and said in a sarcastic tone, \\"Look Laura, there's a stray cat. Aren't you just dying to be its best friend?\\" Step 1: Continue with the current scene. Justification: Continuing the current scene allows for further development of the situation and character relationships. Laura rolled her eyes and chuckled, \\"You know, not all cats are evil. Besides, a stray cat might need help.\\" That moment, the two noticed that the cat had indeed looked quite scruffy and malnourished. Step 2: Introduce a problem regarding the cat. Justification: Presenting a problem adds some depth to the story and can lead to character growth. Though Natalie was reluctant, they both decided to get closer to the cat to see if it needed any assistance. To their surprise, the cat approached them without hesitation and let out a weak meow. Step 3: Show the characters interacting with the problem. Justification: This provides an opportunity for the characters to display their traits and values while advancing the storyline. As Laura fished out some leftover turkey sandwich from their picnic basket, Natalie commented, \\"Fine, we can help it. But, just for today.\\" Watching the cat hungrily devour the food, even Natalie's heart softened a little. Step 4: Indicate character development. Justification: Showing change in a character's attitude adds depth and makes the story more engaging. After feeding the cat, the two friends began to discuss what to do next. Ultimately, they concluded that they couldn't just leave the cat in the park. So, they decided to take it to a nearby animal shelter to give it a chance at a better life. Step 5: Resolve the introduced problem. Justification: Resolving the problem gives the story a sense of closure and progress. Over time, Natalie's experience with the stray cat changed her perspective on cats. Although she still didn't completely understand Laura's love for them, she now hesitated less in supporting her friend when it came to helping feline friends. And while their debates about cats continued, they were no longer heated, but rather filled with playful banter and understanding.

Garden was lacking in nutrients. Once upon a time, in a quaint little town, there stood a beautiful garden, lovingly cared for by Mrs. Winston. This garden had various plants with breathtaking flowers that bloomed year-round, bringing joy and admiration from everyone who passed by. Little did they know that the garden's most beautiful and fascinating story came from a seemingly ordinary rose bush. One day, Mrs. Winston found a delicate rose withering in the garden as the soil seemed to lack the nutrients it desperately needed to survive. With a heavy heart, she dug up the rose and its roots with the utmost care, hoping that maybe it could still be saved. She transplanted the frail rose into a pot, placed it on her windowsill, and provided it with all the love and attention that her other flowers received. To her amazement, the once-withered rose began to grow heartily in the pot, regaining its vigor and sprouting vibrant new buds. It seemed that the pot's soil provided the essential nutrients needed for the rose to thrive, something the garden soil could not accomplish. As the rose continued to flourish, it not only regained its former beauty but even surpassed it. With each blooming season, it seemed to become even more enchanting, captivating the hearts of all who gazed upon it. The once lifeless flower now blossomed with delicate petals, rich with deep shades of red and an intoxicating scent that few could resist. It was a miraculous transformation, a testament to the resilience and determination inherent in nature. The rose's story quickly spread throughout the town, and curious visitors flocked to Mrs. Winston's house to witness firsthand the magical transformation. The splendid rose even earned a nickname from the locals – \\"The Resilient Rose.\\" It became a symbol of hope, strength, and perseverance, inspiring everyone who heard its tale. One day, a renowned botanist named Dr. Claire Horton came to visit the town and heard about \\"The Resilient Rose.\\" Intrigued by the story, she decided to study the rose in an attempt to uncover the secret behind its rejuvenation. After conducting numerous tests and observing the flower closely, she discovered that the pot's soil contained a unique blend of nutrients customarily absent from the garden soils in this region. These nutrients were the critical missing ingredient that allowed the rose to regain its strength and beauty. Dr. Horton proceeded to share her findings with the community, teaching them how to replicate the nurturing environment that the pot provided. Slowly but surely, gardens all around town began to integrate Dr. Horton's discoveries, transforming their soils into rich habitats for roses and many other plants. In turn, the town bloomed with newfound prosperity, becoming a haven for botanical enthusiasts and horticulturalists alike – all thanks to \\"The Resilient Rose\\" and those willing to learn from it. Through the years, \\"The Resilient Rose\\" continued to occupy its cherished spot on Mrs. Winston's windowsill. It grew into a magnificent and inspiring testament to the beauty of nature and the importance of understanding and nurturing the world in which it thrives. And as the town flourished around it, Mrs. Winston couldn't help but feel a deep sense of pride and fulfillment for having brought a once fragile and dying rose back to life, creating a symbol of hope and a lasting legacy that would be remembered for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Melbourne, Australia teenager is facing criminal charges after accessing Apple’s backend network multiple times over a year, according to Australian newspaper The Age. He apparently did this out of love, his lawyer says, because he admired the company and “dreamed of” working there. He managed to download 90GB of “secure files” and customer accounts, although it’s unclear exactly what part of the network infrastructure he accessed.      He reportedly developed multiple backdoors and evaded detection up until a raid on his parents’ home exposed a bunch of stolen files and instructions saved in a folder very obviously named “hacky hack hack.” Australian police also seized two laptops, a phone, and hard drive from the teen. He also apparently relied on some sort of software to help him inside, but again, it’s not clear what function this software served. He has pleaded guilty and is due next month for sentencing. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update if we hear back.      an obviously named file folder      This, of course, isn’t the first time hackers have been drawn to Apple data. Most infamously, hackers accessed multiple celebrities’ iCloud accounts through a phishing campaign that led to the publishing of female victims’ nude photos. It’s possible that this Australian hacker also infiltrated iCloud accounts as opposed to some deep layer of Apple’s network. More recently, the Turkish Crime Factory claimed to have stolen hundreds of millions of iCloud credentials, but ultimately was found to have just recycled already public data. It isn’t clear whether this Australian teen found a novel way in or relied on old work. ||||| Company says no data compromised by 16-year-old although court hears he stored information’ in a folder called ‘hacky hack hack’      A 16-year-old boy hacked into Apple’s mainframe, downloaded internal files and accessed customer accounts because he was a fan of the company and hoped to work there one day, a Melbourne court has heard.            According to The Age newspaper, the boy’s lawyer told the children’s court in Melbourne on Thursday that his client had hacked into the Apple network on multiple occasions over one year because he admired the company.      The boy, who studies in a private school, stored the saved information in a folder titled “hacky hack hack”, the newspaper said.      There’s ingenuity behind Apple’s great success. But we must guard against its might | Will Hutton Read more      Despite the court being told that the teenager had downloaded 90GB of secure files and accessed customer accounts, Apple – the world’s most valuable company – has denied that customers were affected.      The company said it identified the security breach and notified the FBI, which in turn referred the matter to the Australian federal police.      “At Apple, we vigilantly protect our networks and have dedicated teams of information security professionals that work to detect and respond to threats,” a company spokesman told Guardian Australia in a statement.      “In this case, our teams discovered the unauthorised access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement. We regard the data security of our users as one of our greatest responsibilities and want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised.”      The Age said customer data had been accessed, and that the boy managed to obtain customers’ authorised keys – their login access.      The AFP searched the teenager’s home last year and seized two computers. The serial numbers of the devices matched those of the devices that had accessed the internal systems, a prosecutor told the court.      The boy also shared details of his hacking with members of a WhatsApp group.      Apple would not specify to Guardian Australia what information had been accessed by the boy, or how they identified the breach.      The boy pleaded guilty and will return to the court for sentencing in September.      Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a privacy expert from from the University of Melbourne’s school of computing and information systems, urged against a punitive sentence.            “I have researched a number of teen hacker cases internationally,” Dreyfus said.      “Almost all these teens grew out of the technology boundary-pushing of their youth, and then went on to live useful lives and contributing to society. Putting them in prison is often a waste of that potential.            “Young people often make mistakes when they are exploring and rule-breaking especially online – including boasting about their exploits.

Given the background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  and the situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method.  Answer the following question: Which farmer didn't cause the predation of the crop itself?

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. \\"","output":"After weeks of protests and mounting international pressure, President Pervez Musharraf eventually lifts the state of emergency and allows the banned networks, including GEO-TV and ARY Digital, to resume operations. Freed from the restrictions, the media channels return to their regular programming, reporting on the political landscape in Pakistan, including instances of governmental misconduct and abuses of power. While the media channels appreciate their newfound freedom, they know that they must continue to hold the Musharraf government accountable and urge for reforms to prevent a recurrence of the situation. In time, these efforts contribute to political change in Pakistan, and many citizens view this period as a turning point in the country's struggle for press freedom and democracy. Ultimately, Musharraf's regime weakens, making way for a more democratic government that puts protections in place for freedom of the press and vows to prevent a similar crisis from happening again. The story ends as Pakistan moves forward on the road to increased transparency, and press freedom is championed by both the media and the nation's people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was claimed by the United Kingdom and placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1933. It is the largest territory of Antarctica claimed by any nation. In 1961, the Antarctic Treaty came into force. Article 4 deals with territorial claims, and although it does not renounce or diminish any preexisting claims to sovereignty, it also does not prejudice the position of Contracting Parties in their recognition or non-recognition of territorial sovereignty. As a result, only four other states recognise Australia's claim to sovereignty in Antarctica.  AAT consists of all the islands and territory south of 60°S and between 45°E and 160°E, except for Adélie Land (136°E to 142°E), which divides the territory into Western AAT (the larger portion) and Eastern AAT. It is bounded by Queen Maud Land in the West and by Ross Dependency in the East. The area is estimated at 5,896,500 km.  The territory is inhabited by the staff of research stations. The Australian Antarctic Division administers the area primarily by maintaining three year-round stations (Mawson, Davis and Casey), which support various research projects.  The territory is divided into nine districts, which are from West to East: These regions are split into two separate areas geographically, with George V Land and Oates Land lying to the east of the French Territorial claim of Adélie Land, and all other districts lying to its west.

While the first sentence provides valuable information about the heart of Chalki and the presence of small Byzantine chapels in the valley, it does not give an exact number of chapels like the second sentence does. The first sentence states that the heart of Chalki has a Venetian tower, which is an important landmark, demonstrating historical significance of the area. It also mentions that the valley area, in general, has a number of small Byzantine chapels. The presence of these chapels could suggest rich cultural influence and history, as well as the religious importance of the area. The use of the phrase \\"a number of\\" implies that there are multiple chapels, but it is not specific enough to determine an exact count. This phrase could mean anywhere between a few chapels to even many dozens, but does not specify \\"20 chapels\\" as stated in the second sentence. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that the first sentence entails the second. In summary, the first sentence provides descriptive information about Chalki's heart and valley, mentioning the existence of a Venetian tower and small Byzantine chapels. However, it does not offer an exact number or specifics about the number of chapels, leaving the reader unaware of the total count. The second sentence claims that there are 20 chapels in the heart of Chalki but this detail is not entailed or supported by the information provided in the first sentence.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (; nee Stephen; 25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the most important modernist twentieth century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Virginia Stephen was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London. She was the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Stephen, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, her father Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter, and four children were born in her parents' second marriage, of whom the most well known was the modernist painter, Vanessa Stephen (later Vanessa Bell). Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother's family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister.  George Duckworth also assumed some of their mother's role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage which resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virgina regarding the conventional expectations of young upper class women \\"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires - say to paint, or to write - could be taken seriously\\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \\"room of one's own\\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \\"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\\".  The death of Stella Duckworth, her pregnant surrogate mother, on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia's sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \\"1897-1904 -- the seven unhappy years\\", referring to \\"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\\". In April 1902 their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia's father's death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \\"broken chrysalis\\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf's writing but the \\"broken chrysalis\\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death, Leslie Stephen's net worth was PS15,715 6s. 6d.

Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of “a suicide bomber,” then switched centuries for his next metaphor. “The administration is like the French Revolution,” Stone said. “You never know who will be beheaded next.”      But Stone didn’t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. “As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president’s cellphone, the president’s private number. Just because he’s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.”      When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past.      From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House, way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered.      “The president thought I killed it,” Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room.      The administration is like the French Revolution. You never know who will be beheaded next. Republican strategist Roger Stone      “If you were 7 inches taller, I’d be worried,” Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president.      The euphoria wouldn’t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine.      Scoop: Trump is dining tonight w/Sean Hannnity, Bill Shine (former Fox News executive), & Anthony Scaramucci, per to 2 knowledgeable sources — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 26, 2017      Senior White House official tells me that Melania was also at the dinner tonight with Trump, Hannity, Shine, and Scaramucci. — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) July 27, 2017      Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn’t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence, who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of “The Five” on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there.      A source close to Scaramucci tells me that additionally, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the Fox News host, was there. https://t.co/vMz3lVNP5K — Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) July 27, 2017      Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as “an attack.”      Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle’s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle “are very close friends but nothing more.” He added, “He is way too short for Kimberly.”      Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she’s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are “good friends.”      As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night’s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview, published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a “paranoid schizophrenic” and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio.      Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview. “The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.”      Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer.      Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that. Anthony Scaramucci on The New Yorker interview      When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: “I’ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been ‘old family friends,’ though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that’s what he’s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.”      According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn’t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to “watch it” in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation.      I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. “I think I have strep,” he said. On top of everything else, the night before, The New York Post had broken the news of his impending divorce from his second wife, Deidre Ball.      Jonathan Ernst / Reuters White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci arrives with President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One in Ronkonkoma, New York, on Friday. On Monday, Scaramucci was out of a job.      That Scaramucci’s marriage was in trouble was hardly a secret. Long before Ball filed for divorce on July 6, Scaramucci was open with friends and associates about what he believed to be the sorry state of their union and how they were struggling through regular counseling sessions.      He just hated that his relationship was being discussed in public. A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn’t attend the birth of their son last week. Instead, he sent Ball a short congratulatory text.      Scaramucci said this is an unfair characterization of events. He told me that Ball’s due date was Aug. 9, so when he boarded Air Force One to West Virginia last Monday to attend the president’s address at the National Scout Jamboree, he didn’t think he’d be in danger of missing the birth. As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there.      As of Tuesday afternoon, he still hadn’t met his son. Scaramucci claimed that right after the birth Ball texted him her request for some space. When I asked about this text, Ball’s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: “Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.” (Jill Stone said she couldn’t comment on the rest of Scaramucci’s version of events.)      When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn’t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage. “It’s fine. I mean, what am I going to do?” He perked up when he started talking about the fantastic team he was going to bring into the White House’s communications shop and the big plans he was going to enact after a tumultuous first week.      But on Monday morning, Scaramucci knew he was cooked. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, the new chief of staff, who insisted that all White House staff report to him, asked for his resignation. “It was a very polite conversation,” Scaramucci says.      Scaramucci then went to see Trump, who was unavailable. He ended up speaking with the president, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, separately later in the day by telephone. All were gracious, he said. “The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.”      So what are you going to do next, I asked him.      “I am now going to go dark,” he said.      And then?      “Then I will reemerge.” He paused. “As me.” ||||| Anthony Scaramucci Moocho Dinero Waiting After D.C. On Public Speaking Circuit      Anthony Scaramucci Can Turn White House Debacle into 75k Speaking Engagements      EXCLUSIVE      Anthony Scaramucci's absurdly brief gig in the White House is going to pay off big-time, and help make the rich man even richer ... IF he chooses to cash in on making speeches.      Multiple sources plugged into the public speaking circuit tell us the Mooch is such a hot ticket right now, he could haul in 75,000 per event. We're told his market value as a hedge fund magnate and entrepreneur already made his speaking engagements worth roughly 25-50k -- but those 10 days in the West Wing make him a bigger draw, which means way more dough.      Our sources say the high drama around his administration stint adds extra appeal ... especially if he wanted to play the \\"sacrificial lamb.\\" However, it's doubtful Scaramucci would turn on Trump in speeches just to make a buck. He's got plenty of money, and most D.C. insiders agree loyalty to the Prez wasn't his issue.      Bottom line -- Mooch is in position to clean up, and -- as they say -- come out smelling like a rose. ||||| I received a call Monday night from Roger Stone, the infamous political prankster and Donald Trump confidant.

This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I've recently got my copy! Although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'CAPITAL CITY' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of Head Trader Wendy Foley's (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms, interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and, to most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast. In fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of Shane Longman as represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by Wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' Peter Longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy, relaxed modern way of business become a reality. To a certain degree Wendy's (I am led to believe) immediate supervisor Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for Wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions. The main interest in the series, I believe, stems from the simmering romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge's Declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired German trader Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship/fondness that they undoubted have.

Why are few people born transgender? How are transgender people born? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"At a glance, the two questions may appear to have a similar meaning, but upon closer examination, we can notice a subtle distinction between them. The first question asks why there are only a few people born transgender, while the second question inquires into how transgender people are born. Let's address each question in detail: 1) Why are few people born transgender? The underlying reason only a few people are born transgender primarily lies in the multifaceted nature of gender identity, which is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. The term \\"transgender\\" speaks to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The exact cause of being transgender is not completely understood, and it is thought to involve an interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. Research has shown that several genes play a role in the development of gender identity. Similarly, hormonal factors (especially during prenatal development) are considered vital in shaping one's gender identity. Nonetheless, the prevalence of transgender individuals is subject to the survey methods used to gather data and the societal openness to transgender issues. Up-to-date studies suggest that approximately 0.5% - 1.2% of the population identifies as transgender. It is essential to consider that many transgender individuals may remain unidentified due to factors such as social stigma, discrimination, and lack of awareness or understanding. 2) How are transgender people born? As mentioned earlier, no single cause can sufficiently explain why some people are born transgender. It is typically attributed to a combination of various genetic, hormonal, and environmental components. Here are some factors that experts believe could play a role: - Genetic factors: Studies have found a potential link between specific genes (like those involved in hormone metabolism) and the likelihood of being transgender. It is suggested that genetic predispositions might interact with other factors to impact an individual's gender identity. - Hormonal factors: Hormones such as testosterone and estrogen play a crucial role in the development of fetal sexual characteristics. In some cases, prenatal exposure to atypical hormone levels may affect the fetus's gender identity development. This theory suggests that transgender individuals may experience a mismatch between their assigned sex at birth and their gender identity due to hormonal variations during critical stages of fetal brain development. - Environmental factors: Some experts believe that the environment, both in the womb and during formative years, can influence the development of gender dysphoria (a condition in which there is a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify). These factors may include cultural and societal norms, family dynamics, and individual experiences. In conclusion, while the two questions discussed do address the same subject, they focus on different aspects of the transgender experience. The first question looks into the prevalence of transgender individuals, while the second question seeks to explain the factors involved in the development of transgender identity. Researchers are still working to uncover the various influences that shape gender identity, and our understanding of the subject continues to evolve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: Where can a person buy a snake? Options: - tropical forest - walmart - north america - feild - pet shops  Explain why a human would choose \\"pet shops\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"pet shops\\" as the answer to the question of where a person can buy a snake for several reasons: Step 1: Identify the relevant options - In the list of options provided, first, we can recognize that some options are habitats or geographic locations (tropical forest, North America, field) and some are businesses or stores (Walmart, pet shops). Step 2: Assess the likelihood in context - Since we are considering where someone could buy a snake, focus should be on the options that are more relevant to the transaction context. This means that the habitats and geographic locations are less important, as people typically do not 'buy' anything from these places. This leaves us with two choices - Walmart and pet shops. Step 3: Evaluate the options for availability and expertise - Walmart is a general merchandise store that mostly sells household items, groceries, and some electronics. It is highly unlikely that Walmart sells live snakes. On the other hand, pet shops specialize in selling various types of animals, including exotic pets like snakes. Moreover, pet shops are more likely to have knowledgeable staff who can guide buyers on how to properly care for a snake and what to expect throughout the snake's life. Step 4: Make an informed decision - Based on the evaluation, it is clear that \\"pet shops\\" is the most reasonable and appropriate answer to the question. The human chooses \\"pet shops\\" because it is a business that is specialized in selling animals, including snakes, and can also provide expert advice on how to care for them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A: Choose your answer from:  a). parallel planes;  b). sedimentary planes;  c). calcium planes;  d). cleavage planes; The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, we need to recall the different types of planes and understand which of these is related to the shape formation of minerals as they break. a) Parallel planes - These are planes that do not intersect but run alongside each other. While this may seem relevant, it doesn't provide information about how minerals break. b) Sedimentary planes - These planes are related to the deposition of sediments as they accumulate over time. As this process deals with accumulation rather than the breaking of minerals, this answer is not the right one. c) Calcium planes - Calcium is an important element for shells and some minerals, but the term \\"calcium planes\\" does not exist in the context of mineralogy. So, this answer doesn't apply to the given question. d) Cleavage planes - Minerals exhibit a property called cleavage where they break along specific planes. The planes along which minerals break are determined by their crystal structure and the arrangement of atoms. This leads to the formation of distinct shapes based on the cleavage planes in the mineral.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both ask for the opinions of Holocaust survivors on the movie Schindler's List. Now, let's address the main query. Schindler's List, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1993, is a significant film that portrays the brutal reality of the Holocaust during World War II. The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved over 1,200 Jews from the concentration camps by employing them in his factories. The film has garnered widespread acclaim and has become an important benchmark in Holocaust education. The reaction of Holocaust survivors to the film varies. Some individuals regard it as a powerful and authentic representation of the Holocaust that provides a realistic glimpse into the experiences of those who lived through its horrors. They appreciate the film for its ability to illustrate the complexities of human behavior under extreme circumstances and its efforts to maintain historical accuracy. Some survivors have expressed that the film evoked strong emotions and brought back painful memories, ultimately contributing to keeping the history alive and promoting a better understanding of the Holocaust. However, there are also Holocaust survivors who criticize the movie for various reasons. Some feel that Schindler's List takes certain dramatic liberties, with certain scenes or portrayals overemphasized to create a more engaging narrative. They argue that such embellishments can potentially distort the historical truth and oversimplify the complexities of the Holocaust. Additionally, some survivors feel that the movie focuses too much on the story of one \\"hero\\" (Oskar Schindler), detracting from the broader context and neglecting the millions of lives lost and incredible stories of resistance, resilience, and survival that went untold. In conclusion, Holocaust survivors have a range of opinions about Schindler's List, with some regarding it as an essential and powerful work of art that captures the essence of the Holocaust, while others criticize certain aspects of the film as oversimplified or historically inaccurate. Ultimately, the movie has played a significant role in raising awareness about the Holocaust and promoting discussions about its history, significance, and impact on those who lived through it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but have different characteristics. For example, cell Z is smaller than cell X. Furthermore, scientists studying the two cells have recorded that cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z.  Which cell will have more folds throughout the membrane? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, cell X will likely have more folds throughout the membrane. This is because cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z, requiring a larger surface area for efficient transport of materials into and out of the cell.

Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species.  Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo.  To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. By saying \\" but they are nothing like their wild cousins\\", the writer means that   _  . A) they are no longer feared by other wild animals B) they don't know how to hunt or kill C) a complete change has resulted in the species because of breeding D) to reintroduce them into the wild has become an urgent task Answer:","output":"B) they don't know how to hunt or kill The writer mentions that the tigers found in the cages of zoos around China \\"have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing.\\" This means that these tigers are not able to care for themselves in the wild, as they have not developed or maintained the necessary instincts and abilities to hunt and kill prey. These captive tigers are \\"nothing like their wild cousins\\" because they lack the essential skills that characterize wild tigers and facilitate their survival in their natural habitat. As a result, efforts to reintroduce these tigers into the wild, such as the program of sending young tigers to South Africa, have become crucial in order to help them regain their hunting and killing instincts and ultimately restore their population in China."},{"instruction":"Title: I hate it Review: The crutch has to button up.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We need to find the value of \\"u\\". Here's the problem: -14*u + 8*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u First, let's add the same \\"u\\" parts together on both sides. On the left side, we have -14*u and 8*u: (-14 + 8)*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u This simplifies to: -6*u - 18025 = 79*u + 90*u Now let's do the same thing on the right side, adding 79*u and 90*u: -6*u - 18025 = (79 + 90)*u This simplifies to: -6*u - 18025 = 169*u Next, let's get all the \\"u\\" parts on one side and the number parts on the other side. To do that, we can add 6*u to both sides: -6*u + 6*u - 18025 = 169*u + 6*u This simplifies to: -18025 = 175*u Now, to find the value of \\"u\\", we need to get it alone without any numbers next to it. So, let's divide both sides by 175: -18025 / 175 = 175*u / 175 This simplifies to: -103 = u So, the solution to the problem is u = -103.

Additionally, endocrine therapy is the most important treatment in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive advanced breast cancer. This study was aimed to investigate the role of AR in MBC treatment and prognosis and to analyse the relationship between AR and the effect of tamoxifen treatment in MBC patients.', 'AR protein levels and other tumour characteristics (e.g. expression of ER (ESR1), PR (PGR), AR, HER2 (ERBB2) and Ki-67 (MKI67)) in breast cancer tissue from 102 MBC patients were determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between AR status and clinicopathological features was analysed using the χ(2)-test. Association with survival was initially analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for other prognostic indicators.', 'High expression of AR was not correlated with T-stage, histological grade, HER2 status and the status of other sex hormone receptors, but was associated with lymph node metastases (P=0.032).

Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders. \\"Thousands of times a year, Idahoans are victims of domestic violence. The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services. Last year's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims. The help ranged from representation in protection order hearings to legal assistance in divorce, visitation and child support cases. The donations are tax deductible.

A secret organization, known simply as the \\"Company.\\" A:","output":"Title: The Second Chance Synopsis:  Arthur Hamilton, a 55-year-old successful businessman, has lost the passion and excitement he once had for life. His marriage is on the brink of collapse, his relationships with his adult children are strained, and he's become disillusioned with the corporate world. As he starts to question the meaning of his life and what he has accomplished, he is approached by a mysterious organization known simply as the \\"Company.\\" Plot: Act 1: The movie opens with Arthur Hamilton waking up to face another monotonous day, entirely void of inspiration and adventure. We see scenes of him at work, surrounded by subordinates who don't respect him, and then at home, where he has a disconnected, cold relationship with his wife and grown children. One evening, while returning home, a shadowy figure hands Arthur a business card with vague contact details of the \\"Company.\\" Intrigued, Arthur connects with the organization and is introduced to the enigmatic Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith reveals that the Company specializes in giving privileged individuals a second chance at life by staging their deaths, providing them new identities, and allowing them to live the lives they've always dreamed of. Skeptical but desperate for change, Arthur eventually agrees to their terms. Act 2: The Company fakes Arthur's death and gives him a new identity as \\"Michael Johnson,\\" a successful painter and world traveler. They provide him with a modern beachfront home, where he enjoys the freedom to indulge in his artistic passions and connect with like-minded people. As Michael, he even meets a local woman named Amelia, with whom he forms a deep and passionate romantic relationship. Over time, however, Arthur starts to feel uneasy about the choices he's made. He misses his grown children and eventually learns that his wife has remarried. The pain of this revelation, coupled with the guilt of leaving his old life behind and lies he has to make to Amelia, begins to trigger deep internal conflict. Act 3: Arthur reaches a breaking point and approaches Mr. Smith, asking to return to his old life. Smith responds that there's no turning back, but offers him one last opportunity for redemption: if he helps the Company complete a critical mission, he will be rewarded with a fresh start and his family's financial security. Arthur reluctantly agrees to the mission and, with the help of Amelia (now fully aware of the Company and Arthur's past life), carries out a dangerous operation to expose corruption within a rival organization. The mission is successful, but tragic consequences ensue when Amelia is killed in the process. In the end, a disillusioned Arthur returns to his old life as a changed man. He begins to rebuild his relationships with his estranged family and find ways to reconnect with the passions he discovered while living as Michael Johnson. Arthur ultimately learns that he doesn't need a secret organization to give him a second chance at life – all he needs is the courage to face his regrets and the determination to change himself for the better. In the final scene, Arthur is shown surreptitiously using the money provided by the Company to set up an art gallery in Amelia's name, as a testament to her love and a symbol of his newfound commitment to living with purpose and passion."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, creating clean air for the city's mask-wearing people. An electromagnetic field  will pull particles  in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. \\"It's like when you have a balloon which has static  and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,\\" says artist Daan Roosegaarde. His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital's parks. With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem. Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside. \\"Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.\\" \\"We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again.\\" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a practical solution to Beijing's awful air pollution. \\"This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles.\\" However, he hopes the project will make a \\"fundamental statement\\" by allowing the city's people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.

Justification: The article states that the device created by the Dutch artist and designer, Daan Roosegaarde, aims to remove pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, using an electromagnetic field to pull particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned.

As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers  drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell  along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000.   - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\"  - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners.  - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records .  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley.

Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013.  In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.  During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.  Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr.  On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what else did he propose while serving?","output":"Ronald Ernest Paul, or Ron Paul, is an important man who has done many jobs in his life. He was a doctor, a writer, and even a member of the United States Congress, which is a group of people who make important decisions for the country. He tried to become the president of the United States three times, but he didn't win. Ron didn't always agree with what the government was doing, especially when it came to how they used money and how they tried to keep the country safe. He was most known for his dislike of the Federal Reserve, which is like a big bank for the government, and how the government collected taxes from people. Over the years, Ron was in Congress a few times: first from 1976 to 1977, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. During his time there, he talked a lot about saving money and making the government smaller. He also didn't like the idea of having to sign up for the military if you didn't want to. Ron did many things while he was in Congress. He started a group called \\"the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education\\" that wanted to teach people about how the government could do better with money. He also started another group called \\"Citizens for a Sound Economy\\" with two other men named Charles and David Koch. They wanted the government to have less control, to lower taxes, and to make fewer rules for people to follow. One thing that Ron proposed while he was in Congress was to have limits on how long people could serve there. He tried to make this a rule a few times, even though he was in Congress for many years himself. In 1984, he decided to leave that job to try and become a senator, which is another important job in the government. Unfortunately, he didn't win that election, so he couldn't become a senator."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: What will a treaty be if it is in violation of a peremptory norm? Is \\"These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.\\" the correct answer? Possible answers: - yes. - no.","output":"A treaty that is in violation of a peremptory norm, also known as a jus cogens norm, would be considered void and invalid under international law. Peremptory norms represent fundamental values of the international community that are universally accepted as being of the utmost importance, such as the prohibition of genocide, slavery, and aggressive war. Consequently, they hold a higher hierarchical status than ordinary norms of customary international law, and all states must adhere to them without exception. The statement \\"These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations\\" is a correct explanation of peremptory norms. These norms cannot be contracted out of or modified by treaty agreements between states, regardless of the parties' intention or consent. This is because allowing any deviation from or violation of these norms would undermine the values and stability of international law and order.  It is important to acknowledge that if a treaty violates a peremptory norm, it will be deemed void and lacking in legal effect from the outset, as specified in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). This provision stipulates that \\"a treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law.\\" Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that the international community plays a critical role in the identification and development of peremptory norms. The formation of these norms depends on the widespread and consistent belief among states that they have a legal obligation to comply due to the significance of the values they represent. Over time, state practice and opinio juris (the belief that such practice is legally required) contribute to the establishment of peremptory norms. Once a norm reaches jus cogens status, it becomes non-derogable and binding on all states, irrespective of their individual consent. In conclusion, a treaty that is in violation of a peremptory norm will be considered void in the realm of international law. These peremptory norms represent fundamental values that all states must adhere to, with no exceptions or alterations allowed. The statement you provided is a correct explanation of peremptory norms, which, unlike other principles of customary law, permit no violations and cannot be altered through treaty obligations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She’s angry over how he’s handling the media circus around her first sit-down interview.      Sources tell us Anthony is furious that Baez has been basking in the limelight and rubbing shoulders with top TV talent, but hasn’t nailed down a big interview deal for her.      Anthony’s original attorney, Cheney Mason, will take over as her representative to the media, and sources say an announcement is imminent.      “Casey doesn’t want to be reading that Jose’s working on all of these deals on her behalf,” a source said, adding that Anthony avidly pores over online reports about herself and her camera-hogging lawyer. “She thinks he’s using her name as a meal ticket,” the source said.      Baez has been dangling a 750,000 fee for the first interview with Anthony, who’s been in hiding in Florida.      While Anthony finishes her probation, Baez has been making television appearances on her behalf and enjoying the perks of being schmoozed by network bigwigs.      “He’s going around taking meetings with TV producers and networks,” a source told us. “She doesn’t trust him anymore.”      After the video diary of Casey leaked on the Internet last week, sources tell us her inner circle grew angrier with Baez.      “They haven’t been talking for weeks,” our source said. “The video was the last straw.”      Baez threatened to sue the perpetrator of the leak in an interview with Geraldo Rivera that aired on Fox News on Sunday, stating that they were private video diaries. Yesterday, it was reported that Anthony told her probation officer that her computer had been hacked and she was upset that the clips were posted on YouTube.

Nik Lamas-Richie, founder of the website The Dirty, has offered Casey Anthony a whopping 350,000 for an interview, according to a source close to the situation.      While the big four networks have refused to pay Casey for an interview, citing the backlash of groups across the country who are threatening to boycott anyone that gives Casey money for an interview, The Dirty apparently has no qualms about shelling out big bucks for the exclusive get.

Neil had certain advantages and privileges in life that Kyle had never experienced, because  Choices: A). Neil had grown up rich.. B). Kyle had grown up rich..","output":"B). Kyle had grown up rich. Being born into a wealthy family had provided Kyle with many benefits. He had attended the best schools, had access to the finest tutors, and never had to worry about financial stability. While these privileges had certainly made life easier for him in many ways, they also presented their own set of challenges. As a result, Neil's upbringing in a more modest environment often allowed him to approach life and problems differently than Kyle. Neil, on the other hand, had grown up in a middle-class family. He had a close relationship with his parents and siblings, who all understood the value of hard work and perseverance. His parents had taught him to appreciate every opportunity he was given, especially when it came to his education. They had not been able to give Neil everything he wanted, but they had instilled in him the importance of working for what he desired. Step 1: Show the contrast between Neil and Kyle's upbringing. Despite their different backgrounds, Neil and Kyle had become friends in college. They had bonded over their shared love for sports and found that they could learn a lot from one another. Neil taught Kyle how to be more grounded and practical with his decisions, while Kyle shared his perspective on risk-taking and seizing opportunities. Step 2: Establish their friendship and how they contribute to each other's growth. One day, as they walked through the park, Kyle confided in Neil about his recent troubles at the family business. The company had been facing a financial setback, and Kyle's father had tasked him with finding a solution. Feeling overwhelmed, Kyle was unsure how to handle the situation. Step 3: Introduce a conflict that brings their different perspectives into play. Neil listened attentively and then offered some practical advice. He suggested Kyle conduct thorough research into the company's expenses, revenue, and competitors to gain a better understanding of what was causing the financial problems. Furthermore, Neil recommended that Kyle consult with his father and experienced colleagues to gather their insights and devise a plan together. Step 4: Show how Neil's upbringing influences his advice to Kyle. Kyle seemed genuinely appreciative of Neil's guidance, realizing that his initial inclination had been to throw money at the problem in hopes of a quick fix. Instead, he decided to take Neil's advice to heart and work toward a more sustainable and well-informed solution. Step 5: Demonstrate Kyle's growth and their friendship's positive influence. In the end, Kyle was able to devise a strategic plan that addressed the company's financial issues and set it on a path toward long-term stability. His friendship with Neil had not only given him valuable insights into problem-solving but also deepened his appreciation for the struggles that others faced. Neil, in turn, had learned from Kyle that sometimes taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards. The two friends continued to support and learn from one another, often referencing their contrasting upbringings as a source of strength and knowledge. Step 6: Conclude with the positive outcomes of their friendship and how their different backgrounds enriched each other's lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although you may feel that you should only take a little bit of time to mourn the death of an animal, you should also remember that it's okay to take as much time as you need to grieve over your companion. Available choices:  1). Much like mourning, time should also be not everything. Dedicate time to your grieving dog.  2). By mourning a pet, you will be able to feel grief without the need to make the decisions to deal with it. Instead, you can focus your grief on your pet.  3). Give yourself daily or weekly time to mourn the dog and make it part of your schedule. Don't expect your dog to hold you back from grieving.  4). Take a day off from school or work if you need some time work through your feelings. You might tell your supervisor or teacher, \\" my dog died. Answer:","output":"4). Take a day off from school or work if you need some time work through your feelings. You might tell your supervisor or teacher, \\" my dog died. Explanation: The correct answer is option 4 because it provides practical advice on how to cope with the death of a dog - taking time off. Other options are incorrect because: 1). This option is confusing and does not provide clear advice for a person grieving the death of a dog. 2). This option is also not providing practical advice; it simply states that mourning a pet will allow you to feel grief (which is not really helpful). 3). This option is not ideal because it suggests scheduling your grief, which is not a natural or healthy way to cope with the death of a pet.

Sentence 1: West of Alexandria, civilization gives way to empty desert except along the coast, where the late 1990s saw a building boom. This sentence suggests that civilization is scarce west of Alexandria, as it turns into an empty desert.

With this information, we can infer that some populated, developed areas exist along the coast west of Alexandria. Sentence 2: There is no civilization in Alexandria. This statement claims that there's no civilization in Alexandria, suggesting that the city is entirely unpopulated and undeveloped. However, the first sentence doesn't provide any details about the state of civilization within the city of Alexandria itself. It only discusses the areas west of the city. Given the information provided in the first sentence, we cannot determine whether the second sentence is true or not.

The local sheriff, Poe Jackson, is determined to bring the cunning killer to justice. However, the town's budget cuts have taken a toll on its resources, and Sheriff Poe Jackson must resort to using an old, out-of-shape and seemingly useless horse, named Rusty, as his means of transportation during his pursuit of the ruthless killer. Act I: Introductions and Investigation The movie begins with Sheriff Poe Jackson, a dedicated yet jaded lawman, investigating the latest in a string of grisly murders. As he examines the crime scene, it's clear that the killer leaves no trace, and the evidence is sparse. Poe's commitment to solving the case intensifies when the latest victim is revealed to be a close friend. Frustration mounts as the town's resources are minimal, with the police horses recently sold to manage budget cuts. All that remains is Rusty, an old and seemingly useless horse. Act II: The Unlikely Duo Reluctantly, Sheriff Poe Jackson teams up with Rusty, forming a peculiar crime-fighting duo. As the two embark on their quest to apprehend the killer, they face numerous obstacles – ridicule from the townspeople, Rusty's inability to maintain a reasonable pace and the ever-increasing pressure from the town mayor to solve the case. Meanwhile, the killer successfully eludes capture and continues to leave a trail of carnage in their wake. However, Poe starts to notice patterns in the murders, including the locations and times within which they occur. Slowly but surely, Poe and Rusty develop a strong bond, as Rusty's unique skills come to light, such as an extraordinary sixth sense for detecting danger and an uncanny ability to track the killer's scent. Act III: The Final Showdown With the killer seemingly one step ahead, Poe and Rusty discover the murderer's hideout, an eerie and secluded farm on the town's outskirts. As they approach, Rusty's instincts kick into high gear, and he suddenly becomes a force to be reckoned with. In a tense standoff, the killer tries to escape on a stolen dirt bike, and the stage is set for a thrilling and unconventional chase – Rusty and Poe hot on the killer's trail. Utilizing Rusty's newfound abilities, the two manage to outsmart the killer, ultimately leading to their apprehension. The town's residents, who once ridiculed Rusty, now celebrate him as a hero. The film concludes with Poe placing the handcuffed killer in the backseat of his patrol car, acknowledging that he wouldn't have succeeded in capturing the criminal without Rusty. With newfound respect, a stronger bond, and perhaps a promotion for Poe within the police force, the duo is now prepared to face any challenge that may arise in the future, proving that even the most unlikely of partnerships can lead to great success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The movie begins with Ozzy struggling to make a living as an honest man, but his past keeps catching up to him. One day, Ozzy finds himself entangled with a wealthy business mogul, Clementine Van Hooten (played by Cate Blanchett), who's desperately looking for her missing sister, Eliza. Intrigued by the case and the large reward offered, Ozzy takes on the responsibility of finding Eliza, enlisting the help of his motley crew of former criminal associates-turned-private investigators: 1. Bucky Vermillion (played by Kevin Hart), a nimble and energetic pickpocket turned tech-genius. 2. Rosalinda \\"Rosie\\" Montclair (played by Zoe Saldana), a sophisticated con-woman who now specializes in disguise and social manipulation. 3. Gideon \\"G-Man\\" Sampson (played by Dave Bautista), a man with an incredible strength and combat skills, formerly known as an enforcer in the criminal world, who now provides muscle and intimidation when necessary. As Ozzy and his team dive into the seedy underbelly of Newcrest to gather information on Eliza's disappearance, they soon realize that she was involved in something much bigger than they initially assumed: a potential corporate scandal involving illegal pharmaceutical research. Consequently, they find themselves facing off with a ruthless pharmaceutical company CEO, Sebastian Pierce (played by Tom Hiddleston), and his private security team, led by the formidable and cunning Ariana Hawke (played by Charlize Theron). With their backs against the wall, Ozzy and his team must navigate a labyrinth of lies, corruption, and advanced technological schemes in order to uncover the truth about Eliza's disappearance and bring her back home safely - all while staying one step ahead of Pierce's security forces. Throughout their journey, the team encounters various colorful characters and experiences a series of high-octane adventures - from an improbable car chase through the busy streets of Newcrest, to infiltrating a high-society masquerade ball, to clashing with a mysterious cult led by a charismatic figure known only as \\"The Alchemist\\" (played by Sir Ian McKellen). As Ozzy and his crew become increasingly more entrenched in the web of corporate deception, they begin to question their own morality, the nature of redemption, and the value of their newfound camaraderie. In their pursuit of the truth, they're forced to confront their own complicated pasts while navigating an unpredictable world driven by the overwhelming influence of wealth and power. In a grand finale filled with surprises, revelations, and clever teamwork, the team finally locates and rescues Eliza (played by Emma Stone), as well as manages to save a group of innocent victims caught in the crossfire of Pierce's nefarious experiments. United by their shared experience, Ozzy and his team decide to continue operating as private investigators, cementing their commitment to righting the wrongs that they once contributed to in their previous lives.

A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  and the situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.

Its southerly, low lying and sheltered location ensures it is among the warmer, sunnier cities in the UK. It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) since 1976.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"An oceanic climate, according to the Köppen Climate Classification system, is termed as Cfb. The term Cfb is derived from three letters C, f, and b, elaborating the major climatic conditions of the region. Let's break down what each symbol represents: 'C' represents the group of climates termed 'temperate climates'. These are regions where the average temperature of the coldest month falls between -3°C (26.6°F) and 18°C (64.4°F). The second letter, 'f', stands for 'fully humid.' In other words, these are regions that receive significant precipitation in all seasons including the warmest one and there is no dry season. Lastly, the 'b' denotes 'warm summer', implying that the average temperature of the warmest month is below 22°C (71.6°F) but at least four months have average temperatures above 10°C (50 °F).  Now, applying these interpretations to the city of Southampton mentioned in the context, its low-lying and southerly location aided by sheltered geographical status leads it to be among the sunnier, warmer cities in the UK. Still, it fits into this temperate, fully humid climate with a warm summer, given the mentioned climatic characteristics. Moreover, the oceanic climate would also explain the record held by the city for the highest temperature in the UK for the month of June since 1976, a warm but not excessively hot 35.6°C (96.1°F). This falls under the 'warm summer' categorisation without breaching into the hot summer category where the hottest month would average above 22°C (71.6°F). Worth noticing is that such climates are common in the UK, reflecting the overall influence of the Atlantic Ocean. Cities and regions with an oceanic climate are generally characterized by moderate temperature variations between seasons compared to areas with continental climates which have a larger range in temperatures. Oceanic climates can also be associated with frequent cloudy or overcast conditions, and high levels of precipitation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Six months after the events of Evolution, the government, as well as the general public, have become aware of the existence of vampires and Lycans. An initial program to study and harness their potential powers and scientific applications soon escalates into an all-out genocide. Shortly after the \\"Purge\\" begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, she is imprisoned in cryogenic suspension. After being frozen for 12 years, during which time both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape. She soon learns that another subject has also escaped the same facility, whom she initially believes to be Michael. As she makes her way through the high-tech facility, Selene sees flashes of someone else's point-of-view. Believing that Michael is mentally guiding her, she follows these \\"visions\\", which lead her down a garbage chute into a labyrinthine series of basement tunnels, where she encounters a young vampire named David, who has been tracking her. They quickly realize that the tunnels are infested with Lycans, who are hunting the subject Selene is connected with. Determined to reach Michael, Selene fights her way through the Lycan onslaught until she reaches the second escapee; not Michael, but a frightened and confused young girl named Eve. Using David's van, they start to make their way out of the facility, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David manages to shoot one while Selene stabs another; but the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle, where it bites Eve's shoulder, which triggers Eve's partial transformation, revealing her hybrid traits as she savagely rips the creature's head in half. Selene realizes that Eve is her and Michael's daughter. Eve is believed to be the key to ending the war by \\"curing\\" both the vampiric and Lycanthropic \\"infections\\". However, despite her hybrid nature, Selene soon realizes that Eve's bite wound is not healing and she is rapidly growing weaker. David agrees to take the... Answer:","output":"\\"Legacy of Nightfall: The Hunt for Salvation\\" In this thrilling sequel to Evolution, \\"Legacy of Nightfall: The Hunt for Salvation\\" chronicles the gripping journey of Selene and Michael's daughter, Eve, as they navigate through a world on the brink of extinction. Set against the backdrop of a government-initiated genocide aimed at the last remaining vampires and Lycans, Selene, Michael, and Eve must battle against all odds to create a new legacy and bring an end to a centuries-old war. In \\"Legacy of Nightfall: The Hunt for Salvation,\\" the unlikely alliance between Selene and David, a young vampire, acts as a crucial turning point as they fight their way through Lycan-infested tunnels. Upon discovering that the escapee Selene has been searching for is not her beloved Michael, but instead their daughter - a powerful hybrid named Eve - the stakes are raised even higher. As the trio embarks on a dangerous escape from the high-tech facility, they are repeatedly ambushed by Lycans. Only when Eve's hybrid traits are revealed—prompting her to savagely tear through her enemies—do they stand a chance at survival. However, the pivotal revelation that Eve may hold the key to \\"curing\\" both the vampiric and Lycanthropic \\"infections\\" heightens the tension and provides a new possibility for salvation. While Selene, David, and Eve forge an unbreakable bond, they are burdened with the knowledge that Eve's life hangs in the balance. As her body fails to heal from the Lycan attack, time races against them. If they cannot find a means to restore her wellbeing, both their family and the hope for an end to the devastating war will be lost forever. \\"Legacy of Nightfall: The Hunt for Salvation\\" promises an unforgettable cinematic experience, packed with nail-biting action, breathtaking visuals, and a heart-wrenching exploration of family, loyalty, and the pursuit of hope in the face of insurmountable odds. This epic tale serves as a worthy continuation to the Evolution saga and will leave audiences clamoring for more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Compare the two statements to identify any differences. The only difference between the two statements is the use of \\"the water bottle\\" in the first statement compared to \\"it\\" in the second statement. 3. Analyze the context of the statements. Both statements are referring to the action of taking a water bottle out of a backpack with the intention of making the water bottle easily accessible or handy. 4. Determine if the differences affect the meaning of the statements. The use of \\"the water bottle\\" in the first statement and \\"it\\" in the second statement does not change the overall meaning of the statement.

Passage:Born in the Christchurch suburb of Fendalton on 19 October 1925, Gould came from a well-connected Canterbury family. His father was Derrick William Joseph Gould, a prominent businessman, racehorse owner and captain of the New Zealand polo team, and his mother was Elisabeth Mary Gould (nėe Elworthy). His paternal grandfather was George Gould, whose father, also called George Gould, was one of the founders in 1851 of the financial agents Gould Beaumont and Company that in 1919 amalgamated with two other firms to become Pyne Gould Guinness, one of New Zealand's largest stock and station agents. Other notable relatives on his father's side of the family include his father's cousin, the historian George Macdonald, and former British Labour MP Bryan Gould, who is a descendant of the elder George Gould. David's mother was a granddaughter of both Churchill Julius, the first Anglican Archbishop of New Zealand, and Edward Elworthy, an important landowner in South Canterbury. She was thus a first cousin of Charles Elworthy, Baron Elworthy, and niece of Sir George Julius and Awdry Julius. Solution:","output":"a.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Answer:","output":"May Pang"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ban of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes is a way the government tries to fight against \\"black money.\\" Black money is the money people make through illegal activities or don't pay taxes on. By banning these notes, the government forces everyone to exchange their old notes for new ones. During this exchange, people with lots of black money might get caught, and the government can collect more taxes. The effect of destroying notes, including both white money (legal money) and black money, can cause problems for people since they need money for their daily activities. The government would replace them with new notes to help those with white money continue their normal life. 2. Micromax Vdeo 2 is a smartphone made by a company called Micromax.

TSA Spends Millions on Body Scanners, Sparking Competition Among Suppliers Despite the firestorm of controversy over the use of high-tech body scanners at airports, the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Transportation Security Administration is spending or looking to spend on them makes it unlikely that they'll be getting shelved anytime soon. Each scanner costs about 130,000 to 170,000, the agency said, and President Obama's budget request for this year calls for 88 million to buy and install 500 new scanners. The TSA already has already spent 80 million on body scanners, including 73 million received in stimulus funds. Needless to say, the technology is big business, and the two companies that supply the scanners to the TSA, L-3 Communications and Rapiscan Systems, have a record of using high-powered political operatives and lobbyists to influence lawmakers. A number of other companies also are vying for future government contracts. \\"TSA competitively bids technologies and makes selections through a comprehensive research, testing, and deployment process,\\" the agency said in a written statement. \\"Technologies must meet detection standards and TSA tests these technologies in both laboratory and field environments.\\" \\"As companies develop new and emerging technologies, they can be included in the competitive process,\\" the agency said. L-3 Communications, which has sold 39.7 million worth of machines to the TSA, has spent 4.3 million on lobbying the federal government thus far this year, though it is not clear how much of that money was spent on lobbying the TSA. Among the key figures lobbying on L-3's behalf is Linda Daschle, wife of former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat. Rapiscan, which has sold 41.2 million worth of body scanners to the TSA, has spent 221,500 on lobbying the federal government. Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff worked briefly last year as a consultant for Rapiscan, but the company said the work was unrelated to the federal government. \\"Mr. Chertoff and his staff of experts provided Rapiscan with advice and analysis with respect to a limited set of well-defined subjects unrelated to aviation security,\\" Peter Kant, executive vice president of the company, said in a written statement. \\"Chertoff Group's activities in that engagement were advisory, and neither Mr. Chertoff nor his staff has ever represented Rapiscan in any communication with the U.S. government.\\" An official with L-3 Communications told FoxNews.com that the company reported nearly 16 billion in revenues in 2009 and that most of its lobbying money is spent on defense and service branches. The official said that any company certified to sell body scanners to TSA goes through a two-year process of having the machines tested in a laboratory and a pilot program before they are accepted. L-3 Communications began its contract with TSA nearly a year ago. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying expenditures on Capitol Hill, said it's common for these companies that have or hope to have contracts with the government to invest in lobbying that can lead to \\"make or break moments.\\" \\"In this case, 4.3 million is an enormous amount of money but a small price to pay for the potential profits they could reap,\\" she said, adding that without the money, companies may not be able to make their case \\"forcefully enough.\\" \\"From our perspective, we want to put a spotlight on the money,\\" she said. \\"It's big bucks, big business. Where it has an impact on policy decisions, we need public oversight. We need the public to take the time to understand the players involved, the money involved and what the outcome is involved.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is spending millions of dollars on high-tech body scanners for airports and is looking to spend even more, making them unlikely to be discontinued. 2. Each scanner costs around 130,000 to 170,000 and President Obama's budget request for this year calls for 88 million to buy and install 500 new scanners. The TSA has already spent 80 million on body scanners, including 73 million received in stimulus funds. 3. The technology is big business, and the two primary companies supplying the scanners to the TSA, L-3 Communications and Rapiscan Systems, have a history of using high-powered political operatives and lobbyists to influence lawmakers. 4. Other companies are also vying for future government contracts, and the TSA is open to including new and emerging technologies in the competitive process. 5. Lobbying expenditures by companies with government contracts, such as L-3 Communications and Rapiscan, highlight the need for public oversight and understanding of the players and money involved in the decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Egyptian Archaeological Mission working at... (Associated Press)      SAQQARA, Egypt (AP) — Egypt on Saturday announced the discovery of a private tomb belonging to a senior official from the 5th dynasty of the pharaohs, which ruled roughly 4,400 years ago.      Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani announced the find at the site of the tomb in Saqqara, just west of Cairo, which is also home to the famed Step Pyramid.      He said drawings on the tomb's walls were \\"exceptionally well-preserved.\\" The drawings depicted the official and his family, he added.      The tomb also contained a total of 45 statues carved in rock. Again, they depict the official and his family.      In recent years, Egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in the hope of attracting more tourists to the country. The vital tourism sector has suffered from the years of political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. ||||| A 4,400-year-old tomb constructed for a \\"divine inspector\\" named \\"Wahtye\\" and holding at least 55 statues has been discovered at Saqqara in Egypt, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced this morning (Dec 15).      The tomb is \\"exceptionally well preserved and [colorful] with sculptures inside,\\" Egyptian antiquities minister Khaled El-Enany said at the press conference. Beneath the tomb, archaeologists found five hidden shafts, one of which, they said, could hold Wahtye's sarcophagus.      Wahtye was a high-ranking priest who carried the title of divine inspector, said Mostafa Waziri, the general secretary of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities who led the Egyptian team that discovered the tomb. Wahtye worked for a pharaoh named Neferirkare (reign ca. 2446–2438 B.C.), Waziri said. [See Photos of the Divine Inspector's Tomb at Saqqara]      Neferirkare's pyramid is about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) north of Saqqara at a site called Abusir.      The tomb contains two levels with 24 statues on the upper level and 31 statues on the lower level, Waziri said. Most, if not all, of the statues, show humans or deities, with some appearing life-size and others appearing to be less than about 3 feet (1 meter) tall.      The hieroglyphs discovered in the tomb often mention Wahtye's mother \\"Merit Meen,\\" a name that means \\"the lover of the god Min, the god of fertility in ancient times,\\" Waziri said. The hieroglyphs also mention Wahtye's wife \\"Nin Winit Ptah,\\" a name that means \\"the greatest of the god Ptah,\\" Waziri said. Ptah was a creator god associated with Memphis, an ancient Egyptian capital near Saqqara.      This painting found in the tomb also appears to show Wahtye and his wife Nin Winit Ptah Credit: Photo courtesy Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities      The tomb also contains numerous paintings, their colors still preserved despite the passage of millennia of time. The paintings show Egyptians engaged in a variety of activities, including cooking, drinking and construction work. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian General's Tomb Discovered in Saqqara]      The team will start excavating the five shafts on Dec. 17, said Waziri, adding that he believes one of the shafts will lead to the sarcophagus of Wahtye and artifacts buried with him.      Several other discoveries have been made this year at Saqqara. They include a 3,300-year-old tomb of a high general, a burial ground containing a 2,500-year-old mummy wearing a silver face mask gilded with gold and a tomb complex that has over 100 cat statues.      Originally published on Live Science. ||||| SAQQARA, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt unveiled a well-preserved 4,400-year-old tomb decorated with hieroglyphs and statues south of Cairo on Saturday, and officials expect more discoveries when archaeologists excavate the site further in coming months.      The tomb was found in a buried ridge at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the find as “one of a kind in the last decades”.      The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.      Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside, Waziri said. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, but the other four were sealed. They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday, he said. He was hopeful about one shaft in particular.      “I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area,” he said, pointing at one of the sealed shafts. “This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb.”      The tomb is 10 metres (33 ft) long, three metres (9.8 ft) wide and just under three metres high, Waziri said.      The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs. Waziri said the tomb was unique because of the statues and its near perfect condition.      “The colour is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,” he said.      The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered. Waziri said he expects more discoveries to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January.      The Fifth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about 2,500 BC to 2,350 BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built.      Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.      Slideshow (14 Images)      Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.      Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries this year.      The country hopes the finds will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travelers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who fled after the 2011 political uprising. ||||| After More Than 4,000 Years, Vibrant Egyptian Tomb Sees The Light Of Day      Enlarge this image toggle caption KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images      More than four millennia after being chiseled by Egyptian artisans, the intricate hieroglyphics and stone carvings of an ancient tomb have been uncovered.

Photographs of the tomb show a narrow doorway leading to a rectangular room, its walls covered with carved symbols, images and human forms.

A: Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the offerings at the Muthappan Temple, located in Kerala, India, do take on a unique form. Unlike the traditional Hindu offerings of fruits, flowers, or sweets, the offerings at this temple are indeed distinctive - bronze dog figurines.  The Muthappan Temple is dedicated to Lord Muthappan, a Hindu deity local to Kerala, portrayed as a hunter. According to popular folklore and legends associated with the temple, Lord Muthappan has two canine companions that assist him during his hunts. These dogs are considered to be the Lord's companions or aide in his hunting endeavours, which signifies Lord Muthappan's deep connection to nature. As a result, dogs have become symbols of Lord Muthappan and are regarded with immense respect and endearment in the shrine.  Devotees who come to worship at the Muthappan Temple, therefore, bring bronze dog figurines as offerings as a sign of reverence towards the deity and his canine companions. These figurines also serve as an emblem of the devotees' faith and loyalty, much like the loyalty symbolized by dogs. In this way, the bronze dog figurines, which are considered an unusual offering as compared to other Hindu temples, add to the unique attribution to the Muthappan Temple. Moreover, within the temple premises, one can often see real dogs roaming freely. They are well-taken care of by temple authorities, reflecting the communal role in respecting and protecting nature and animals, as epitomized by Lord Muthappan's lore. Thus, the practice of presenting bronze dog figurines as offerings at the Muthappan Temple is deeply ingrained with the mythology of the deity, the regional culture, and the community's collective sense of reverence towards nature and animals.  In conclusion, the question is correctly answered – the offerings at Muthappan Temple shrine are in the form of bronze dog figurines. Along with this, it is crucial to understand the cultural and religious significance that these figurines represent, which is unique to the Muthappan Temple and its devotees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As their ship returns to the US after a long voyage, they see all the other sailors being mistreated by their wives and girlfriends, and the two friends pledge never to get involved with women again. Unfortunately, this vow is tested almost immediately. First, Ace is confronted by the family of a former lover, Cherry, who insist he marry her. Then Josh, who is the son of rich shipping magnate, has to fend off his fiancee, Gloria, and his father's wishes that he settle down and take over the family business. Things get worse when Josh and Ace get caught up fishing and turn up late for a party to celebrate Josh's engagement. Gloria's hostile drunken brother starts a fistfight and a news reporter takes photographs that cause a scandal. Josh and Ace flee to Hawaii and then head for Singapore. However, the pair only get as far as the island of Kaigoon before their money runs out. They rescue Mima, an exotic local (but not native) from her abusive dance-partner, Caesar, and she moves into their hut. Soon Mima is running the two men's lives, much to their chagrin. The trio try to make money in several different ways, including trying to sell a spot remover that is so bad it dissolves clothes. When Josh's father finally locates his wayward son, he and Gloria fly out to bring Josh back to face his responsibilities. The resentful Caesar leads them to where Ace, Josh and Mima are enjoying a local feast. By this point, both Josh and Ace have fallen in love with Mima. She is heartbroken to learn that Gloria is Josh's fiancee. Ace proposes to Mima, but before she can accept, Josh returns. The two friends almost come to blows over Mima, but then decide that she should choose between them. Mima picks Ace. Josh boards an ocean liner with Gloria and his father. A:","output":"The first names of the people who rescue the exotic local, Mima, from her abusive dance partner, Caesar, are Josh and Ace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Larry Wilson (McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers mismatched payments. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him. When Larry and Richard arrive at the beach house, they find their boss's body. Before they can call the police, however, guests arrive for a party that is a regular event at Bernie's house every weekend. To Larry's and Richard's amazement, the guests are all too engrossed in their partying to notice their host is deceased, with Bernie's dark sunglasses and dopey grin from the fatal injection concealing his lifeless state.Fearing implication in Bernie's death, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd.

Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.

Luckily, it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television, and the bad evolution of most direct cinema. Really, at first, we must say that this isn't really direct cinema, it is more cinema verité. The difference between the two is very slight, but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary, we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers, and they do interact with the characters filmed. This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. The Meysels have been allowed in the house, and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed. It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews. Here, we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house, a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith. Their house is a mess, litter and animals everywhere, faded colors and furniture all over the house, and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. These two people have lived with each other their whole life, and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention, but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way. They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. In the end, though, even as they blame each other for their lives, they really love each other deeply. Edie says she doesn't want her mother to die, because she loves her very much, and Edith says that she doesn't want Edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone. But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age, the two women can't help be girls. They cannot help being one the singer, the other the dancer. Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically \\"Where have you been all my life?\\" she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the Meysels and few others could do.

Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway.

News article: Google's I/O Is a Bit Like DisneyLand, and a Bit Like a Garage Sale This essay originally appeared in Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter. Sign up here. There are a number of places where geeks like to congregate and spend time with their own people. Star Trek conventions, for example. But if you’re a certain kind of nerd, one of the invitations you most want to get is to Google’s I/O, the annual developer conference where the web giant talks about all of the cool new things it is working on. Arguably the pinnacle of I/O experiences happened in 2012, when four skydivers in wingsuits jumped out of a blimp wearing Google Glass headsets, and live-streamed their descent to the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The latest version of the conference wasn’t quite that exciting, but it was a great example of how Google goog continues to simultaneously be one of the most interesting and also one of the most frustrating companies out there. On the interesting side, Google announced a competitor to Amazon’s popular Echo home-automation hub called Google Home, which lets you search the web and play music by simply saying “OK, Google.” Yes, something with a human name like Alexa or Siri might have been a bit more interesting, but hey, this is Google we’re talking about. Google also announced a couple of innovations designed to improve the lives of smartphone users (and boost Google’s market position). One is a smarter version of Google Now called Assistant, and the other is Android Instant Apps, which allows users to access certain features of mobile apps without having to install them. And on the frustrating side? Well, to take just one example, the company announced a new messaging app called Allo, and a new video-calling app called Duo. But doesn’t Google already have a couple of messaging apps? Yup. There’s Messenger and Hangouts. And doesn’t one of them do video calling? It sure does. So why do we need new ones? A good question, and one that wasn’t really answered at I/O as far as we could tell. There’s arguably no other company doing as many cool things on the web and mobile as Google. And yet there’s also probably no other company that shoves as many half-baked things out the door that will inevitably wind up being mothballed. Experimentation is good, but it can be frustrating as heck. On the upside though, all we have to do is wait until next year’s Google I/O, when we’ll get a bunch more cool new apps! What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is talking about an event called Google's I/O, where the big company Google shows off cool new things they're working on.

A:","output":"A: The 1972 skating competition that included a skater who went on to win in the 1976 Winter Olympics was the 1972 World Figure Skating Championships held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, from March 6th to 12th. This event showcased several skaters who would later compete in the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. One notable skater in that 1972 competition was Dorothy Hamill, an American figure skater. Hamill was only 16 years old at the time and finished in the 7th position in the ladies' singles event. She was renowned for her unique combination of athleticism and grace and her trademark haircut—the \\"Hamill Wedge.\\" In the years to come, Dorothy Hamill would go on to develop her skills, becoming the United States Champion in 1974, 1975, and 1976. At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, Dorothy Hamill competed in the ladies' singles event, and she gave a breathtaking performance that earned her a gold medal.

Following her Olympic success, Hamill also claimed the title of 1976 World Champion in Goteborg, Sweden, and shortly after, she turned professional to have a decorated career in figure skating shows and competitions. In addition to Hamill, the 1972 World Figure Skating Championships also featured other notable skaters like John Curry from the United Kingdom, who won a gold medal in men's singles at the 1976 Winter Olympics, and Irina Rodnina from the Soviet Union, who won the pairs event along with her partner, Alexander Zaitsev, at the same Olympics.

Solve this instance: Article: Baroness Thatcher, Britain's greatest post-war prime minister, died at the age of 87 after suffering a stroke (a disease related to blood vessels in the brain), her family announced on 8 April 2013. Her son, Sir Mark, and daughter Carol confirmed her death that morning. zxxk Margaret Thatcher, daughter of a businessman and mayor of Grantham, was educated at the local grammar school, and at Oxford, where she got a degree in chemistry, and upon graduation she worked for four years as a research chemist. She then qualified as a lawyer in 1954. As Miss Margaret Roberts, she stood twice in parliamentary   elections for the Conservative Party  , before being elected (after her marriage) to the House of Commons in 1959. When the Conservatives returned to office in June 1970, she was appointed secretary of state for education and science. After the Conservatives lost power in 1974, she was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet  , and was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. Baroness Thatcher became prime minister on 4 May 1979 and went on to earn the nickname \\"the Iron Lady\\", becoming known for her strong responses to the political and economic crisis, which Thatcher's supporters think are good for Britain, while her opposers argue that her policies destroyed British manufacturing. Lady Thatcher governed Britain from 1979 to 1990. She will go down in history not only as Britain's first female prime minister, but as the woman who changed Britain's economy in addition to being an awesome rival on the international stage. zxxk Lady Thatcher was the only British prime minister to leave behind a set of ideas about the role of the state which other leaders and nations try to copy and apply.

Title: Priest Movie plot: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar.

Repeat this process with another pair of zip ties. These connected pairs will serve as the base of the phone holder, with each pair acting as a support for the top and bottom of the phone. Step 3: Create the side loops Take two more zip ties and loop them through the connected zip ties from step 2, so that they are positioned vertically on either side of the base pairs. Make sure the vertical zip ties are parallel to each other and spaced apart according to the width of your phone. Step 4: Connect the side loops Now, loop another zip tie through the top end of the two vertically positioned zip ties, connecting them together. Do the same for the bottom end of the two vertically positioned zip ties. Once connected, these zip ties will create loops on either side of the holder, which will secure the phone in place when inserted. Step 5: Secure the holder to an object At this point, you have a zip tie holder with four loops (top, bottom, left, and right). Attach the holder to your chosen sturdy object by looping a final zip tie through the object and around the back of the vertical zip ties that form the left and right loops. Tighten the zip tie securely to hold your phone holder in place. Step 6: Insert your phone Place your phone into the holder by sliding it between the top and bottom loops, allowing it to rest on the base made by the connected zip tie pairs. Step 7: Trim excess material Using scissors or wire cutters, carefully trim any excess zip tie material to create a cleaner, more polished appearance. By following these steps, you will have created a functional zip tie phone holder that can be easily attached to a sturdy object and hold your phone securely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator?  (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy...

Question: Process:  - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more drier conditions happens, how will it affect animals will have much less to eat.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The proposed perturbation of drier conditions would have a significant effect on the forest fire process, as well as both direct and indirect effects on the animals' access to food resources. Let us discuss these effects step by step. 1. Drier conditions increasing the intensity and extent of forest fires: Drier weather leads to less moisture content in the air and soil, which further increases the dryness and flammability of the trees, plants, and other organic matter on the forest floor. This would result in more intense and widespread forest fires, consuming a larger area of the forest and potentially affecting a wider range of habitats and species. 2. Direct effect of the perturbation on the animals' food availability: With a more extensive forest fire, a larger proportion of plants and trees that provide food for forest-dwelling animals would be destroyed. This would directly reduce the available food supply for the animals. Species that feed on specific vegetation may face an acute shortage of their primary food source, affecting their health, reproduction, and survival. 3. Indirect effect on animal populations in the aftermath of the fire: Apart from the immediate destruction of food resources, drier conditions could have long-lasting indirect effects on the recovery of the ecosystem and the reestablishment of food sources for animals. The regrowth of vegetation after a forest fire can be slower under drier conditions, as the soil may not receive enough moisture to support rapid plant growth. This slow recovery process would mean that animal populations would also take longer to bounce back after a fire, as they rely on the regrowth of vegetation for food and shelter. 4. Effects on predators and prey relationships: With the decline in food resources for various species, there might be increased competition among animals for the limited available food. This could alter the predator-prey dynamics in the ecosystem. Smaller animals may face increased predation risk as larger predators struggle to find sufficient food. In severe cases, predators might need to expand their range in search of alternative food sources, which could lead to changes in the distribution of species within the ecosystem. 5. The possibility of a decline in animal populations: As a result of the direct and indirect effects of drier conditions on food resources, it is likely that animal populations in the affected area would decline after a more extensive forest fire. This decline could be more pronounced among species that have specific dietary requirements or specialized habitats. Additionally, smaller populations may make it more difficult for some animal species to find mates, reproduce, and maintain a stable population size. In summary, the proposed perturbation of drier conditions can have both direct and indirect effects on the food resources available to wildlife after a forest fire. These effects include a more intense and widespread fire, destruction of food sources, slow recovery of vegetation, altered predator-prey relationships, and potential decline in animal populations. Therefore, the statement \\"animals will have much less to eat\\" under drier conditions after forest fires is accurate and highly plausible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - Lake Christabel is a small lake in the north of New Zealand's South Island. It is located 12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass. The lake is the source of the Grey River, one of the longest rivers on the South Island's West Coast, although its outlet is underground. The lake lies behind a landslide dam, thought to have been created by a prehistoric earthquake.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Lake Brunner is the largest lake in the northwestern South Island of New Zealand , covering an area of 40 km² . The lake 's outflow is the Arnold River , a tributary of the Grey River . The lake lies 31 kilometres to the southeast of Greymouth . The main settlement close to the lake is Moana , on the northern shore . Located several kilometres inland from the coast road ( State Highway 6 ) , it is less frequently visited by tourists than many of the West Coast 's scenic highlights , but it is becoming increasingly popular , in part due to its reputation for fishing . Lake Brunner was named by John Rochfort for the 19th century explorer Thomas Brunner . The Mori name for the lake , Kotuku moana , means \`\` Sea of herons '' . The New Zealand freshwater mussel ( Hyridella menziesi ) is found in the lake . By 1976 twenty percent of the catchment of the lake was farmed and there was a population of 84 at the settlement of Moana .  - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate.  - The Grey River / Mwheranui is located in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in Lake Christabel, one of numerous small lakes on the western side of the Southern Alps,12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass, and runs westward for 120 kilometres before draining into the Tasman Sea at Greymouth. The river was named by explorer Thomas Brunner in honour of New Zealand politician Sir George Grey. The official name of the river was changed to Grey River / Mwheranui in 1998 by way of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The Maori name for the river system and surrounding area is Mwhera, with Mwheranui being distinguished from the northern branch Little Grey River / Mwheraiti.  - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

We have this equation: 30*a - 4*a = -52 Now, imagine you have 30 apples (that's a lot, right?) and you give 4 apples to a friend. How many apples do you have left? That's right, you'd have 26 apples!

We want to find out how many friends you have to share with (that's our \\"a\\" value) if each of them loses 52 apples as a result. So, how many times does 26 go into -52? That's right, it goes in -2 times! So, we have: a = -2 That means, to share your 26 apples evenly, you would have to \\"unshare\\" it with 2 friends, taking 26 apples from each one.

However, learning came fairly easy for me. I was the best in most of my classes, but PE class was my nightmare   and made me feel that I was not as good as the others. Miss Forsythe was our PE teacher. She was young and energetic. Everyone liked her. She said that we all had to come to her classes. No one could hide from Miss Forsythe! One day she told me that she wanted me to play a game with another girl in a PE show. I was rather worried that I wouldn't do a good job when she explained her idea, but she was excited. With her encouragement, I had no choice but to agree. It was a \\"boy meets girl\\" game. I played the boy and my classmate, Margaret Ann, played the girl. We were dressed in evening clothes and danced around the floor. According to Miss Forsythe, I had to pick up Margaret Ann when we finished the dance. Since I was not strong enough to pick the tallest girl up, it was she who picked me up. I suddenly felt ten feet tall! It was a huge success and everybody applauded   for our excellent performance. What a wonderful ending! Afterwards, I smiled confidently  . Miss Forsythe's understanding and willingness to create a place for me in her show (which certainly did not need me) gave me some much needed confidence.

In addition, we order kid's meals at the beginning of our order; which come with a drink, but the drinks were not delivered until the main meal and they were 2/3 of the way full AND each time the waitress got refills on these (two other times), they were always delivered 2/3 of the way full...I thought it really strange why the waitress did not take the extra initiative to fill the drinks the entire way on a dinky little child size cup.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Be aware that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for consistent information. Put it in writing. Do not agree to accept only rare forms of payment. Do not submit additional work before compensation.","output":"Title: Staying Vigilant: Identifying Scams and Ensuring a Secure Transaction Introduction In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, it is crucial to remain vigilant and adopt a critical approach towards any transaction or offer that we come across. Not only does this protect us financially, but it also ensures peace of mind. If an offer appears too good to be true, the odds are it probably is. This article aims to provide guidance on identifying potential scams and ensuring a secure transaction by highlighting the importance of seeking consistent information, putting agreements in writing, avoiding unusual payment methods, and not providing additional work without prior compensation. 1. Look for Consistent Information Consistency is an essential aspect when assessing the credibility of any form of communication or transaction. Scammers often provide inconsistent or vague details to confuse their targets and escape culpability. Conduct thorough research to confirm the authenticity of the sender or the party you are dealing with. Cross-check their claims with publicly available information by looking up their company website, social media accounts, or any customer reviews and testimonials. Be cautious of exaggerated claims, manipulated data, or non-existent credentials. 2. Put it in Writing A robust and legally binding written agreement serves as a reliable safeguard against scammers. Ensure that the terms and conditions of your transaction or relationship are clearly stated in a document both parties sign. This reduces the chances of encountering fraudulent activities as scammers usually avoid legal documentation. Additionally, having everything in writing allows you to revert to the agreement if disputes arise, making it significantly easier to resolve any issues. 3. Do Not Agree to Accept Only Rare Forms of Payment Another red flag in identifying scams is the insistence on utilizing unconventional and untraceable payment methods. Be wary of any party that demands payment in cryptocurrencies, gift cards, wire transfers, or any form of payment that may be difficult to trace or recover. Scammers prefer such payment methods as they allow them to remain anonymous and disappear with your money with little chance of being held accountable. Stick with widely accepted forms of payment, such as direct bank transfers, credit cards, or well-established payment platforms like PayPal. 4. Do Not Submit Additional Work Before Compensation In various industries, whether business services, freelance work or online retail, scammers may request additional work or merchandise with the promise of increased payment or future opportunities. Avoid falling into this trap by insisting on being compensated for the initial work or product before offering any additional services or goods. By doing so, you protect your time, resources, and potential income from being exploited. Establish clear communication and agreements regarding payment schedules and terms from the outset to minimize misunderstandings and misrepresentations. Conclusion Although scammers employ increasingly sophisticated methods to deceive their targets, being proactive and vigilant can help protect one's interests and ensure a secure transaction. By paying attention to consistent information, maintaining a legally binding written agreement, avoiding unusual payment methods, and insisting on timely compensation, individuals and businesses can navigate the modern world with a greater sense of security and confidence. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts and stay vigilant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Devil and Daniel Mouse Context: The story is about two struggling mouse musicians, Daniel and Jan. When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music.

Write an article with the title: \\"This is how jittery financial markets are, in one chart\\"","output":"Title: \\"This is How Jittery Financial Markets Are, in One Chart\\" Introduction: Financial markets are known for being volatile and unpredictable. These constant fluctuations can make even the savviest investor feel uneasy. To understand the magnitude of jitteriness in today's markets, we've prepared a chart that showcases market volatility in a single, comprehensive visual representation. This article will explore the factors contributing to the jitters and analyze the implications for investors. Step 1: Choose a representation for jitteriness in financial markets For the purpose of our analysis, we have decided to use the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) as a proxy for financial market jitteriness. The VIX index, often referred to as the 'fear index,' measures the level of expected volatility over the next 30 days for the S&P 500 Index. Step 2: Gather historical data on the VIX index To provide a snapshot of how markets have been trembling in recent times, we have gathered historical VIX data to observe fluctuations over the years. This dataset enables a comprehensive understanding of times when markets were more jittery and when they were comparatively stable. Step 3: Create a visually appealing chart depicting VIX trends We have created a multi-year line chart that displays daily VIX data. The peaks and valleys of this chart represent periods of heightened fear and complacency, respectively. The selected format is simple yet powerful, allowing readers to grasp jitteriness in financial markets quickly. Step 4: Analyze the chart and identify notable periods of market jitteriness Upon analyzing the chart, we can observe multiple notable periods of market jitteriness: - The Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 showed a significant spike in the VIX, reaching its all-time high. - In 2011, concerns over the European debt crisis and a downgrade of the United States' credit rating resulted in elevated levels of market volatility. - Short-lived but intense spikes occurred in 2015 and 2018, illustrating the growing sensitivity of markets to geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Step 5: Discuss implications and strategies for investors Jittery financial markets can both present difficulties and uncover opportunities for investors. On one hand, market volatility can lead to investment losses and increased uncertainty, making it challenging to make informed decisions. On the other hand, volatility may open up opportunities for savvy investors to take advantage of price discrepancies. Based on the chart and analysis, some recommendations for investors to navigate jittery markets include: 1. Diversifying investments to minimize risk exposure. 2. Employing a long-term investment strategy to mute the impact of short-term volatility. 3. Remaining well-informed about global economic events and market trends. 4. Always having a contingency plan in place during periods of heightened market turbulence. Conclusion: By examining the VIX index in a single chart, we can effectively gauge the jitteriness of financial markets. This powerful visual representation serves as a helpful reminder that markets have experienced and weathered volatility in the past. As investors navigate the ups and downs of today's unpredictable markets, resilience, diversification, and careful planning are key to mitigating risk and capitalizing on opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia.  \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered.  and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Please answer this question : Which city will need to change its method of electricity production later? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Nillmar, the city in France that relies on coal as its main source of electricity, will need to change its method of electricity production later. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: 1. Fossil fuels, like coal, are limited resources and may eventually run out. This puts Nillmar at risk of losing its primary source of electricity in the future. 2. The burning of coal for electricity generation causes air pollution, acid rain, and contributes to global warming. These environmental problems may lead to regulatory changes or public pressure pushing Nillmar to adopt cleaner energy production methods. Springfield, the city in the United States that uses nuclear power, has a less urgent need for change. While radioactive elements used in nuclear fission are also limited and relatively rare, nuclear power does not produce air pollution or other environmental problems like burning fossil fuels does. This gives Springfield a significant advantage in terms of environmental impact and sustainability. However, both cities may eventually have to explore alternative energy options as their current resources may run out. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, can offer sustainable solutions to meet future electricity demands and reduce reliance on limited resources like coal and radioactive elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the statement \\"Malian musical traditions are derived from the griots, who are known as 'Keepers of Memories'.\\" does not contain the correct answer to the question \\"What type of garment or accessory is traditionally worn at some of the dances held?\\" The statement is about the origins of Malian musical traditions and does not provide information about garments or accessories worn during their dances. To answer the question, we need to delve into the traditional dance and clothing customs of Mali. Mali is a diverse and culturally rich country in West Africa, with various ethnic groups, each with their unique traditional dances, garments, and accessories. In Malian traditional dances, some common garments and accessories include boubous, grand boubous, and pagne clothing items. Closely tied to their cultural identity, these textiles and garments are beautifully crafted with intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and artistic designs. Here is a brief description of the traditional Malian garments and accessories mentioned above: 1. Boubou: A boubou is a loose-fitting, flowing garment typically worn by both men and women in western Africa. It is often made of hand-dyed fabric and can be adorned with elaborate embroidery. In Mali, boubous are worn by dancers during cultural events, ceremonies, and performances. 2. Grand boubou: A grand boubou is a variation of the boubou, but it is more formal and often worn by people of higher social status. This floor-length garment features a wide, flowing cut and beautiful details such as embroidery and beadwork. It is worn at special occasions, including traditional dances and ceremonies. 3. Pagne: Pagne is a large, rectangular piece of fabric that can be wrapped and draped around the body in different ways. It is a versatile piece of clothing that can be used as a skirt, dress, or wrap, depending on personal preference and regional customs. Pagne clothes are often brightly colored and feature beautiful patterns, adding a festive touch to the traditional dances. In summary, the statement about Malian musical traditions and griots does not explicitly answer the question about traditional garments or accessories worn at dances. However, by examining Malian culture, one can learn about the different types of garments and accessories, such as boubous, grand boubous, and pagne, traditionally worn at dances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Three Little Bops Movie plot: The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate...

Q: Context_1 : The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the governing party, having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats was formed. In 2015, the Conservatives led by David Cameron won a surprise majority and formed the first Conservative majority government since 1992. However, the 2017 snap election on Thursday 8 June resulted in a hung parliament, and the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority. They are reliant on the support of a Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to command a majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal. The party leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister since 13 July 2016. It is the largest party in local government with 9,237 councillors. The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour Party. The Conservative Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defence, deregulation, and restrictions on trade unions.

Context_4 : The Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005. The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child. It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta. The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada. In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party. The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005. Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear. If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.

He was the founder and leader of two nationalist parties, 4th of August and Front Line, with the former political party not only playing a significant role in influencing and shaping the future direction of the Greek extreme right, but also standing in its own right as a prominent pre-junta political movement in general. He has also cooperated (according to interviews he gave to various publications, including one to Italian magazine \\"L'Europeo\\" in 1976, which were quoted and accepted as proof in a court of law where he was the plaintiff against author Nikos Kleitsikas) with various European neo-fascist groups (including the Ordine Nuovo), and figures such as Pino Rauti, Pino Romualdi, Giorgio Almirante, and others of the same ilk. He later briefly joined the right-wing party Popular Orthodox Rally, as its leading candidate in the 2004 elections. He hosts the weekly television show \\"Edo Ellas\\" (Εδώ Ελλάς in Greek) on the EXTRA-3 channel, and was the host of \\"Istorikes Mnimes\\" (Ιστορικές Μνήμες) on TeleAsty, Karatzaferis' TV channel.

It was never represented in the South African Parliament, neither in the apartheid era nor after democratisation. In 1989, it joined the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in declaring support for Jaap Marais, the leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party and has worked with the HNP on occasion since.

Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one?  Hint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. The answer to this question is:","output":"Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one. As one of the greatest scientists and inventors, Archimedes was known for creating machines that made work easier by utilizing the principles mentioned in the hint. Since Ptolemy's device was not a machine, it would not have the same advantages in terms of increasing force, distance, or changing direction, as Archimedes' machine. Therefore, Archimedes' device would be more likely to make work easier compared to Ptolemy's one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chris Christie of New Jersey laced into Senator Marco Rubio in an interview with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham this week, saying that Hillary Clinton will “cut his heart out.” Mr. Christie’s comments, in an interview on Wednesday with Ms. Ingraham, came in response to negative ads against the New Jersey governor that are being aired by a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Rubio. The spots highlight Mr. Christie’s embrace of President Obama in November 2012, immediately after Hurricane Sandy. The ad and Mr. Christie’s attack on the senator from Florida represent an escalation of tensions between the two Republican candidates a week before they take the stage with other rivals at their next debate in Charleston, S.C. “I’ve been in very tough races before,” said Mr. Christie, pointing to the attack-filled campaign that Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, ran against him in the 2009 New Jersey race for governor. “This isn’t my first rodeo,” he added. “And if Marco Rubio thinks by putting out a couple of negative ads on me that somehow he’s going to intimidate me it just shows how inexperienced” and “unprepared” the senator is to take on Hillary Clinton. He said that whoever faces Mrs. Clinton, who is now leading the polls of the Democratic field, must be someone “who has been through the wars,” Mr. Christie said. “Not somebody who’s a first-term United States senator who has never had a tough race in his life. This guy’s been spoon-fed every victory he’s ever had in his life.” He went on: “That’s the kind of person that we want to put on stage against Hillary Clinton? I don’t think so. She’ll pat him on the head and then cut his heart out.” Mr. Rubio has focused increasingly on Mr. Christie and others who are competing against him for establishment support, after waging a battle against Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative favorite, for several weeks. Mr. Christie attacked Mr. Rubio for absenteeism from the Senate recently; Mr. Rubio’s team responded by pointing to Mr. Christie’s own long disappearances from New Jersey during his presidential campaign. In remarks to reporters after meeting with voters in Nashua, N.H. on Thursday, Mr. Rubio let out a loud chuckle when asked about Mr. Christie’s comments. And he quickly tried to deflect the focus away from questions about his readiness as a candidate and toward Mr. Christie’s mixed record as governor of New Jersey. “Chris has a very liberal record for a Republican. I mean he supported Common Core. He ran for office as a supporter of gun control. He personally gave a contribution to Planned Parenthood. So I’m sure he doesn’t really want to have a conversation about the issues because the truth is our next president has to be someone who’s going to overturn all the damage Barack Obama has done to America, not continue it. And we’ll continue to talk about the policy differences that I have with Chris or anyone else in this race.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about two people who want to be the next President of the United States.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop?  Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands.  Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.","output":"The farmer who did not increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop is Bubba. Here is how I reached this conclusion: 1. The paragraph states clearly that both Bubba and Dean were aware of the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil.     2. However, only Dean took active steps to promote the growth of this fungi by growing cover crops on his lands. This is important because, as the hint suggests, AM fungi are biotrophic and rely on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. By planting cover crops, Dean extended the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring, thereby promoting the establishment of a more extensive hyphal network. 3. This network would subsequently lead to an increase in extraradical hyphal colonization, which in turn benefits the new crops planted as they can tap into this well-established hyphal network for adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, thus improving crop yield. Since Bubba did not grow cover crops in his field, it can be inferred that he did not enhance the growth of the extraradical hyphal network in his soil. Therefore, the answer to the question is Bubba."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo.      Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched an attack on IS militants near Tikrit.      The city was among the areas in Syria and Iraq seized by IS this year.      Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the SOHR, said IS was using Iraqi officers who were pilots under ex-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to train fighters in Syria.      \\"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,\\" he said.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The aircraft are said to be MiG-21s, like this Indian Air Force jet outside Delhi in 2012, or MiG-23s      It is not known how many Iraqi pilots have defected.      Witnesses told the SOHR the planes appeared to be MiG-21 or MiG-23 models.      The BBC's Sally Nabil in Baghdad says IS has three planes which it captured earlier from the Syrian military in Aleppo and Raqqa.      US Central Command spokesman Col Patrick Ryder told Reuters the Pentagon was \\"not aware\\" of IS conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere.      Aleppo became a key battleground in the fight between Syrian rebels, which now include IS, and government forces after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.      New co-ordination      Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route.      Correspondents say that past efforts by the government to regain territory in the area have ended in failure.      Image copyright AFP Image caption The mainly Kurdish town of Kobane is strategically important in the fight against IS      Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane.      US-led warplanes struck IS positions on Friday, taking advantage of new co-ordination with the town's Kurdish defenders.      The Pentagon confirmed there were six air strikes near Kobane, saying initial reports indicated they successfully \\"struck three IS buildings, destroyed two IS fighting positions, suppressed three IS fighting positions and destroyed two IS vehicles\\".      There was another air strike on an IS oil facility near Shadadi.      The US military also said its \\"partner nation military forces\\" had conducted two air strikes in Iraq, near Baiji.      On Thursday, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal told the BBC that the militants had been driven out of most of Kobane.      Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting.      The battle for Kobane, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab, is regarded as a major test of whether the US-led coalition's air campaign can push back IS.      Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.      More than 160,000 people have fled in the face of the IS advance.      Capturing the town would give the group unbroken control of a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding... (Associated Press)      The report by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights could not be independently confirmed, and U.S. official said they had no reports of IS militants flying jets in support of their forces on the ground.      The new development came as the Islamic State group in Iraq pressed its offensive on the strategic city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad. The militants appeared to be taking advantage of the focus of U.S.-led airstrikes on the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, along the border with Turkey, to concentrate on their second front in Iraq.      The Observatory said the planes, seen flying over the Jarrah air base in the countryside of Aleppo province in eastern Syria this week, are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets. Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Observatory, said the planes have been flying at a low altitude, \\"apparently to avoid being detected by Syrian military radar in the area.\\"      He described the flights as a \\"moral victory\\" for the Islamic State group, saying \\"the jets could not fly much further without being knocked down by the (international) coalition.\\"      The report on the IS flights in Aleppo added yet another layer of complexity to the Mideast crisis in the wake of the onslaught by the Islamic State militants.      The U.S. and its allies are bombing IS bases in Syria and Iraq, where the extremists have seized large swaths of territory.      During its blitz, the Islamic State group is known to have seized fighter jets from at least one air base it captured from the Syrian army in the eastern Raqqa province earlier this year. Militant websites had posted pictures of IS fighters posing next to the fighter jets, but it was unclear if they were operational.      Abdurrahman said Islamic State members were being trained by Iraqi officers who had joined the group and who were once pilots under Saddam Hussein.      In January, Islamic State militants also captured the Jarrah air base in Syria after bitter clashes with rival extremists and Syrian rebel groups. A mix of several Islamic rebel groups battling Syrian President Bashar Assad — including al-Qaida's Syrian branch, the Nusra Front — had seized the base from government troops in early 2013.      Gen. Lloyd Austin, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, said he has no operational reports of IS militants flying jets in support of their forces on the ground.      Austin, the head of U.S. Central Command who is directing the fight in Iraq and Syria, told Pentagon reporters that he also has no information about Iraqi pilots defecting to IS.      However, an Iraqi intelligence official said the government in Baghdad is aware of several ex-Iraqi military officers going to Syria to train militants with the Islamic State group.      The militants acquired war planes from al-Tabaqa air base in Syria but did not get any when they toppled the Iraqi military in Mosul, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media.      Meanwhile, clashes between Syrian Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants continued on Friday in the town of Kobani, along the Syrian-Turkish border.      The Kurdish fighters have begun sharing information with the U.S.-led coalition to coordinate strikes against Islamic State militants there, a Kurdish official said.      The admission could further complicate relations between Washington and Turkey, which views the main Syrian Kurdish militia with suspicion because of its links to the Kurdish PKK insurgent group.      \\"There is direct coordination between Kurdish and American coalition forces,\\" Nawaf Khalil, spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, told The Associated Press. \\"That's no secret. It began about a week ago,\\" he said.      The party's armed wing, known as the People's Protection Units or YPG, has been struggling to defend the town — also known under its Arabic name, Ayn Arab — against the Islamic State militants, despite dozens of U.S.-led airstrikes against the extremists.      Kurdish fighters provided \\"correct and credible intelligence\\" early on, building trust with the U.S.-led coalition, Khalil said. There was no immediate comment from U.S. military officials.      The battle for Kobani has emerged as a key test for the U.S.-led air campaign against the IS group in Syria, with the vast majority of strikes conducted in and around the embattled town.      Turkey has ground forces and tanks deployed just across the border but has declined to intervene. It views the Syrian Kurdish YPG as an extension of the PKK, which has waged a long and bloody insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the United States and NATO.      Khalil's acknowledgement of coordination came after State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that U.S. officials had met with members of the Syrian Kurdish party for the first time.      Khalil said the meeting took place last week in Paris, and that it wasn't the first time the two sides had met. \\"The contact isn't new, but the admission of it is,\\" he said.      He said the party had not publicized the meetings because it did not want to cause more strife between Ankara and Washington.      ___      Associated Press writer Vivian Salama contributed to this report from Baghdad. ||||| BEIRUT Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.      The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.      Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.      U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.      \\"They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,\\" Abdulrahman said.      \\"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,\\" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.      Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.      It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.      U.S. MILITARY KEEPING \\"CLOSE EYE\\"      \\"We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,\\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.      \\"We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.\\"      General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.      \\"We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,\\" he told a Pentagon news briefing.      Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.      The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

Answer the following question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.  Question: suppose less toxins to remove happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there are fewer toxins for the liver to remove, the workload on the liver would initially be reduced as it will have to process a lower volume of harmful substances. This could potentially lead to the liver functioning more efficiently with respect to other tasks it carries out. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the cleansing of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion, this process may be affected in the following ways when there are fewer toxins present: 1. More efficient blood cleansing: Since the liver has a reduced workload in terms of detoxification, it may have more capacity to focus on the blood cleansing process. This means that it could potentially function more efficiently in removing waste materials and preserving the beneficial components in the blood. 2. Enhanced processing of vitamins and minerals: The liver's primary role in processing vitamins and minerals for the body would have a more significant impact as there would be less interference from the detoxification process. This could lead to enhanced absorption of these nutrients and their better integration into the body's various metabolic processes. 3. No effect: It is also possible that the liver's efficiency in processing blood enriched with vitamins and minerals remains unchanged. The lessened workload in detoxification may not necessarily affect the liver's capacity to cleanse the blood and process nutrients for the body effectively. The liver is an incredibly adaptive and resilient organ, and a minor change in the toxin removal process may not necessarily alter its efficiency in carrying out its other functions. In conclusion, if there are fewer toxins for the liver to remove, the liver may function more efficiently in cleansing the blood and processing its contents. However, the extent to which this occurs would depend on the liver's overall capacity and how well it adapts to the reduced workload. It could result in more, less, or no change at all in its efficiency concerning the second effect mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \\"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning.

Your questions should have a point and help to tell what kind of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the topic of conversation. If someone insists on one topic, it means he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the voice. If the voice sounds bored, then, it's time for you to change the topic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is the following review positive or negative? I ordered flowers from My Angels Touch yesterday to send a nice bouquet to my friend today for her wedding shower. The picture and description of the bouquet was very specific on the website, so I was sad and disappointed when my friend sent me the picture of the bouquet that arrived. First, it was not as full and pretty as the picture, the daisies were wilted, and we couldn't find the lilies that were supposed to be in it. I called the shop to complain and the daughter of the owner called her mom to tell her she didn't put lilies in the bouquet (I overheard the conversation). The mother called me back and said she had included them and tried to say I didn't know what lilies were (I realize these aren't supposed to be stargazers). So my friend looked closer and we saw there were little green wilted things that didn't look like lilies at all. I told the owner (politely too) that this bouquet looked like a cheap grocery store one. Plus, I purchased the step up from the original bouquet on the website. She said that was offensive to her...to HER. She said if I'm really upset, she can send more flowers tomorrow. Unfortunately, my friends wedding shower is today and I even posted a screenshot of my email receipt to show that the wilted flowers in the picture are from the same day of delivery (not days later). The owner said she stands by her product so I told her the pictures could stand for her product too then. All together I spent 70 on what was maybe the equivalent of a 20 bouquet from the grocery store. The flowers were unhealthy and I'm sad that my friend didn't get to have a nice bouquet on her special day. Super disappointed that the owner wouldn't help me out by at least replacing the bouquet today or just admitting she didn't have fresh flowers to deliver on this order so that I could buy nice ones from another shop. Terrible business, listen to all of the reviews here because they're not lying. Wish I had. I uploaded the pictures to this business' page. Take a look and see for yourself.","output":"This review is negative.

Many of the patterns in here are quite intuitive; meaning, that one probably doesn't need a book to be able to figure out how to knit them. Books with felting patterns should highlight patterns that are difficult to create. Otherwise, what's the point of buying a book? The challenges of felting are in determining scale and ratio, and anticipating shrinkage when you felt the item. None of these patterns are particularly interesting or nice-looking.Given its 2003 press date, I would have liked to see more fashionable items like a bucket hat, a striped felted bag with closure, and more useful household items, like a fruit bowl. Instead, the patterns include a bowler hat, felted mittens, dowdy looking slippers and several simple square bags. Its saving grace is a nice-looking felted rug, but I could have probably figured that one out as well. Isn't it just a rectangle? Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"[1]. Yes. The product review is negative because it highlights the reviewer's disappointment with the knitting book due to the lack of challenging and fashionable patterns, as well as the simplicity of the designs.

(WRDW/WAGT) – News 12 reported on an exclusive story about one charter school giving parents the option for using paddling as a corporal punishment in class. Since then, news outlets like the National Geographic, BBC and other national and international news tellers have shared that story.      Parents at GSIC are speaking out about the consent forms sent home earlier this month. Lacie Dickerson says her daughter, Lydia, shocked her with the paper.      \\"Lydia said, ‘mom I have a paper I need you to sign’, I said ‘well what is it?’ And she said it’s a ‘can they spank me or not form’,\\" Dickerson laughed.      She has two kids at GSIC. Parents got a consent form asking to use corporal punishment on their kids this school year.      \\"It's 2018 and they are sending that home. It's ridiculous,” parent Justin Cohen fumed. \\"The whole policy is ridiculous.\\"      It’s a policy that spells out the punishment with a large, wooden paddle. If signed, an administrator could spank them behind closed doors, but no more than three times.      But these two parents have two very different opinions. Cohen's son is a first-grader at the charter school.      Lia Fernandez: \\"When your son handed you this consent from, what were you thinking?\\"      Justin Cohen: \\"For GSIC to go ahead and [say] 'we want to paddle your child because we think it's a good idea…no.”      Cohen says it's not just about checking off yes or no. He says it's almost like a punishment if he marks no, because in that case it means upwards of five days of suspension for his child.      \\"It's thinly veiled coercion. If you don't sign it, if you don't let us paddle your child, we're going to suspend them for 5 days.”      Dickerson has a different point of view when it comes to Lydia.      \\"It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it because we came out of Jefferson County, and when they were in elementary school they were paddling there,\\" Dickerson explained to News 12 Wednesday.      Jefferson and Burke Counties are both still enforcing corporal punishment. Dickerson’s child went to a school there before GSIC.      \\"When they were younger I always checked ‘yes’ when they were in Wrens, but they should call me first.\\"      Lacie says now that her kids are older, in 8th and 9th grade, she says they're too old to be spanked. Because of that, this time she checked “no”.      The principal says they almost have all the consent forms back. Out of the 650 students they have, she says a little over one-third of them show parents saying “yes” to paddling. But the majority of those parents are saying no.      Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018News 12 First at Five      HEPHZIBAH, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) -- An area school recently sent home consent forms informing them of a new corporal policy at an area school. The superintendent says they’ve received a little over a hundred forms back, a third of them giving consent to paddle their child.      “In this school, we take discipline very seriously,” said Jody Boulineau, Superintendent of GSIC.      GSIC is going old school with a new policy for this year.      \\"There was a time where corporal punishment was kind of the norm in school and you didn't have the problems that you have,” the Superintendent said.      You heard that right. Georgia School for Innovation and the Classics, a K through 9 charter school, is bringing back paddling students as a form of discipline.      \\"It's just one more tool that we have in our disciplinary toolbox that we can use,” Superintendent Boulineau said.      Parents got a \\"consent to paddle form\\" asking them if they're ok with administrators hitting their child with a wooden paddle.      \\"There's no obligation, it's not required. A parent can either give consent for us to use that as a disciplinary measure or they can deny consent,\\" he said.      The form spells it out: a student will be taken into an office behind closed doors. The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle.      The form says no more than three licks should be given. Superintendent Boulineau says the parent response has been across the board.      \\" I've heard 'great, it's about time, 'we're so glad that this is happening again, they should've never taken it out of schools'. All the way to 'oh my goodness I can't believe you are doing that'.\\"      A controversial policy that hasn't been around for years. If parents opt out of paddling, they have to agree to up to 5 days of suspension.      \\"I honestly feel like it's something that's not going to be used very often. Sometimes it's just kind of the threat of it being there becomes a deterrent in itself.\\"      This is actually still legal in Georgia and 19 other states but it's rare for a school to have a policy for it.      GSIC is the only school in our area that will start paddling students who are misbehaving this year.      Even if parents agree to it, they are contacted and the school says they will use a three strike policy so the paddling doesn't happen on the first or second offense. ||||| A school in Hephzibah, Georgia, is drawing national attention after sending consent forms to parents informing them of a new policy of using paddling as a form of punishment for students, CBS affiliate WRDW-TV reports.      The Georgia School of Innovation and the Classics (GSIC), a kindergarten-through-9th-grade charter school, is bringing back paddling — spanking a child on the behind with a wooden board — as a form of discipline. Superintendent Jody Boulineau told WRDW that about 100 parents sent back the forms, and one-third gave the school consent to paddle their child.      \\"In this school, we take discipline very seriously,\\" the superintendent said. \\"There was a time where corporal punishment was kind of the norm in school and you didn't have the problems that you have.\\"      Boulineau said parents can deny giving permission to the school. The form sent home explained the steps the school would take to discipline children with a paddle. \\"A student will be taken into an office behind closed doors. The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle,\\" the form, which was obtained by WRDW, reads. Students will be paddled after their third offense. The form also says \\"no more than three licks should be given.\\"      The paddle will be 24 inches in length, six inches in width and 3/4 inches in thickness, the form specifies. Parents will be notified if their child is to be paddled by an administrator, according to the form, which CBS News has not independently verified.      WRDW      \\"It's just one more tool that we have in our disciplinary toolbox that we can use,\\" Boulineau said.      The superintendent said the response from parents has varied. \\"I've heard, 'Great, it's about time, we're so glad that this is happening again, they should've never taken it out of schools.' All the way to, 'Oh my goodness, I can't believe you are doing that,'\\" he said.      Although paddling is seen as a controversial policy that has not been used widely in schools for years, it is legal in Georgia and 19 other states.      Parents who opt out of the paddling must agree to up to five days of suspension as punishment for their children. GSIC is the only school in the Augusta area that will start paddling students who are misbehaving this year.      Boulineau, as well as other administrators and board members, have not responded to CBS News' request for comment. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A school in Hephzibah, Georgia, has introduced a controversial policy of paddling as a form of corporal punishment for misbehaving students.

I was disappointed in my first visit to the Las Vegas location of this cafe.  I had lunch at the NM Cafe in Chicago several years ago and the experience was delightful and elegant. The food was fresh and the service was superb. I was excited to repeat this experience.  Today's lunch, however, was disappointing. The waitress seemed to be unconcerned. I ordered the salad with salmon. The salmon was pretty good, but the avocado was hard to find and the mixed greens were not fresh.   I ate more than half of the salad and didn't complain until the end. (My fault! I hate to complain and hardly saw my waitress anyway.)  By the time I had eaten half of my salad, I had set about ten pieces of wilted greens off to the side of my plate.   When I asked for the bill, I showed the waitress the wilted lettuce and said I expected more from NM. She barely made eye contact with me, apologized w/little expression, took the plate and returned w/the bill.   I will not return. Is this review positive or negative? OPTIONS: - negative. - positive.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Glue together cards with cutout centers.","output":"To determine the best solution for gluing cards with cutout centers, let's first consider two common types of adhesives: liquid glue and glue sticks. 1. Liquid glue: Pros: -Strong bonds: Liquid glues generally create a strong bond, which is essential for holding the cutout centers of the cards together. -Quick drying: Some liquid glues dry quickly, ensuring that your project won't be delayed for long periods. Cons: -Messy: Liquid glues can be messy, seeping through the cutout centers and affecting the appearance of the project. -Hard to control: It may be difficult to control the application of liquid glue, leading to uneven bonds or excess glue on the cards. 2. Glue sticks: Pros: -Cleaner: Glue sticks are less messy and easier to control, ensuring that the cutout centers remain clean and the cards stay intact. -Easier application: Glue sticks are easier to apply, and you can quickly cover a larger area of the card, even around the cutout center. Cons: -Weaker bond: Glue sticks are less strong than some liquid glues, potentially causing the cards to separate over time or with handling. -Slow drying: Some glue sticks may take longer to dry, which can be problematic if you are working on a time-sensitive project. Based on the pros and cons of each adhesive, the best solution for gluing cards with cutout centers would be to use a glue stick. While they may have a slightly weaker bond than liquid glue, glue sticks offer a cleaner, easier-to-control solution that is less likely to damage the appearance of the cards or the cutout centers. If you're concerned about the strength of the bond, consider using a high-quality glue stick designed for heavier materials or reinforce the glued areas with transparent adhesive tape once the glue has dried."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian Pāṇini, who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his \\"Aṣṭādhyāyī \\". Hypothesis: Context is not part of linguistics.","output":"After reviewing the given paragraph, it appears that the provided hypothesis, \\"Context is not part of linguistics,\\" is not true. In the paragraph, linguistics is defined as the scientific study of language, and it specifically highlights three main components of its analysis; language form, language meaning, and language in context. Language form refers to the physical structure of language, encompassing the rules for constructing words, phrases, and sentences. Language meaning encompasses the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning, often analyzed through syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Lastly, language in context refers to the way language is used in real-world situations, involving factors such as social, cultural, and situational contexts in which communication takes place. Since the paragraph clearly states that language in context is an integral part of linguistics, the hypothesis claiming that context is not a part of linguistics is false. The broader field of linguistics acknowledges the importance of contextual factors in the usage and understanding of language, as it is essential for understanding how language functions in the real world, and guides our interpretations of intended meaning. Additionally, the study of language in context includes areas such as sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and pragmatics, demonstrating that context is undeniably a significant aspect of linguistics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: To cope with feeling alone or lonely at night, find a way to entertain or distract yourself. If you truly enjoy your selected hobby, your time alone will be transformed from something you dread to something to look forward to. Consider the following activities to keep you busy:  Reading Watching television Listening to music Writing You may have a difficult time sleeping alone at night because of feeling lonely, missing the partner you used to sleep with, or hearing strange noises. To cope with sleeping alone, turn off your television, tablet, or computer about an hour before bedtime to prepare yourself for sleep. You can also make falling asleep easier by: Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and food too late in the day Avoiding stressful activities, like exercise, right before bed Keeping the room lights on low Playing soft music Using a sound machine or ear plugs to drown out other noises Keeping the room cool Using comfortable, soft bedding, like a body pillow Wearing a sleep mask or using curtains to block out light Getting up to read, take a bath, or drink hot tea if you find yourself tossing and turning Having a structured evening for yourself at home will help keep your thoughts from straying into loneliness when you’re alone at night. Having a routine can also help keep you motivated and feel fulfilled while being alone. For example, if you come home from work at 5 p.m., you can schedule time for relaxation, exercise, dinner, socialization, and perhaps a hobby before bedtime. It can be helpful to keep a regular bedtime, although a perk of being alone is that you can go to sleep whenever you want! When you live alone or are alone at night, it may feel like a waste of time to make yourself a meal and sit down at the table to eat. However, making your meals special and keeping your mealtimes consistent is a good way to ward off loneliness at night. For example, if you’re alone at night on a holiday, fix yourself the meal you typically would have had with your family or others. As you eat, you can relive special memories you have of that holiday and feel less alone. Although there may be many hardships or negatives to living alone and being alone at night, like having to take care of all the chores on your own, try not to dwell on those. Reminding yourself of the positives can help improve your state of mind. For example, being alone allows you to:  Play whatever music or television shows you want to Clean up how and when you want to Decorate your house how you want to Have silence and time to recharge the way you want to Although being alone doesn’t necessarily mean you’re lonely, it’s important to recognize and accept any feelings of loneliness or sadness you may be experiencing.

Question: During what time period was there the largest growth of scientific societies? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century. Answer:","output":"The largest growth of scientific societies occurred during the 18th century, as evidenced by the fact that over seventy official scientific societies were founded in Europe by 1789.

Sometimes, what gets called \\"macho\\" is really just a guy compensating for a lack of confidence in himself and his ability to care for those around him. Guys who can't keep their own household together have to lash out at other guys, brag to everyone around them about how great they are, to keep up the status-quo.

This article: During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff. contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the two people who formed the supergroup?, what is it ?

Question: What effect is displayed on a disc with 77 lines, spinning at 77.92 rpm, when exposed to 50 Hz light? Context: In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor. This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.

Summarize: Pope Francis' trip this weekend to the Greek island of Lesbos, which hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have used as a stepping stone in their trip to northern Europe, clearly emerges from the Pope's own personal desire. Migrants and refugees have always occupied a central part of his discourse - and so has his criticism of the way developed countries have dealt with this crisis. \\"All too often,\\" he said recently of migrants, \\"[they] meet along the way with death or, in any event, rejection by those who could offer them welcome and assistance.\\" In two speeches - at the Moira refugee centre and at the Mytilene port - Pope Francis is set to urge leaders and societies to show more compassion for those fleeing war and poverty. But more than anything, the short visit is seen as hugely symbolic - and if you look at Pope Francis' travel record, it seems that for him, making an appearance is enough of a message. In July 2013, his first trip outside Rome after being elected pontiff was to Lampedusa, the tiny Italian island off the coast of Libya that - like Lesbos - was becoming a symbol of the incipient migrant crisis. The visit occurred months before the attention of the world turned to the deadly crossing between Libya and Italy. Ever since then, it became clear that travelling to the front line of a conflict would become a recurring feature of Pope Francis' travel agenda. And it has also become obvious that the Vatican is increasingly aware of the symbolic power that the Pope has - and the global media attention that comes with a visit by one of the world's most popular leaders. So the Pope is also using his seemingly unrivalled media power to shed light on certain conflicts around the world - even if this means pushing the boundaries on the definition of papal travel. Take his trip last November to the Central African Republic (CAR), one of the poorest countries in the world, ravaged by more than three years of armed conflict between Christians and Muslims. For months after the Vatican first announced the trip, observers insisted that it posed too high a security risk for the Pope himself and the crowds that were expected to greet him in Bangui. After all, never before had a pope visited an active war zone. Pope Francis, oblivious to calls to reconsider, went ahead with the trip - visiting a mosque and camp for displaced people, holding a mass at the cathedral and calling on factions to lay down their weapons. After the papal plane left the conflict has continued, but the visit did bring an enormous amount of media coverage to a conflict that ranks amongst the most under-reported war of our times. It was the \\"Francis effect\\", in full form. In 2014, moved by news of the savage murder by the mafia of a three-year-old child in the southern Italian region of Calabria, he travelled to the remote village of Cassano allo Ionio. At the stronghold of the local crime syndicate known as 'Ndrangheta, the Pope issued a strong message to mobsters: you are all excommunicated. And his words reverberated across the Italian peninsula, where the mafia continues to expand its tentacles. Full of standout moments too was his presence at the fence between Mexico and the United States earlier this year, or his visit to Cuba in September last year, where he supported the historic thawing of the island's relationship with the United States. But is there anything more than pure symbolism in the Pope's travels? Sometimes his attempts to mediate in international conflicts are seen as naive, if not somewhat clumsy. During his trip to the Holy Land in May 2014, at the end of a mass at Bethlehem's Manger Square, he broke the news that he was inviting the then Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to a \\"day of prayer\\" at the Vatican. A few weeks later, the event did take place and under the eye of the world's media the three leaders - joined by the Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew - shared a slightly awkward photo opportunity, during which they planted an olive tree in the Vatican Gardens. It is difficult to establish what concrete, on-the-ground effect - if any - such a gesture had on the decades-long conflict in the Middle East. But, ignoring the sceptics, this Pope seems keen to continue his policy of getting involved in continuing crises - visiting hotspots in what he calls the \\"peripheries\\" of the world and issuing strong calls for more mercy for the downtrodden. This weekend's trip to Lesbos is clearly emblematic of this approach. Profile: Pope Francis","output":"Pope Francis is set to continue his humanitarian efforts with a visit to the Greek island of Lesbos this weekend, where he will make two speeches urging leaders and societies to show more compassion for those fleeing war and poverty.

Answer:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following context:  In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity....  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music.

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson. Such a creepy individual, I didn't make that mistake again. Question: Who let the utility man into the house? Options:  A. The author.  B. The writer did.  C. not enough information  D.

Print out pictures of the haircut you want to show them to your stylist.  Common face shapes include oval, round, square, heart, and long. If you’re having trouble picking out a hairstyle, get your hair trimmed to just above your shoulders, with layering. This style is considered the “perfect haircut” because it looks great on everyone. Hats and hair accessories are also a great option for styling your hair. Use them to show off your personal style. You don’t need to wear makeup to be beautiful, but do it if it makes you happy. Use a foundation, tinted moisturizer, or BB cream to even out your skin tone. Then, play around with blush, eyeshadow, and lipstick that make you feel confident.  Do a natural makeup look if you don’t want to look like you’re wearing makeup. Do either a bold lip or a dramatic eye.

Product review: A large brown box appears on the doorstep of teacher, Elizabeth Stone's front door. Inside she would find the journals and inner workings of former student, former human being, former AIDS patient; Vincent.This book was extremely slow going. I felt that it asked too may questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it. Yes I am aware that Miss. Stone only had the journals as a reference yet I still believe this work could have been executed in a way as to end up with a much more impressive piece of writing.In reading \\"A Boy I Once Knew,\\" I also came across a variety of typos and errors thus proving the type of effort that went into the book.Stone also seemed to focus much more on her life than Vincent's, the one she meant to be preserved.When I look at this book as a whole I can't help but wonder if Vincent was made into the person he wanted the world to know.

There are several reasons for this assertion: 1. Slow pacing: The reviewer mentions that the book was \\"extremely slow going,\\" which implies that the narrative did not engage or hold their attention effectively. This could be viewed as a negative aspect for potential readers who prefer a faster-paced or more engaging story. 2. Lack of clarity and storytelling: The reviewer states that the book \\"asked too many questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it.\\" This suggests that the narrative might be confusing or difficult to follow, translating into an unsatisfactory reading experience for potential buyers. 3. Poor editing: The reviewer brings up the presence of \\"a variety of typos and errors,\\" which indicates a lack of attention to detail and proofreading during the publication process. This can be quite a frustration for readers who expect a polished and professionally edited work. 4. Misaligned focus: The reviewer believes that the author, Elizabeth Stone, focuses more on her own life than on Vincent's, who is supposed to be the main subject of the book. This could be disappointing for readers who are interested in learning more about Vincent's life and perspective. 5. Doubt over Vincent's portrayal: The reviewer questions whether Vincent was accurately and fairly represented in the book, expressing uncertainty about whether they were properly \\"introduced\\" to him. This might raise concerns among potential readers about the book's authenticity and the author's ability to capture the true essence of Vincent's story. Taking these factors into consideration, it is evident that this review would likely deter potential buyers from purchasing the product, as it highlights several significant shortcomings and disappointments regarding the book's content, editing, and overall presentation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the evening, Jessica came up to her mother and pleaded with her best puppy-dog-eyes to hear about the adventures of the Princess and the Magical Unicorn. Amy, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, switched on her warm and soothing mommy mode. Together, they went upstairs to Jessica's bright and cozy bedroom, which was decorated with soft fairy lights and dream-catchers swirling in the wind. The room had a beautiful lavender scent that filled the air and helped both mother and daughter relax after a long day. Amy picked the slightly worn out hardcover book from the shelf and opened it to the bookmark where they left off the previous night. With a mother's love, she gently tucked Jessica into the cozy duvet and let the soft light from the bedside lamp wash the pages of the storybook with a warm yellowish glow. The room was filled with a comfortable silence, interrupted only by the sound of the pages turning occasionally. Jessica snuggled into her bed, looking up at her mother expectantly as she waited for the story to unfold. Amy started reading, her voice lilting and mellifluous, painting the breathtaking Kingdom full of lush greenery and bright cotton-candy skies. The Princess was regal and benevolent, and her magical unicorn possessed a glittering rainbow tail, a shimmering horn and had an enchanted ability to talk. The enchanting tale continued, with the Princess and her magical unicorn going on a quest to save the Kindgom ruled by the captious Queen Morgana.

He decided on a milkshake because it is creamier (Option B). This decision was influenced by several factors that differentiate the two popular refreshing beverages in terms of texture, flavor, and nutritional content. Smoothies are typically made by blending fruits, vegetables, yogurt, and/or milk to create a beverage that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars. Smoothies are ideal for people looking for a healthier option to quench their thirst and satisfy their sweet tooth, as they often contain a balanced mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats. Moreover, smoothies are customizable in terms of ingredients, allowing for a wide range of flavor combinations and the ability to meet specific dietary needs. Milkshakes, on the other hand, are creamy concoctions made by blending milk with ice cream and flavored syrups. The extra air incorporated during the blending process, along with the thick, melted ice cream, gives milkshakes a velvety texture that is highly desirable to many consumers. Milkshakes are generally sweeter, denser, and higher in calories than smoothies, making them a decadent treat for those who wish to indulge. In this case, the man decided upon a milkshake due to its creamier consistency, which could offer several advantages. The texture is not only more pleasing to the palate for some people, but it can also feel more satiating and satisfying, making it a fulfilling choice for those looking to treat themselves. Furthermore, this rich and indulgent beverage is often served in restaurants as a dessert, providing a sense of indulgence and enjoyment that makes it a popular choice for many individuals. However, it is crucial to recognize that milkshakes may not be the best option for everyone, as their high fat, sugar, and overall calorie content may not align with specific dietary preferences or health goals. On the other hand, choosing a smoothie retains many of the same refreshing qualities and provides a greater level of nutritional value. Ultimately, though, the decision between a smoothie and a milkshake lies in personal preference, taking into account factors beyond just creaminess. An individual may need to consider their dietary goals, nutritional needs, desired flavor profile, and any allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients when making their choice. For the man in this scenario, his preference for the creamier, indulgent texture of the milkshake made it the better option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Consequently, 558 days (198 added to 360) passed between the time Mr. Bisner’s state convictions became final and the time he filed his federal habeas petition. Because this passage of time well exceeds the applicable one-year statute of limitations, the district court was correct in concluding that Mr. Bisner’s petition was untimely. In addition to arguing that his petition was timely filed, Mr. Bisner also argues for equitable tolling based on the fact that he lacked a law library, legal training, and knowledge of the limitations period, and had only limited assistance from prison contract attorneys.

Write a sentence based on \\"passenger train filled with holiday travelers derails in southern pakistan many feared dead\\"","output":"A catastrophic event unfolded in Southern Pakistan, as a passenger train, bustling with holiday travelers looking forward to their destinations, tragically derailed, instigating a palpable ambiance of dread and despair. This train, set on its course, serviced as a vital link that connected various regions in the country was filled to its capacity with enthusiastic passengers, each graced with the prospect of spending their holidays with their loved ones, a joyous and special time of the year that was drastically turned upside down. The rather desolate scene that resulted from this incidence echoed chilling apprehensive murmurs about fatalities.  Such a major rail accident has the potential to leave a substantial death toll, causing nation-wide sorrow and international concern. The scenes at the crash site were heart-wrenching as distraught family members harbored fear for their loved ones whose lives hung in the balance. Although the total number of casualties is yet to be confirmed, the high occupancy of the train and severity of the accident inevitably invokes the widespread fear about the number of deceased.  Moreover, the severity of the derailment gives rise to a multitude of questions, fundamentally probing the state of rail transit safety standards in Pakistan. This tragic accident thus hammers home the imperative need for stringent regulation, regular and meticulous maintenance checks, and upgraded safety measures in Pakistan's rail transit system.  As the investigation is underway, rescue crews are scrambling against time to pull trapped passengers from the mangled wreckage in an operation compounded by the remote location of the derailment. The authorities are also expected to launch a thorough investigation to identify the cause of the accident, which could range from mechanical failure, human error, or neglect of infrastructure, and seek to hold accountable any lapses which could have led to this catastrophe. For the bereaved families, it's a time of losing dear ones and grappling with an unreal & irreversible reality that their holiday joy abruptly ended in tragedy, equally daunting is the task for survivors coping with the traumatic experience and possibly life-altering injuries. The entire country, and beyond, shares in their profound sorrow, dismay, and shock. The international community is also urged to extend support in any way possible, be it through condolences, kind words, prayers, or tangible aid, to help the people of Pakistan bear this terrible loss. Ultimately, while we grieve and fear for the dead, such a tragic incident underscores the pressing necessity for stricter safety inspections, resilient infrastructures, well-maintained transport vehicles, thorough scrutiny in human operations, and enhanced promptness in rescue operations. It serves as a severe reminder that the safety of passengers, be it holiday travelers or daily commuters, should always be paramount, and no stone should be left unturned to ensure their safe journeys."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"A failing mental health trust has scrapped plans insisting governors do not talk to journalists without consulting it first, in case they say \\"things they don't mean\\".\\" Article:","output":"Title: Controversial Gag Order Lifted for Mental Health Trust Governors: A Move Towards Transparency and Open Dialogue in Mental Health Services Introduction In a surprising turn of events, a failing mental health trust has withdrawn its controversial plan to prohibit its governors from speaking to journalists without prior consultation with the trust. The now-scrapped plan was put in place to ensure that governors did not inadvertently express \\"things they don't mean\\" to the media. This decision has been applauded by mental health advocates and experts, who believe that open communication is vital in addressing the crisis of mental health service inadequacy in many regions. In this article, we will discuss the implications of this decision, its potential effects on the mental health trust's operation and how this move is a step in the right direction towards transparency and open dialogue in mental health care services. The Scrapped Plan: An Attempt at Damage Control The initial plan compelling governors to consult the trust before speaking to the media was designed as a damage control measure. Governors are considered to be the public face of a mental health trust, and as such, their statements have a powerful influence on the trust's reputation and public perception. Had this plan remained in place, it would have likely served as a barrier to open and honest communication, protecting the trust's image at the expense of genuine dialogue with stakeholders. Critics of the plan argued that it was an unwarranted restriction on freedom of speech and a lack of accountability on the part of the mental health trust. They expressed concerns that stifling the governors' voices could contribute to an environment of secrecy and opaqueness, making it even more challenging to address the trust's multiple issues. The Decision to Revoke the Plan: A Shift Towards Transparency The decision to withdraw the initial plan has been seen as an indication of the trust's willingness to be more transparent and embrace open communication. Mental health trusts play a crucial role in the mental health care system, and transparency is essential to ensuring effective interaction with stakeholders – including patients, mental health professionals, regulators, and the media. By revoking the plan, the trust demonstrates its commitment to establishing trust with these stakeholders, fostering an environment where challenges and shortcomings can be openly discussed and addressed. The Role of Open Dialogue in Mental Health Care Services There is no question that many mental health trusts are facing serious challenges, particularly in the context of funding limitations and increasing demand for quality mental health care services. Open dialogue plays an essential role in identifying these challenges and finding potential solutions. By encouraging governors to speak openly to the media and discuss the issues that mental health trusts are encountering, it becomes possible to raise public awareness and generate support for policy changes, funding, and resources needed to improve the mental health care system. A Step in the Right Direction The decision to scrap the plan requiring governors to consult the trust when speaking to the media is a positive move towards transparency and open dialogue in mental health care services. It reflects the trust's recognition that the most effective way to address challenges and improve mental health services is through open communication with stakeholders. The mental health care sector, both patients and professionals alike, will benefit from this renewed commitment to transparency. By embracing open dialogue, mental health trusts can work collaboratively with stakeholders, including the media, to raise awareness of mental health issues, improve services, and strive towards a more effective mental health care system. In conclusion, scrapping the controversial plan is an applaudable decision that signals a shift towards embracing openness and collaboration. Mental health trusts should continue to prioritize transparency, empowering their governors to speak candidly with the media and promoting open and honest communication regarding the challenges facing the mental health sector. It is through this commitment to open dialogue that mental health trusts can continue to make strides towards a more efficient, responsive, and patient-centered mental health care system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic élan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmer's house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing \\"Angel in Disguise\\", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims that he is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologizes to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness, prompting Elmer to take him back in, afraid he may have lost the inheritance for good. Later a special delivery letter arrives for Elmer, which informs him that Uncle Louie has  \\"kicked the bucket\\" and that he now inherits the 3 million.

The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up. Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive.

Please answer the following question: This article: The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Now, a new smart phone application (app) can help him figure out what colors he's using and how the picture looks to most everyone else.

In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved. \\"DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,\\"developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend. It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. \\"You can adjust the app to fit your needs.

They're so fragile even the players' breath risks nudging them out of tune. Turn up the temperature in the concert hall and you'd have, not a finely chiseled viola, flute or conga, but a glass of water. \\"And you'd be healthier for drinking it!\\" says Tim Linhart, ice-instrument maker extraordinaire to an orchestra playing a series of concerts throughout the winter in the remote Swedish town of Luleå, just beneath the Arctic Circle. Hearing is believing. Hearing really is believing when it comes to these evanescent instruments made -- bar the strings and other odd parts of metal or wood -- entirely from frozen water. Linhart has held ice concerts not only in Sweden over the past 15 years but also in far-flung locations from Beaver Creek, Colorado, to the Italian alps. His main problem, he says, in attracting a greater audience to the genre is people's incredulity that an ice instrument could make more than the most rudimentary sound. A recording of an ice violinist busking a solo classical piece outside Luleå's House of Culture in around -10 C is evidence to the contrary. The sound is sharp and ethereal, with a wide tonal range. Not only classical. But the ice repertoire doesn't include only refined, classical pieces. Along with the violins and a viola, cellos and a bass, there's an ice banjo in this year's lineup to accent country and bluegrass numbers. Six- and 12-string guitars suit rock 'n' roll, and an ice xylophone resting on bicycle inner tubes -- to aid its resonance -- works across the genres. As for the orchestra's gigantic spherical \\"bubble drums,\\" Linhart tells CNN, \\"they really shake your skeleton.\\" Doubtless they'll be deployed to funky effect in the -- inevitably, this being Sweden -- series of Abba-themed concerts among the 40 or so on the program this year. Winter pursuit. A stone sculptor in warmer months, the bearded Linhart, 53, makes all the instruments for the winter concerts in a six-week burst in his back garden. They're transported to a specially built igloo auditorium seating 170 people in a nature park outside Luleå, where the orchestra plays. Originally from New Mexico, Linhart was invited to this town of 80,000 residents in Swedish Lapland 10 years ago to take part in the building of one of the world's first ice hotels. He met his wife here. That's one reason he's stuck around, but no doubt it also helped that Luleå is one of the coldest towns in Sweden. Saving on its air con bills, Facebook is building its first server farm outside the United States in the town. Lovers of a cold climate. So, apart from loving a sub-zero climate, how else do ice instruments differ from the conventional kind? They're quicker to make, for a start, Linhart says. \\"I can do the carving on the front and back plate of a standup bass in two hours. \\"The chisel just glides through the ice. \\"My tools are similar to those of a regular instrument maker,\\" he says. But when it comes to sealing one of his creations together, \\"the only glue I use is water.\\" \\"If you want to glue a crack in an ice instrument, you just take a little straw, blow through it until the ice melts and then let it freeze again. \\"With wood, you can only carve. \\"With ice, you can also grow.\\" Just add water! Another difference from conventional instrument making? Linhart wears dishwashing gloves while he's carving, something you wouldn't see many master violin makers doing. Icy materials. The sculptor works mainly with \\"white ice,\\" a pearl-colored blend of water and snow that's especially flexible when frozen. Then there's clear ice: \\"Pure frozen water with no flaws, just molecule against molecule all the way through.\\" But it's harder to find. Northern Sweden is a good place to look, but you have to dig 20 centimeters beneath a lake surface to find the bubble-free stuff. Instruments wrought from either material are both more beautiful and more fragile than traditional instruments, Linhard says. What other instrument, he asks, lets the light shine through? Their unique visual qualities are exploited in the performances, when non-warming LEDs, constantly shifting in color, are placed inside the instruments. \\"It's like a nightclub in heaven,\\" Linhart says. Spring thaw. The instruments are exceedingly delicate. They melt in springtime and require constant maintenance before then. When played, the violins are suspended by strings from the ceiling to keep them from the musician's warm body. Just the breath from players and audience means every instrument has to be re-tuned slightly between each song. Such attention is worth it, says Linhart, for the exquisite sound these magical objects produce. \\"Ice instruments have a more detailed sound than wood, say, which absorbs the vibrations from the strings and dampens the sound,\\" he says. \\"Ice is stiffer. It picks up all the vibrations. \\"That's why it makes your hair stand on end. \\"You might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly clear -- until you hear an ice instrument and go, 'Ah ha!' \\"The clarity is crystal.\\" Flight plans. Up next on Linhard's icy agenda is an instrument dreamed up specifically for ice called the orgasmatron, after the machine in the Woody Allen film \\"Sleeper.\\" It's like a cello, but one a player bows from inside, making his or her body part of the sound. Linhart doesn't intend his ice-crafting career to end with instruments. His dream project is an ultralight airplane made from ice. Luckily, temperatures tends to get colder the higher you fly.

Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies.

The boys then go to other parts of New York to rally other newsboy groups, with Jack and David going to Brooklyn to recruit Spot Conlon (Gabriel Damon) and his group. Even with David's enthusiasm, Spot is still doubtul about joining them.At the same time, the boys catch the eye of Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a reporter for the 'New York Sun.'

Deploy your codes. Track your campaign. Article:","output":"Article: Imagine you're going on a treasure hunt, but instead of a traditional treasure map with a big \\"X\\" to signal where the treasure is hidden, you have a special kind of clue. This clue is like a splotch of ink – a jumbled, pretty puzzle of black and white squares. When you look at it with your magic spyglass (your phone's camera), it shows you a secret message or leads you to a hidden website. This magical clue is called a QR code. Steps to Create Your Own Magic Clue (QR Code): 1. Choosing the Perfect Magic Ingredient (Finding a QR Code Generator): The very first step in creating your own magical QR code is finding a perfect QR code generator. It's like the magic potion that helps you brew your own magic clue. Different magic potions (QR code generators) offer different secret services like colouring your QR code, resizing it, or even adding a logo. So, pick wisely! 2. Drawing Your Magic Clue (Designing Your QR Code): Have you ever painted a magic picture or scribbled a secret message in code? That’s what designing your QR code is like. You can choose what your magical clue (QR code) should do – say, lead to a hidden webpage, show a secret text, or even dial a secret phone number. Just like how each crayon color does something different on paper, each QR code does something unique. 3. Creating Your Magic Clue (Creating Codes): Now, it’s time to brew your magic clue! This means using your chosen magic potion (QR code generator) to make your magic clue (QR code). Just like how you might bake a cake, you just mix all your choices together – your secret message or website, your preferred colors or design – and voila! Out comes your magic QR code! 4. Hiding Your Magic Clue (Deploying Your Codes): Now let's put your QR code out there for others to discover, just like you would hide treasure clues on a treasure hunt. You can print your magic clue on posters, on flyers, on a billboard, or even in a book. When someone uses their magic spyglass (phone) to scan your clue, they will be led to your secret, whether it’s a message, a website, or another surprise. 5. Keeping Track of Your Magic Game (Tracking Your Campaign): Lastly, don’t forget to keep a watchful eye on your treasure hunt. You need to know how many brave adventurers are using their magic spyglasses to scan your clues. This is called tracking your campaign, and most magic potions (QR code generators) give you the ability to do this. Now that you know about QR codes and how they are like magical clues in a treasure hunt, you can start creating your own. Remember, every QR code you create is like a magical journey of discovery for everyone who scans it! Happy magic-clue creating!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017?, using the article: Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is not directly stated who the representative of the 7th congressional district is that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017. This task would require additional research not available within the text. It's important to note that congressional representatives are separate from the mayoral role that Jenny Durkan held within Seattle's mayor–council form of government. Jenny Durkan was indeed elected as the mayor in 2017, taking office on November 28th that same year but her role does not clarify the representative of the 7th congressional district. However, if we look at the context clues in the article, it indicates that the city's political culture leans heavily liberal and progressive, with a significant part of the population voting for the Democratic Party. This could suggest that the representative in question could possibly be a Democrat. But, without additional information, it would not be accurate to determine the specific individual representing the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle. If you wanted to find out the name of the current or past representative of the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle, a good start would be to conduct a search along the lines of \\"Who is the representative of the 7th congressional district in Washington state?\\" or \\"Who was the representative of the 7th congressional district in Washington state in 2017?\\". This would help you find out who the representative of that congressional district was at that particular point in time. It's also crucial to bear in mind that congressional districts are defined on a state level, as opposed to being tied to a specific city or mayor. Congressional districts can encompass whole cities, parts of cities, or multiple cities based on geographical and population factors. Thus, the person holding the position of mayor, such as Jenny Durkan, does not necessarily directly influence or determine the congressional representative for their district. To summarize, the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes Seattle, where Jenny Durkan was elected mayor in 2017, cannot be determined from the text provided in the article. Additional research would be required to answer this question accurately and exhaustively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

Thaddeus's passion for the welfare of his people, combined with his innate talent for diplomacy, helped shape Galdarath into a prosperous nation that others aspired to emulate. Thaddeus was well-known for his open-mindedness and willingness to learn from the experiences and perspectives of others. From humble farmers to skilled artisans, he valued the wisdom of his people, as he believed that everyone had something valuable to contribute towards the betterment of his realm. His court was always bustling with people from all walks of life, eagerly discussing matters of the day and offering solutions to the challenges their community faced. Thaddeus's dedication to aiding his people extended far beyond listening to their concerns and engaging in lengthy conversations. He implemented a variety of progressive reforms aimed at reducing inequality, improving education, and providing better infrastructure for his subjects. His government offered financial assistance to those in need and encouraged the cultivation of new industries that could benefit the people and economy of Galdarath. It was during Thaddeus's reign that Galdarath became recognized as a center for arts and culture. Thaddeus sought to foster the talents of his people not only in the pursuit of economic prosperity but also in the realm of intellectual and artistic expression.

Jerusalem (CNN)President Barack Obama and U.S. officials were completely blindsided by the announcement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come to Washington to address a joint session of Congress this spring -- a move that's rattled the White House and diplomatic officials. The announcement from House Speaker John Boehner's office this week came after several high-level interactions between U.S. and Israeli officials, including a phone call between Obama and Netanyahu and a multi-hour meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, a senior administration official told CNN. Netanyahu's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders, but U.S. officials insist the tensions won't affect U.S. support for Israel. Yet ahead of the elections, Netanyahu's visit may be a boon for him and his party in","output":"Israel, as it allows him to demonstrate his close relationship with the United States and his ability to navigate political situations in Washington. Additionally, it offers Netanyahu an influential platform to address issues concerning Israel, including Iran's nuclear program and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. However, the unusual manner in which the visit was announced, and the resulting tensions between the Obama administration and Israeli officials, raises questions about the long-term implications of this development on U.S.-Israel relations. Firstly, it is important to examine the rationale behind Netanyahu's decision to accept Boehner's invitation to address Congress without first notifying the White House. One possible explanation is that the Israeli Prime Minister and his supporters in the U.S. Congress want to convey a strong message about their commitment to defending Israel's security interests, particularly given the ongoing negotiations between the P5+1 countries (including the U.S.) and Iran over its nuclear program. By framing his speech in such a high-stakes, high-profile context, Netanyahu might hope to influence the outcome of these negotiations in a direction that he perceives as more favorable to Israel's interests. Another potential factor motivating Netanyahu's decision could be domestic politics, as the visit is scheduled to take place just weeks before the Israeli elections on March 23, 2021. By showcasing his ability to engage with U.S. lawmakers and secure American support, Netanyahu might be attempting to boost his re-election chances by demonstrating his strengths as a leader capable of defending Israel's interests on the international stage. Notwithstanding these potential benefits for Netanyahu, there are significant risks involved in pursuing this course of action. By accepting Boehner's invitation without first consulting the Obama administration, the Israeli Prime Minister risks further straining an already tense relationship between the U.S. and Israel. This could have negative consequences for cooperation between the two countries in areas such as military aid, intelligence sharing, and diplomatic support on the global stage. Moreover, by appearing to align himself more closely with the Republican Party in the U.S., Netanyahu risks alienating key Democratic supporters of Israel. This could exacerbate partisan divisions over Israel in Congress and ultimately weaken the traditionally bipartisan consensus on maintaining a strong U.S.-Israel alliance. In conclusion, Netanyahu's decision to accept an invitation to address a joint session of Congress without notifying the Obama administration carries both potential rewards and significant risks. The visit might provide the Israeli Prime Minister with an opportunity to influence the outcome of the P5+1 negotiations with Iran and boost his re-election prospects at home. However, it also risks causing lasting damage to the U.S.-Israel relationship by further straining ties between the two leaders and deepening partisan divisions in Congress over support for Israel. Ultimately, the long-term implications of this move will depend on how both U.S. and Israeli officials decide to navigate the complicated diplomatic terrain that this development has created."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
